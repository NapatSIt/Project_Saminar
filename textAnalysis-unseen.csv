Abstract
"Background Remote psychosocial intervention has been used by most health care organizations since the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic. However, the rapid introduction of this type of practice generates new methods of intervention that raise many questions, particularly about men who, in general, use face-to-face psychosocial intervention less than women. This documentary research aims to report on current knowledge on remote psychosocial intervention with men. Methods PICO technique was used to find relevant documents to achieve the objective of this research. In accord with our criteria, 62 documents were selected in several databases and search engines. The selected texts were subject to an analysis process consisting of two stages: the creation of reading sheets followed by a content analysis. Results The results underline the lack of scientific data on the men's experience when they initiate a request for help, the commitment process, and the effectiveness of the remote intervention. Several elements seem potentially promising, including patients' perceptions of having more power and freedom which could favorize engagement of men who have a traditional vision of masculinity. Conclusions It appears that gender-related variables are not commonly used when it comes to analyze the effects of distance psychosocial intervention. Other studies will be needed to have a holistic vision of the realities experienced by men towards the offer of remote psychosocial intervention."
"Purpose: The present study aims to contribute to the understanding of digital participation in heritage collections as a democratizing practice by identifying and challenging silent assumptions concerning how the insufficient influence of participants is conceived of as a problem. Design/methodology/approach: Three carefully selected scholarly texts incorporating problematizations of insufficient participatory agency were analyzed in detail using a method inspired by Carol Bacchi's approach “what's the problem represented to be?” (WPR), with special emphasis on analysis of ontological elements of the problematizations. Findings: Participation is problematized based on the assumption that participatory agency risks jeopardizing the protection of heritage and leads to parts of the public memory being forgotten. To challenge the idea that participatory agency is destructive, the present article argues for elaborating an understanding of what forgetting entails for heritage. Framing forgetting as a potentially both harmful and generative concept enables a separation of destructive forgetting (e.g. destruction of historical evidence) and constructive forgetting (re-contextualization). Research limitations/implications: The study is based on a limited number of texts, and problematizations are investigated in relation to a specific perspective on participatory agency. Practical implications: By understanding forgetting as a potentially beneficial activity for representation and heritage construction, the article provides a conceptual rationale for facilitating re-contextualization in the design of multi-layered information structures for heritage collections. Originality/value: There is little earlier research on the silent assumptions that affect how participation is understood and implemented. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Dancers need adequate cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) levels in order to cope with the demands of dance classes and choreographies. Screening and monitoring of CRF is advised. The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview of tests used to assess CRF in dancers and to examine the measurement properties of these tests. A literature search was performed in three online databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and SPORTDiscus) up until August 16, 2021. Study inclusion criteria were: 1. a CRF test was used; 2. participants were ballet, contemporary or modern, or jazz dancers; and 3. English full-text peer-reviewed article. General study information, participant information, CRF test used, and study outcome were extracted. If available, measurement property data were extracted (i.e., test reliability, validity, responsiveness, and interpretability). Of the 48 articles included in the review, most used a maximal treadmill test (n = 22) or the multistage Dance Specific Aerobic Fitness test (DAFT; n = 11). Out of the 48 included studies, only six examined the measurement properties of CRF tests: Aerobic Power Index (API), Ballet-specific Aerobic Fitness Test (B-DAFT), DAFT, High-Intensity Dance Performance Fitness Test (HIDT), Seifert Assessment of Functional Capactiy for Dancers (SAFD), and the 3-minute step test. Good test-retest reliability was found for the B-DAFT, DAFT, HIDT, and SAFD. Criterion validity was determined for the VO2peak of the API, the 3-MST, HIDT, and SAFD. For HRpeak, criterion validity was studied for the 3-MST, HIDT, and SAFD. While different CRF tests are being used in descriptive and experimental research within dance populations, the body of research supporting the measurement properties of such tests is very small. As many studies have methodological flaws (e.g., small participant numbers or no statistical analysis for validity or reliability), additional good quality research is required to re-examine and complement current measurement property results of the API, B-DAFT, DAFT, HIDT, SAFD, and 3-MST. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Against caricatures of the poet-philosopher Friedrich Schiller as an unoriginal popularizer of Kant, or a forerunner of totalitarianism, Frederick Beiser reinterprets him as an innovative, classical republican, broadening his analysis to include Schiller s poetry, plays, and essays not widely available in English translation, such as the remarkable essay, On Grace and Dignity. In that spirit, the present article argues that the latter text, misperceived by Anglophone critics as self-contradictory, is better understood as centering on gender and dance. In brief, grace is a virtuous power of beautiful gestures associated with women, while dignity is a power of sublime gestures associated with men, and the improvised combination thereof is a divinely androgynous power of gesture that I term stateliness, in a three-step choreography of aesthetic education. © 2023 Philosophy Documentation Center.

"Purpose: Knowledge organization (KO) has been advancing at a progressively rapid pace under the influence of information technology. This study aims to explore the topics, characteristics, and trends of KO research in the 21st century. Design/methodology/approach: The full text of 4,360 KO-related articles published from 2000 to 2021 is collected. Through content analysis, this study identifies the topics, research methods, and application areas of each article, and the statistics are presented through a series of visualizations. Findings: In total, 13 main topics, 105 sub-topics, 16 research methods, and 57 application areas are identified. Notably, classification has always been an important topic, while linked data, automated techniques, and ontology have become popular topics recently. Significant changing features have also occurred. The versatile use of research methods has increased, with empirical research becoming the mainstream. Application areas show a trend of refinement from subject areas to specific scenarios. Construction techniques present a combination of automated techniques, crowdsourcing, and experts. Originality/value: KO has evolved and diversified due to technological developments. This study is the first to focus on the continuous changing features over an extended, 21-year period, as opposed to sampling a few years. It also provides clues and insights for researchers and practitioners interested in KO to understand how it has changed in the Semantic Web and big data context. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Communication-based interventions are popular among both governmental and nongovernmental organizations in many environmental domains. Yet, studies on the role of humor in social media communication to stimulate pro-environmental behavior have received limited attention. This study employs an experimental approach to assess the effect of using humor (in the form of satirical cartoons) either alongside, or in place of, factual pro-environmental messages in social media communication. It assesses the impact of humor in stimulating a reaction to a pro-environmental message on social media, a share, or a declared intent to change behavior. Our findings reveal that the inclusion of humor elicits a greater response than a factual message alone but that combining a humorous cartoon with a factual text creates the greatest difference. These findings are fairly consistent across six environmental domains and survive formal regression analysis which controlled for the impacts of co-determinants such as age, gender, education, social media engagement, and environmental preferences. © 2023 by the authors.

"WhatsApp is one of the most popular mobile applications providing instant messaging and ease of access. It uses web-based systems to send and receive texts, calls, and videos and even offers video chat. However, during the current healthcare crisis, WhatsApp's role is comparatively more prominent and needs more consideration. In this context, we conducted this research to examine the factors motivating students to rely more on WhatsApp during the Covid-19 pandemic. Based on the Uses and Gratifications Approach, we adopted a cross-sectional design and gathered data from university students in Islamabad, Pakistan. Findings from n= 302 university-level students affirmed communication (p≥ .000), learning (p≥ .002), Teamwork (p≥ .041), and information sharing (p≥ .000) as the motivating factors behind increased WhatsApp usage (p≥ .011) during the healthcare crisis. Similarly, path analysis results also validated a strong correlation between the variables, further affirming the strength of the proposed conceptual framework. Thus, WhatsApp not only provided ease of communication during Covid-19 but also helped sustain educational activities. Here we recommend more studies to examine other different factors, especially personality factors that can affect one's WhatsApp usage. © 2023 Authors"
"[Objective] This paper addresses the challenges facing the traditional static word vector embedding method, aiming to handle polysemy in Chinese texts effectively. It also excavates the contextual emotional features and internal semantic association structure. [Methods] In one channel, we integrated the sentiment elements related to the text into Word2Vec and FastText word vectors through rough data reasoning. We also used CNN to extract the local features of the text. In the other channel, we employed BERT for word embedding supplement and used BiLSTM to obtain the global features of the texts. Finally, we added the attention calculation module for the deep interaction of dual channel features. [Results] The experiment on three Chinese datasets achieved the highest accuracy of 92.43%, representing an improvement of 0.81% over the best value of the benchmark model. [Limitations] The selected datasets are only for modelling coarse-grained sentiment classification. We did not conduct experiments in the fine-grained domain. [Conclusions] The proposed model could effectively improve the performance of Chinese text sentiment classification. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"As the mean age of first-time motherhood continues to rise throughout most of the western world, and increasingly also in emerging economies (OECD), normative notions of ""ideal"" first-time pregnancy age have shifted, and purely biological conceptualizations of fertility have been matched (and often challenged) by the emergence of the notion of ""social fertility"", which is often at a disconnect with biological fertility. The increasingly widespread availability of Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ARTs) has further extended the upper limits of childbearing age to the point that it has been possible for post-menopausal women to give birth. This has brought about a shift in the boundaries of ""normal"" - or even ""natural"" - motherhood, challenging the applicability of commonly accepted definitions of age-telated ""norms"" to women's life stages. ""While this process has been strongly contested, with charges of unnaturalness being levelled at older mothers, and especially at those who resort to ARTs, acceptance of older motherhood has become gradually more widespread. The linguistic strategies increasingly deployed in its representation have both reflected and contributed to this change. This chapter addresses discursive aspects of the construction of ""older mothers"" identities in contemporary discourses of age-related reproductive health and opportunities, focusing on medical discourse on the one hand, and self-representations of older motherhood on the other. While stigmatization of women who choose to postpone motherhood persists across multiple discursive domains, a shift is detectable in a growing body of texts which explicitly aims to neutralize social stigma by opting for categorizations which rely on more linguistically neutral terms. The chapter raises questions about the ideological implications of labelling strategies and about the impact of such labelling on discursive identity constructions, and offers insights into ""older"" first-time mothers' strategies of self-representation. © Peter Lang Group AG, International Academic Publishers, Bern 2023.

"PURPOSE The purpose of this study is to analyze the type of and interest in home training video contents using the YouTube platform. METHODS Web crawling was performed using Python and a total of 3,937 sets ofvideo information (title, content, number of views, upload date) were obtained, 3,155 of which were finally selected for the study material. Overlapping and unrelated content were excluded. The data of text underwent 3 stages of preprocessing, the TF and TF-IDF of the keywords were calculated to identify the main keywords, and the LDA algorithm was applied in the topic modeling to successfully identify the types. In order to understand the level of interest by type, the number of views was subdivided into the percentage of the assigned type. RESULTS First, the types of home training videos were classified into bare whole body exercise for aerobic and muscular power strengthening, Pilates exercise for core and upper body strengthening, upper body exercise using tools, lower body line exercise, posture correction and upper body stretching exercise for pain relief, hip-up exercise, dance and tabata exercise for diet, diet and lower body correction stretching exercise for diet, and bare body exercise for core and lower body strengthening. Second, it was found that the proportion and interest were high in the contents of bare whole body exercise for aerobic and muscular power strengthening, dance and tabata exercise for diet, diet and lower body correction stretching exercise for diet. CONCLUSIONS The findings of this study may provide baseline data about the development of the active online home training videos in the market. © Korea Institute of Sport Science."
"The current study aims to shed light on the often-overlooked Islamic history and its lasting legacy, countering the dominant western discourse. It seeks to highlight the creativity, innovation, and technology that emerged from the rich classical Islamic heritage. The remarkable civilization forged by Muslim scholars and scientists across various fields of human knowledge was only made possible due to their profound belief and religious duty to promote creativity in human existence. Therefore, the current research aims to present, a philosophical study of innovation and creativity based on the Qur’ān and Sunnah supported by classical and modern Islamic literature. This study also deploys an analytical and descriptive approach to conduct an analysis of present literature on Islamic origin. Moreover, this article is a scholarly attempt to demystify the principles and values that regulate the philosophy of creativity and innovation in Islām. Additionally, it presents an Islamic view on Muslim’s existing moral issues of innovation, creativity, and technology by drawing upon the teachings and principles of Qur’ān and Sunnah. To achieve the proposed goals of this article, many Islāmic texts that urge innovation, creativity, and pay a special concern to the talented and skilled, were consulted. Hence, the research determined that Islamic heritage has a lot to contribute to the modern conceptualization of innovative and creative human life, which motivates Muslims’ to compete with others in this regard. Consequently, there is no such thing in Islam that prevents a Muslim from excelling in technology, which brings benefits and repels harm, while following the principles and teachings of the Qur’ān and Sunnah. © The Authors."

"[Purpose/Significance] As an important entry scenario into the application layer of the meta universe, digital collections can not only solve the identity authentication and rights governance problems of digital resources in the meta universe, but also become an important interface connecting a library's physical entity and the virtual space of the meta universe. At present, digital collections have attracted much attention in digital art, digital publishing, digital cultural creation, museums and other fields, but relatively little attention has been paid in the field of libraries. As a new business form in the digital economy era, digital collectibles have typical characteristics such as uniqueness, traceability, immutability, and ease of ownership confirmation. They are the perfect display of digitalization, virtualization, and ownership confirmation of library collection resources (such as books, ancient books, map literature resources, and various digital resources) in the metaverse space of libraries. Therefore, based on a scientific definition of the connotation and characteristics of library digital collections, we attempt to explore their value chain of ""resources creativity casting dissemination service"". [Method/Process] This article analyzes the differences and connections between the metaverse and digital collectibles, explains the connotation and characteristics of library digital collectibles, and conducts in-depth analysis of the paradigm construction of library digital collectibles' value chain from the perspective of the metaverse from five dimensions: resource end, creative end, casting end, distribution end, and service end. The scene embedding of its value chain is divided into structural embedding. There are three modes of functional embedding and memory embedding and they are explained separately. [Result/Conclusion] Research suggests that digital collections mainly originate from NFT, which is a local concept of NFT's localization of digital assets in China. Digital collections mainly include works of art, ancient books and documents, precious cultural relics, digital cultural creation, digital publications, model surroundings, news collections, digital music, 3D models and other types. Their digital resources are mainly text, images, audio, video and 3D models. Their creation sources are mainly from physical entity resources and virtual digital resources. Library digital collections are generated based on the policy environment, technical conditions, resource structure, business characteristics, and cultural precipitation in which Chinese libraries are located. They strip away the attributes of NFT virtual finance and virtual currency, and have Chinese characteristics and library business characteristics. Blockchain (especially alliance chain) technology is used to digitize the casting, distribution, and circulation of library specific collection resources, literature resources, or digital resources, the only trusted digital rights certificate provided for collection and use. © 2023 Authors.

"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is potentially associated with numerous changes in the life of the general population; nevertheless, to date there is hardly any evidence on which effects are experienced as particularly severe and negative, how these effects and their evaluations changed over the course of the pandemic and which wishes for support arose in this context. Method: Longitudinal data from an online study with 10 assessments over the first 2 years of the pandemic (March 2020–April 2022) were analyzed in a mixed methods approach. The sample of 8337 adults from the general population in Germany answered qualitative free text questions about the most severe consequences of the pandemic on their lives and need/wishes for support. In addition, the evaluation of the consequences over the course of the pandemic and their associations with psychological distress were quantitatively examined. Results: The consequences experienced and especially their evaluation changed over the course of the pandemic. On average, consequences targeting social and life in general aspects were experienced as particularly severe and negative. Negatively experienced consequences were cross-sectionally and partly also longitudinally associated with stronger anxiety and depressive symptoms. Psychotherapeutic and evaluative communicative support was particularly frequently requested in the context of the pandemic. Conclusion: Subjectively negatively experienced consequences of the pandemic should if possible be mitigated by adequate measures. The dynamic changes of the consequences and thus also the need for support over the course of the pandemic should be taken into account. Possible support options range from very low-threshold offers (e.g., tips online) up to psychotherapy. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Purpose: This paper explores the effect the regional technological environment has on technology-driven performance, measured by enterprise resource planning (ERP). Design/methodology/approach: This study specifies a productivity-based production function driven by ERP system adoption. Employing a quasi-experimental research design, the author disentangles two effects – the average effect of ERP adoption and the moderation effect of the regional technological environment. The novelty of this study is that it merges publicly available information retrieved via text-mining tools and official financial reports published by companies. Findings: The total effect of technology adoption on productivity varies from almost 3%–9% in different technological environments. Moreover, this study’s results revealed that the regional technological environment could enhance the effect of adopting different ERP systems. Originality/value: While some papers investigate the relationship between ERP adoption and firm performance regarding the environmental context of a firm, the effect of the regional technological environment on the relationship between technology adoption and firm performance is understudied. Thus, this research tries to contribute to a deeper understanding of the regional context's impact on technology-driven performance. The authors used automated content analysis to collect data on technology adoption; by doing so, this study contributes to the growing body of research utilising the text-mining approach to extract data stored in Internet-based information sources. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Understanding different aspects of public concerns and sentiments during large health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, is essential for public health agencies to develop effective communication strategies, deliver up-to-date and accurate health information, and mitigate potential impacts of emerging misinformation. Current infoveillance systems generally focus on discussion intensity (i.e., number of relevant posts) as an approximation of public awareness, while largely ignoring the rich and diverse information in texts with granular information of varying public concerns and sentiments. In this study, we address this grand challenge by developing a novel natural language processing (NLP) infoveillance workflow based on bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT). We first used a smaller COVID-19 tweet sample to develop a content classification and sentiment analysis model using COVID-Twitter-BERT. The classification accuracy was between 0.77 and 0.88 across the five identified topics. In the sentiment analysis with a three-class classification task (positive/negative/neutral), BERT achieved decent accuracy, 0.7. We then applied the content topic and sentiment classifiers to a much larger dataset with more than 4 million tweets in a 15-month period. We specifically analyzed non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) and social issue content topics. There were significant differences in terms of public awareness and sentiment towards the overall COVID-19, NPI, and social issue content topics across time and space. In addition, key events were also identified to associate with abrupt sentiment changes towards NPIs and social issues. This novel NLP-based AI workflow can be readily adopted for real-time granular content topic and sentiment infoveillance beyond the health context. © 2023 by the authors.

"This study explored the effect of English language learners’ breadth and depth of vocabulary knowledge on their understanding and grades of reading English texts. Sixty-one Jordanian EFL undergraduates were assigned three tests, which were the Vocabulary Levels Test Version 2 (VLT), the Word Associates Test (WAT), and Academic International English Language Testing System (IELTS). The collected data was analysed utilizing Pearson correlation analysis and multiple linear regression. According to the empirical outcomes, breadth and depth of vocabulary knowledge correlated positively with each other and with reading comprehension. Further, the significant predictor of the overall variance of reading comprehension was vocabulary depth, while the breadth of vocabulary knowledge was the less significant one. The results demonstrate the importance of expanding and deepening EFL learners’ vocabulary knowledge in classrooms. © 2023 JJMLL Publishers/Yarmouk University. All Rights Reserved."
"Now that students in our introductory object-oriented programming course are more familiar with Zoom and screen sharing, we consider novel assessments that leverage these tools. We developed a style of assessment where students submit a recorded screencast of them tracing a submitted program. We describe the design of the assessment and tracing prompts, and we report on an analysis of 59 submitted student videos. Our findings include common mistakes and aspects of student understanding that were expressed in the video but not in the text and code submitted by students. For example, we observed different strategies that yielded the same correct trace of a loop, as well as incorrect traces of students' own correct recursive programs. These guide us towards ways to refine the assessment and prompts in future iterations. © 2023 Owner/Author."
"[Purpose/Significance] Interdisciplinary research can creatively solve complex problems in natural environment and human society through knowledge integration and penetration. With the increase of interdisciplinary research results, the evaluation of interdisciplinarity becomes increasingly necessary. How to establish an effective method for interdisciplinarity measurement and achieve a comprehensive measurement of scientific research papers is an urgent problem to be solved. [Method/Process] Based on the above background, this study takes the data of scientific research papers as the analysis source, deconstructs the interdisciplinarity of scientific research papers from multiple dimensions, constructs the feature set of interdisciplinarity of scientific research papers, and on this basis proposes the method for measuring interdisciplinarity based on the adaptive method of machine learning, and conducts a comprehensive measurement of interdisciplinarity. This study has certain positive significance for researchers to understand the interdisciplinary papers in the field. The work process is as follows: First of all, the basic concepts of interdisciplinarity are sorted out and related concepts are discriminated, and the index of interdisciplinarity of different dimensions is analyzed. Based on the connotation and characteristics of interdisciplinary research, the characteristic index of interdisciplinarity of scientific research papers is extracted from three dimensions: subject attribute, knowledge network topology and knowledge integration text content. Secondly, an interdisciplinarity measurement method based on machine learning is constructed. By analyzing information gain and feature similarity of input indexes and data in feature sets, a feature selection calculation method based on adaptive feature selection is proposed, and the accuracy of feature classification is maximized by machine learning classifier. At the same time, the feature subset that can best express the interdisciplinary is selected based on the adaptive selection of the minimum number of features, and the selected adaptive feature set is used in the calculation of the interdisciplinary of the paper, and the results of the calculation of the original feature set are analyzed comprehensively. Finally, an empirical study was carried out in the field of plant nanobiotechnology to verify the effectiveness of the index system and adaptive feature selection listed above, identify and screen papers with high interdisciplinarity in the field, measure the interdisciplinarity of papers and identify key influencing factors based on the calculation of subject attributes, knowledge network topology and knowledge integration text content features. [Results/Conclusions] The main empirical results show that, among the subject attributes, the balance degree and the difference degree have a greater effect on the interdisciplinary evaluation. The overall effect of knowledge network topology structure features is satisfactory, the distribution breadth of knowledge integration text content features has a greater effect on interdisciplinary evaluation, and the calculation effect is further improved by fitness weighted summation of each feature. The results demonstrate that the adaptive feature selection proposed in this paper can effectively screen the interdisciplinary related feature indexes, improve the reliability of the results, and achieve a comprehensive and in-depth measurement of the interdisciplinary of scientific research papers. This measure method avoids the subjective defects that may occur in qualitative evaluation and the problems that different measure indicators may produce contradictory results. It provides a new idea and direction for interdisciplinary measurement. © 2022 Institute of Cultural Heritage of the Academy of Sciences of Moldova. All rights reserved."
"Between 1987 and 2015, Terry Pratchett published eleven novels and one short story within his Discworld universe that came to be known as his “Witches” sub-series. In these texts he engaged with the narrative imperatives, preoccupations, and tropes which together make up the consensus fantasy universe, and those deeper mythologies and legendarium with which the author necessarily has an intertextual relationship. This paper focuses upon one aspect of that consensus universe, which is the difference between male and female magical practitioners—witches and wizards—in the fantasy canon, and how Pratchett sought to challenge and subvert the stereotypes of the genre in his own work. The primary means by which Pratchett achieved this, I have argued, is by exposing the fictionality of these stereotypes through parody and satire, whilst at the same time embedding these same tropes within his own universe as the building blocks of his secondary world. The period during which the “Witches” novels were produced is roughly commensurate with a timeframe in which the range of academic and activist positions which are broadly regarded as constituting second-wave feminism were giving rise to, being overtaken by (or in some cases were in direct conflict with) a multiplicity of newer scholarly approaches which have been described as comprising a third wave. Whilst it would be wrong-footed to attempt to position Pratchett’s ‘Witches” novels as a direct engagement with any of these theories, we can see in his writing an awareness of the shifting landscape of feminist thought, with themes in the earliest novels that take up ideas of equality of access similar to those that dominated first-wave discourse, as well as a growing cast of characters and range of thematic concerns that come to reflect the divergence of second and third-wave debates about biological sex and gender identity. Although Pratchett’s work does not itself constitute feminist scholarship, I have argued that through his engagement with some of the evolving ideas about women and their relative position in society, his “Witches” novels can be read as an attempt to change the way that women are portrayed in fantasy literature by intersecting with ideas that are external to it. In this respect, and by interpreting his work in terms of de Beauvoir’s archetypal stereotypes and her theory of Other, as well as Grosz’s work on feminine corporeality and Butler’s ideas of gender performativity, I have sought to illuminate how Pratchett’s fiction not only sits within a wider body of feminist discourse but can also bear the weight of such critical analysis. © 2023, The Mythopoeic Society.

"[Purpose/Significance] Literature classification is a fundamental task in library and information service, which is of great value for information resource management, and literature retrieval and acquisition. Deep learning-based literature classification methods are the current mainstream methods in text classification, which employ neural networks to model and use the textual content for literature classification. This approach only utilizes the information of the literature itself, but ignores the knowledge of the association between the literature. By observing the data, we found that literature in the same category tends to share more keyword information. The literature can build association networks through keywords to form structural relationships between literature. We attempt to utilize this structural in-formation to improve the performance of literature classification. [Methods/Process] This paper proposes a method that can model the structural representation of the literature and employ this representation to enhance traditional literature classification methods. Specifi-cally, we first constructed a large-scale keyword dictionary based on the collected data from about 930,000 documents. Second, we extracted the keyword set from the titles and abstracts of papers by a two-way maximum matching algorithm and constructed the keyword-literature graph data with the literature and keywords as nodes and the inclusion relationship between the documents and keywords as edges. The literature was connected with each other by keywords. Furthermore, we employed graph convolutional neural network to model the literature graph and learn the representation of literature and keywords in the keyword-literature graph. The literature representation generated by graph neural network contained the structural relationships between the literature. In addition, we employed Bert+BiLSTM to model the textual content representation of literature. Finally, the structural and textual representations of the literature were concatenated, and the classification of the literature was performed based on this representation. [Results/Conclusions] We constructed a literature classification dataset containing 423 classes and divided the training set, validation set and test set according to the ratio of 8:1:1. We conducted literature classification experiments on this dataset. The experimental results show that the structural information of literature can effectively enhance the performance of traditional literature classification methods. The results of the stripping experiments also show that the structural information alone is insufficient for the literature classification task. Through detailed analysis of the error data, we found that the model still has problems in handling some less frequent keywords and concepts. In the future, we plan to use small-sample learning methods to solve the classification problem for literature categories with less data. © Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

"An effective pain management strategy requires understanding of the epidemiology of pain in the population of interest and accurate measurement upon which to base quality improvement plans. The aims of this study were to estimate the incidence of pain in the prehospital setting and to explore features that impact on (1) documentation of pain; (2) severity of pain reported by patients. This retrospective cohort study included 212,401 care episodes attended by National Ambulance Service practitioners during 2020. Descriptive analysis of patient and care episode characteristics and regression analyses for the outcomes pain recorded and severity of pain were performed. We also used text pattern-matching of the notes field to estimate the proportion of patients in pain for whom a pain score assessment had not been documented. Sixty-five percent of all patients had a pain score documented and 29.5% were in pain (11% in severe pain). Likelihood of pain being recorded was most strongly associated with: Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Score, working diagnosis of the patient, location of the incident, and patient age. Likelihood of pain severity was most strongly associated with: transport status of patient, GCS score, and patient age. We treated missing data as a separate category and found consistent associations between the outcomes and missing data. We also found that pain was a symptom in approximately 15% of cases where no formal pain score assessment was documented. The data showed associations between routinely collected variables and the likelihood of pain recording and pain severity. Our findings also demonstrate the impact of missing data. To mitigate missing data impact, we suggest that EMS agencies consider making pain score assessment a mandatory requirement of their reporting for every patient. We also recommend that services report the extent and impact of missing data when measuring clinical performance. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Contrary to deconstruction and its destructive pursuit, the concept of undermining the familiar seeks to refute the constants and its known limitations. It is done through the process of receiving and what is imposed by the formation of the word or text or the structural and design structure in general, along with the Arabic calligraphy in particular. This is based on the recipient's understanding and interpretation of the dual phenomenon and the content's manifestation. More accurately, the disclosure of its reality through its expressive phenomenology; for that sake, the research was devoted to studying “undermining the familiar and embodiment content in Arabic calligraphy” including four chapters. The first chapter comprised the methodological introduction, the second chapter dealt with the concept of undermining the familiar and its representations in Arabic calligraphy, and to embodiment the content along with its use in Arabic calligraphy. While, the third chapter represented the research procedures and the community reached (32) compositions, in which the analysis concluded several results. The fourth chapter clarified the most important concept. The sample calligraphers were able to focus on the design relationships of the theoretical framework. The current study acquainted with undermining the familiar and embodiment of the content for those concerned and interested in the art of Arabic calligraphy, it also focused to benefit from the energies of letters and their constructive movements in building, modernizing, and renewing the arts of Arabic calligraphy. Moreover, the research also suggested studying the design treatments in order to embody the content in the formations of Arabic calligraphy. © The Authors."
"Objective: New Technologies and Innovative Solutions in creating a multimedia corpus of texts about the ""Mezen Robinsons"" aims to preserve the memory of an event that occurred in the 18th century and to study the history of Spitsbergen development. This article presents a multimedia corpus of Russian-language texts about the ""Mezen Robinsons"" written in 1766–2022. Observations show that the history of the survival of the Mezen hunters on Edge Island in 1743–1749 has repeatedly attracted the attention of specialists from various fields of knowledge: historians, archaeologists, publicists, professional writers, translators, etc. The corpus unites texts, audio, video, and multimedia resources. Methods: continuous sampling was used to collect the material; when analyzing and describing the data, we applied a descriptive method, a biographical method of studying literature, statistical data processing, philological analysis, observation, assessment, and corpus modeling methods. Findings: the methodology and technology of building an independent multimedia corpus, its architecture, and its design are described. Novelty: the multimedia corpus is a contribution to the development of a new approach to studying the subjectology of Russian literature. Practical significance: the findings can become the basis for studying the biographies and creativity of various authors who built their works on the plot of the Mezen industrialists and for further comparison of various interpretations of one event from the history of the development of the Arctic. © Authors retain all copyrights."
"A discourse containing one or more sentences describes daily issues and events for people to communicate their thoughts and opinions. As sentences are normally consist of multiple text segments, correct understanding of the theme of a discourse should take into consideration of the relations in between text segments. Although sometimes a connective exists in raw texts for conveying relations, it is more often the cases that no connective exists in between two text segments but some implicit relation does exist in between them. The task of implicit discourse relation recognition (IDRR) is to detect implicit relation and classify its sense between two text segments without a connective. Indeed, the IDRR task is important to diverse downstream natural language processing tasks, such as text summarization, machine translation and so on. This article provides a comprehensive and up-to-date survey for the IDRR task. We first summarize the task definition and data sources widely used in the field. We categorize the main solution approaches for the IDRR task from the viewpoint of its development history. In each solution category, we present and analyze the most representative methods, including their origins, ideas, strengths and weaknesses. We also present performance comparisons for those solutions experimented on a public corpus with standard data processing procedures. Finally, we discuss future research directions for discourse relation analysis.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery."
"Purpose: Searching, identifying and analysing the scientific literature on “corporate communication” published in scientific journals during the twenty-first century (2000–2021) and indexed in the Scopus database, as well as its possible relationship with COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic bibliographic search was carried out in Scopus and a subsequent analysis of the literature, based on variables such as year of publication, authorship, original language of the text, most used terms and concepts, journal titles, keywords and possible allusions to COVID-19 or the pandemic. Findings: 2023 results were initially identified, but after applying the filters that limited the results in time (2000–2021) and discriminated—according to the type of document—the results only to scientific articles, the sample finally analysed was 1,280 articles relating to “corporate communication”. It was found that these were mainly published in journals such as Corporate Communications and Journal of Communication Management, in English, and with an accentuated thematic dispersion, but mostly related to public relations, advertising and communication in general. Originality/value: There is an article published in 2012, before the COVID-19 pandemic, in the Italian journal Igiene e sanità publica, which already established the relevance of researching the challenges and solutions to communication risks in health crisis situations. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"COVID-19 has demonstrated the fragility of EU free movement rules when we are faced with an unknown virus of such magnitude and strength that it threatens our lives, health systems, economies and society. The aim of this text is to show the dynamics between the threat of COVID-19 and the rules imposed as a response to the pandemic, which have impacted the functioning of the EU internal market and the Schengen area. The text will concentrate on the application of the precautionary principle and public health restrictions, caused by COVID-19, to free movement of persons in the EU. The analysis will lead to three conclusions. First, it will be shown that the decisions to apply free movement restrictions and the logic followed in the EU COVID-19-related documents can be viewed as a triumph of the precautionary principle. Second, it will be argued that implementing the precautionary principle has a transformative effect on the application of the principle of proportionality in EU law. Finally, it will be shown that COVID-19 has emphasised and increased the difference between the conditions for the applicability of public health restrictions when compared to restrictions based on public policy and public security grounds.  © 2021 The Author(s)."
"With the rapid development of consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), aerial photographs from UAVs become a new source of data for destination image research, and provide support for the observation perspective from the ground to the sky. Taking Tibet as the research object, this study used UAV aerial photos, text profiles and location coordinates in the forum ""SkyPixel"", based on the ""cognitive-emotion"" model in destination image perception theory, applied computer vision analysis, social network analysis, computer text sentiment analysis and GIS spatial analysis to explore the perception of destination image in Tibet from the perspective of UAVs. The research results show that: The natural landscape accounts for the largest proportion of all visual cognitive images, and the majestic mountains and magnificent water features are the most prominent visual scenes of Tibet from the perspective of UAVs. The text profile of the photo is dominated by positive emotions, and the number of positive descriptions is far more than neutral and negative emotions. Negative emotions mainly come from the impact of difficult environments on shooting and self-driving. The overall image of Tibet is reflected in the magnificent plateau scenery and unique Tibetan architecture, specifically in four aspects: ""magnificent mountains and rivers"", ""holy waters"", ""plateau idyll"" and ""Tibetan architecture"", and the overall image perception is positive. The spatial distribution of the visual image reveals a pattern of ""One core and multi-segment areas"" distributed in ""east-west direction"". Finally, this study explored the ground-sky transition mechanism of Tibet destination visual image from four aspects: UAV photographer, UAV equipment, UAV perspective, destination visual marketing and construction, and put forward optimization suggestions for Tibet destination image construction based on the characteristics of environmental resources and UAVs. © 2023 Zhejiang University Press.

"Through intertextual analysis of ancient stone and metal images as well as written texts, this article explores the origins and identities of Tārā and Cundā, two Buddhist goddesses that are widely worshipped in the Indic and Tibetan Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna traditions. By charting the goddesses' iconographic characteristics, their quality, and their relationships with Avalokiteśvara, it argues that the prototype of Tārā is Yaśodharā-to-be, and that Cundā is based on Sujata, the girl who gave the Buddha-to-be milk rice. The first part of the analysis shows clear coherence throughout ancient visual narratives, namely images featuring the girl in the Dīpamkara Buddha story, images featuring Avalokiteśvara and Tārā, and independent images of Tārā. The second part demonstrates clear coherence in the evolution of the visual narratives, which feature Sujata holding a vessel to see the Buddha-to-be and independent Cundā images. The article also shows that the visual narratives have intrinsic fidelity. Copyright © 2023 The Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, Inc."
"The machine learning (ML) research community has landed on automated hate speech detection as the vital tool in the mitigation of bad behavior online. However, it is not clear that this is a widely supported view outside of the ML world. Such a disconnect can have implications for whether automated detection tools are accepted or adopted. Here we lend insight into how other key stakeholders understand the challenge of addressing hate speech and the role automated detection plays in solving it. To do so, we develop and apply a structured approach to dissecting the discourses used by online platform companies, governments, and not-for-profit organizations when discussing hate speech. We find that, where hate speech mitigation is concerned, there is a profound disconnect between the computer science research community and other stakeholder groups—which puts progress on this important problem at serious risk. We identify urgent steps that need to be taken to incorporate computational researchers into a single, coherent, multistakeholder community that is working towards civil discourse online.

"Importance: Many clinical trial outcomes are documented in free-text electronic health records (EHRs), making manual data collection costly and infeasible at scale. Natural language processing (NLP) is a promising approach for measuring such outcomes efficiently, but ignoring NLP-related misclassification may lead to underpowered studies. Objective: To evaluate the performance, feasibility, and power implications of using NLP to measure the primary outcome of EHR-documented goals-of-care discussions in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial of a communication intervention. Design, Setting, and Participants: This diagnostic study compared the performance, feasibility, and power implications of measuring EHR-documented goals-of-care discussions using 3 approaches: (1) deep-learning NLP, (2) NLP-screened human abstraction (manual verification of NLP-positive records), and (3) conventional manual abstraction. The study included hospitalized patients aged 55 years or older with serious illness enrolled between April 23, 2020, and March 26, 2021, in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial of a communication intervention in a multihospital US academic health system. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes were natural language processing performance characteristics, human abstractor-hours, and misclassification-adjusted statistical power of methods of measuring clinician-documented goals-of-care discussions. Performance of NLP was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and precision-recall (PR) analyses and examined the effects of misclassification on power using mathematical substitution and Monte Carlo simulation. Results: A total of 2512 trial participants (mean [SD] age, 71.7 [10.8] years; 1456 [58%] female) amassed 44324 clinical notes during 30-day follow-up. In a validation sample of 159 participants, deep-learning NLP trained on a separate training data set from identified patients with documented goals-of-care discussions with moderate accuracy (maximal F1score, 0.82; area under the ROC curve,0.924; area under the PR curve, 0.879). Manual abstraction of the outcome from the trial data set would require an estimated 2000 abstractor-hours and would power the trial to detect a risk difference of 5.4% (assuming 33.5% control-arm prevalence, 80% power, and 2-sided α =.05). Measuring the outcome by NLP alone would power the trial to detect a risk difference of 7.6%. Measuring the outcome by NLP-screened human abstraction would require 34.3 abstractor-hours to achieve estimated sensitivity of 92.6% and would power the trial to detect a risk difference of 5.7%. Monte Carlo simulations corroborated misclassification-adjusted power calculations. Conclusions and Relevance: In this diagnostic study, deep-learning NLP and NLP-screened human abstraction had favorable characteristics for measuring an EHR outcome at scale. Adjusted power calculations accurately quantified power loss from NLP-related misclassification, suggesting that incorporation of this approach into the design of studies using NLP would be beneficial.. © 2023 American Medical Association.

"The literature of documentary ethics began to emerge in the West during the 1970s. If one carefully studies documentary films on Taiwan’s indigenous peoples, which have been the subject for over a hundred years, from the perspective of documentary ethics, then there are probably many films worth discussing. However, only the 2007 documentary “Honey Peach Grandma” provides more discussion on documentary ethics. When the documentaries “Turning 18” in 2019 and “The Way Home” in 2020 were released, they caused many protests from young indigenous people regarding the ethical issues raised in these two films, but received scant attention. Therefore, this research specifically discusses these two films from the perspective of documentary ethics. It should be emphasized that the ethical controversy of representing indigenous peoples in documentaries can occur regardless of whether the author(s) are indigenous or non-indigenous. This essay chooses these two films, not because of the ethnicity of the authors, but because these two films caused controversy that did not receive enough attention. The main focus of this study is to analyze whether the subjects’ right to informed consent was properly exercised in two documentary films. Could the subjects potentially be harmed by the screening of the films? Did the content of the documentaries lack relevant historical context, thereby making it apolitical? What kind of impact could the screening of these films have on the audience and the subjects? This study transcribes every scene of the two films into text to establish the films’ structure. Additionally, relevant media reports, personal statements, and discussions from social media related to the ethics of the documentaries are collected and compared for analysis of the films. Furthermore, young people who were involved in the filming process of the documentary “The Way Home” were interviewed to gain insights into the documentary filmmakers’ contact with the protesting family, the shooting process, and the family’s reactions after the film premiere. This study finds that both films are controversial in terms of the informed consent of the subjects. In “Turning 18”, it is worth investigating whether the subjects had the legal capacity to consent to being filmed during the shooting period, and whether they were capable of understanding the potential impact of the film’s exposure. In “The Way Home”, the tribe and some of its members who were filmed were never given the opportunity to exercise their right to informed consent, and they were already filmed and included in the film as an important element of the plot. Additionally, when the members refused to be filmed or expressed different opinions on the story, the documentary filmmaker seemed to have ignored their requests. In terms of the historical context, both films fail to fully present the complex context behind the difficult situations faced by the subjects. The main focus of both films is to create an aesthetic, poetic, or humorous style of sound and image that make the viewers be moved and to sympathize with the subjects. The political nature of these films originally should have had been erased. The lack of historical context has far-reaching consequences. In terms of stereotypes, “Turning 18” replicates common stereotypes of indigenous peoples such as heavy drinking, poverty, backwardness, and overly optimism, but fails to help the audience understand the reasons behind these stereotypes. This may lead viewers to confirm that indigenous peoples can be described with simplified characteristics and are “others” who are somewhat different from the audience’s own ethnic group. In terms of spectacle, both films successfully depict the overly optimistic indigenous peoples when facing stunningly difficult situations, but fail to prompt viewers to think deeply about the reasons why indigenous peoples have fallen into such difficult situations. This prompts both films to serve as dazzling spectacles and visual consumer goods. The lives of the subjects in “Turning 18” are not too far from their perceptions, while the story created in “The Way Home” deviates to some extent from the perceptions of some of the subjects due to the lack of family historical context, insufficient field investigation, and distorted on-site event contexts. This type of inspiring spectacle may not help viewers understand Paiwan culture, but instead may mislead them and may create negative impressions of such culture. Regarding the harm caused to the subjects after the screening, “Turning 18” provides insufficient protection for the two girls and their families, making it easy for them to be identified. This may result in negative discussions and criticism of the film’s content for many years. “The Way Home” has caused great distress to Gao Yujin and her family, who even resorted to legal action to protest against the film. Documentary filmmakers can return to their original lives safely after filming and screening, but if they do not handle the film properly, then those who appear in the film with their true identities and faces may have to live with the impact and harm brought by the film for the rest of their lives. This study suggests that when documentary filmmakers are shooting films with the difficult situation of Indigenous peoples as the main theme, they should conduct detailed field investigations and literature research, interview those who are being filmed, and respect their opinions. Filmmakers should try to present a detailed family history context or a larger historical, political, and economic context. Before shooting, those who are being filmed should exercise their right to informed consent. If the person being filmed decides not to participate, then the filmmaker should stop filming and delete any relevant footage. If the person being filmed agrees to participate, then the filmmaker should do one’s best to provide adequate protection and minimize the impact on the subject’s future lives. Regardless of whether filmmakers are Indigenous persons or not, they need to invest more time and energy to understand the unique culture and complex history behind the stories of those who are being filmed in order to produce works that respect Indigenous people and their views as well as avoid creating works that are apolitical due to the lack of historical context. © 2023 National Chengchi University.

"PURPOSE The purpose of this study was to understand the current market trend for golf apparel rental services and to present basic data to revitalize the golf apparel rental service market and prepare continuous growth plans. METHODS The following keywords were selected for data collection: ""golf wear + rental (렌탈),"" ""golf wear + rental (대여),"" ""golf apparel + rental (렌탈),"" and ""golf apparel + rental (대여).“ The analysis period was limited to two years and seven months from January 1, 2020 to July 31, 2022, when COVID-19 began. The analysis was focused on the top 60 keywords to simplify the network. RESULTS Various keywords were extracted through text mining, TF-IDF, connection centrality, emotional analysis, and semantic network analysis of big data analysis. These were then categorized into four factors: “golf apparel rental service,” “self-expression and authentication,” “sharing economy,” and “emotion.” CONCLUSIONS The results of this study show that young golfers are unreluctant and are generally positive in renting golf apparel. Therefore, if the growing paradigm of the consumption behavior of MZ-generation golfers is recognized and analyzed and the requirements are continuously satisfied through various strategies, there will be a higher possibility to help expand the golf apparel rental market. © Korea Institute of Sport Science."
"The twentieth century was a prolific period in the appearance of different models for the construction of states. Proposals were put forward across disciplines such as politics, economics, philosophy and religion. In the political sphere, during the pre-Internet era of mass media, the discourse was one of the main channels for the transmission of ideas. As a result, speeches are nowadays a multifaceted source for research. José Antonio Primo de Rivera was a productive author who left numerous texts. Primo de Rivera's discourse evolved from initial conservatism to an attempt to appeal to the working class with left-wing rhetoric. His staging proposed to transcend the traditional concepts of right and left in order to bring together followers from across the political spectrum. In this research, we use computer tools to analyse the model of state proposed by José Antonio Primo de Rivera through his speeches as well as his relationship with other concepts widely used in his rallies and articles. This analysis of the Falangist leader allows us to identify the fundamental elements of the system he intended to establish. We also corroborate the sources of the discourse and demonstrate some of the particularities of José Antonio's thought through the proposed computer methodology. © 2023 Universidad Pompeu Fabra.

"PURPOSE This study aims to critically read the film <Run-Off 2> in a manner in which its narrative represents and constructs the multicultural subject as the fearful and compassionate “other,” and its structure and meanings reconciles with the concept of cultural citizenship. METHODS This research is informed by two methods: 1) text analysis by deconstructing the narrative structure and flow, and 2) contextual interpretation focussing on understanding the significance of the filmic representation in the Korean historical, political, social, and cultural contexts. RESULTS The narrative of the film portrays and constructs the multicultural subject as a cultural other, with specific styles of representation, in which stereotypical description, otherizing tropes of double process, and recognition struggle for cultural citizenship. CONCLUSIONS The study summarized the present research and laid out some suggestions for critical studies of sport films from an interdisciplinary approach and cultural studies-based methods. © Korea Institute of Sport Science."
"Transitioning from block-based programming environments to text-based programming environments can be challenging as it requires students to learn new programming language concepts. In this paper, we identify and classify the issues encountered when transitioning from block-based to text-based programming. In particular, we investigate differences that emerge in learners when using a structured editor compared to an unstructured editor. We followed 26 high school students (ages 12-16; M=14 years) as they transitioned from Scratch to Python in three phases: (i) learning Scratch, (ii) transitioning from Scratch to Python using either a structured or unstructured editor, and (iii) evaluating Python coding skills using an unstructured editor. We identify 27 distinct types of issues and show that learners who used a structured editor during the transition phase had 4.6x less syntax issues and 1.9x less data-type issues compared to those who did not. When these learners switched to an unstructured editor for evaluation, they kept a lower rate on data-type issues but faced 4x more syntax errors. © 2023 ACM."
"Background: Missed nursing care (MNC) is experienced in nearly all healthcare facilities. Awareness of the aspects involved in the MNC can improve the quality of patient care. The objective of this systematic review is to provide insights into the factors that contribute to the occurrence of MNC. Methods: The review will adhere to the 2020 preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement and includes studies published in peer-reviewed journals from 2012 to 2022. The databases used in the literature search include ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library, PubMed, ProQuest, and the Wiley Online Library. The eligibility criteria were determined based on population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and study (PICOS) guidelines. To evaluate the quality of the studies, the NIH quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross-sectional studies was employed, while the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane collaboration’s risk of bias tool. Three authors independently performed data extraction using qualitative analysis and reached a final agreement. Results: A total of 3611 articles were found in the database search. After removing duplicates and ineligible articles, review studies, case reports, letters to editors, incomplete texts, dissertations, and book chapters, 16 articles were finally eligible for further analysis. In general, there were three categories of factors related to MNC, including labor resources (workload, staff adequacy, staff characteristics, nurse-patient ratio, shift work, and nurse job satisfaction), material sources (work environment, personal protective equipment, patient care equipment), and teamwork and communication (communication within nursing team, and communication with medical staff). The most common influencing factor seemed to be staffing adequacy. Conclusion: The role of healthcare service management and leadership is central to mitigating the factors contributing to MNCs’ emergence, especially labor resources. Meta-analytic studies are needed to find the most influential factors of MNC based on the results of all available studies. © 2023 Kohat University of Science and Technology. All rights reserved."
"Introduction The burden of disease attributed to drinking water from private wells is not well characterised. The Wells and Enteric disease Transmission trial is the first randomised controlled trial to estimate the burden of disease that can be attributed to the consumption of untreated private well water. To estimate the attributable incidence of gastrointestinal illness (GI) associated with private well water, we will test if the household treatment of well water by ultraviolet light (active UV device) versus sham (inactive UV device) decreases the incidence of GI in children under 5 years of age. Methods and analysis The trial will enrol (on a rolling basis) 908 families in Pennsylvania, USA, that rely on private wells and have a child 3 years old or younger. Participating families are randomised to either an active whole-house UV device or a sham device. During follow-up, families will respond to weekly text messages to report the presence of signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal or respiratory illness and will be directed to an illness questionnaire when signs/symptoms are present. These data will be used to compare the incidence of waterborne illness between the two study groups. A randomly selected subcohort submits untreated well water samples and biological specimens (stool and saliva) from the participating child in both the presence and absence of signs/symptoms. Samples are analysed for the presence of common waterborne pathogens (stool and water) or immunoconversion to these pathogens (saliva). Ethics Approval has been obtained from Temple University's Institutional Review Board (Protocol 25665). The results of the trial will be published in peer-reviewed journals.

"This study investigates how Taiwan Indigenous Television’s news represents indigenous people’s traditional knowledge, explains the relationship between climate events and indigenous cultures, and further explores the intention of cultural dissemination. The results herein can promote communication, education, and news content design in regards to the indigenous culture. It first presents a literature review to examine the impact of climate change on indigenous culture, to clarify the concepts of and interactions between indigenous people’s traditional knowledge and resilience, and to evaluate their power relationships in their discourse on climate change. Discussions covering the influence of climate change on indigenous people has shifted focus from the tangible loss involved in climate change to the non-economic or spiritual aspects of influence. However, discourse on climate change has not appeared in the context of indigenous people’s traditional knowledge (e.g., local legends, rituals, and socioecological knowledge). Traditional knowledge is qualitative-, subjective-, and experience-based and emphasizes contextualized micro-narratives of the locals as opposed to scientific knowledge, which can be explained through quantitative, empirical, rational, and predictable grand narratives. This does not negate the applicability of ethnic-, culture-, and spirit-centered traditional knowledge of an indigenous group to other indigenous groups; rather, intergroup exchanges occur, because of similar sociocultural and ecological conditions. The resilience and recovery processes of indigenous people are collective, and their traditional knowledge is tightly connected through their worldview of relationships. As news related to climate change transitions from scientifically-focused toward more socially- and culturally-focused content, the discourse on disaster management and environmental vulnerability has mainly responded to the dominant political, economic, cultural, and social groups as well as their values. Therefore, indigenous people’s cultural experiences are often overlooked. This study conducts a narrative analysis by retrieving documents from the Taiwan Indigenous Television channel. It collects news reports from 2011 to 2021 by searching keywords such as “climate change” and “global warming.” Similarity analysis principles allows us to select climate events that affect indigenous people and have features distinct from others. By rereading and retelling, it analyzes texts for background, sources, routes, resources, perspectives, cultural identity, and members involved to explore the timing, purpose, meaning, and symbolism of representing indigenous people’s traditional knowledge. In the text analysis, 82 news reports are selected and categorized under 4 cultural frameworks according to similarities of their content for the narrative analysis. The 4 frameworks are ecological signals, open indigenous tribes, resilient relationships, and intercultural others frameworks. The analysis results are as follows. (1) The ecological signals framework represents “traditional normality.” Indigenous people regard ecological signals as critical cultural events. The presence of abnormal signals indicates that other activities will be affected and that corresponding actions are required. If the news audience lacks understanding of the cultural background and interpretation associated with the animals, plants, and the environment mentioned in news, they may fail to develop a deeper cultural understanding (e.g., of rituals and myths). (2) The open tribes framework connects the identities of indigenous peoples. Discussions on climate change involve an examination of one another’s tribal cultures (e.g., in seminars, forums, workshops, and award ceremonies). The open tribes framework produces understanding and value recognition and introduces traditional knowledge to the outside world. The audience’s lack of exchange with and understanding of other indigenous tribes and its unawareness of the actions taken by other tribes may impose challenges in that the audience may interpret the news content through their local context (e.g., the elders, memories, and myths of their own tribes). (3) The resilient relationships framework focuses on events related to relational ethics. Narratives revolve around the living space of tribes (e.g., fishing, construction, crop farming, and livestock farming). The study examines existing resilient relationships in a meaningful environment to obtain knowledge for generating dynamic resilience. The resilient relationships framework provides a dynamic interpretation of indigenous people’s resilience through both traditional and modern knowledge. (4) The intercultural others framework explains how indigenous peoples worldwide share their traditional knowledge, fight for their cultural rights in protection of their tight relationships with nature and the land, respond to interactions between the continuation of traditional knowledge and external forces (e.g., globalization, business markets, and systemic environmental threats), and handle the power relationships involved in the interactions. This framework emphasizes the connection of cultural actions taken by indigenous people around the world in response to climate change. The resilient actions of indigenous people maintain the unique cultural boundaries of tribes in which similar beliefs and values are shared with changes to the traditional territorial behavior. Traditions are continued to retain tribal identity and accentuate the inclusivity of tribal culture. The news produced by Taiwan Indigenous Television is typically based on cultural topics, and the narratives closely relate to the traditional knowledge of indigenous people. Although a single piece of news cannot present the entire picture of Taiwan’s indigenous peoples, their traditional knowledge may be scattered across various news texts. In the overall cultural context, indices can be created to connect related news texts to reveal how an event is culturally unique to each indigenous group. These texts could be utilized as materials for cultural dissemination, education, and design (e.g., art creations and development of teaching materials), which can shape and mediatize the indigenous knowledge system for various purposes. Taiwan Indigenous Television demonstrates the diversity of media culture in climate change topics. The production of indigenous people’s traditional knowledge is not limited to compiling ancient texts, as it provides a basis for reflecting how cultural texts are produced in other media. Building upon the narratives under the 4 frameworks, indigenous people and reporters can, with both of them being a subject of the narrative, collaborate to produce and apply traditional knowledge as they situate themselves in the present while looking back on ancient memories. By asking themselves whose traditional knowledge they are discussing, they can produce in-depth experimental narratives that are relevant to resilience and culturally responsive to climate change (or sustainability). © 2023 National Chengchi University.

"Memristors, emerging non-volatile memory devices, have shown promising potential in neuromorphic hardware designs, especially in spiking neural network (SNN) hardware implementation. Memristor-based SNNs have been successfully applied in a wide range of applications, including image classification and pattern recognition. However, implementing memristor-based SNNs in text classification is still under exploration. One of the main reasons is that training memristor-based SNNs for text classification is costly due to the lack of efficient learning rules and memristor non-idealities. To address these issues and accelerate the research of exploring memristor-based SNNs in text classification applications, we develop a simulation framework with a virtual memristor array using an empirical memristor model. We use this framework to demonstrate a sentiment analysis task in the IMDB movie reviews dataset. We take two approaches to obtain trained SNNs with memristor models: (1) by converting a pre-trained artificial neural network (ANN) to a memristor-based SNN, or (2) by training a memristor-based SNN directly. These two approaches can be applied in two scenarios: offline classification and online training. We achieve the classification accuracy of 85.88% by converting a pre-trained ANN to a memristor-based SNN and 84.86% by training the memristor-based SNN directly, given that the baseline training accuracy of the equivalent ANN is 86.02%. We conclude that it is possible to achieve similar classification accuracy in simulation from ANNs to SNNs and from non-memristive synapses to data-driven memristive synapses. We also investigate how global parameters such as spike train length, the read noise, and the weight updating stop conditions affect the neural networks in both approaches. This investigation further indicates that the simulation using statistic memristor models in the two approaches presented by this paper can assist the exploration of memristor-based SNNs in natural language processing tasks. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Many birthday greeting cards not only mention a specific age, such as 30, 40, 50 and so on, but they also express attitudes towards particular ages, either directly or indirectly, in their texts. Past has looked at attitudes towards aging and ageism in birthday cards. However, there is a lack of recent scholarship employing a detailed linguistic analysis of the texts of age-related birthday cards and implied attitudes and ideologies. The purpose of this study was to take a closer look at English language textual discourses in a popular cultural genre, online birthday greeting cards, and how they construct attitudes and ideologies of age in contemporary Western society. The data sample consists of the texts of ten birthday cards for each of ten different ages, ranging from five years to one hundred years, for a total of 100 cards. The cards were obtained from the online websites of two greeting card companies in the United States. The methodology involves a qualitative discourse analysis that examines specific linguistic devices in the texts. The results of this analysis confirm the presence of negative attitudes towards every age group except the two youngest ones (five years old and twenty-one years old). Moreover, even though these two groups were portrayed in a more positive light than the others, there were also age-related stereotypes in many of the cards for these two age categories. This study contributes to the research on aging and ageism, age stereotyping in greeting cards and the field of discourse analysis in an online modality. © Peter Lang Group AG, International Academic Publishers, Bern 2023.

"Acute burn surgery has long been associated with significant intra-operative bleeding. Several techniques were introduced to limit hemorrhage, including tourniquets, tumescent infiltration, and topical agents. To date, no study has comprehensively investigated the available data regarding topical hemostatic agents in burn surgery. A systematic review was performed by two independent reviewers using electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) from first available to September 10, 2021. Articles were included if they were published in English and described or evaluated topical hemostatic agents used in burn excision and/or grafting. Data were extracted on the agent(s) used, their dosage, mode of delivery, hemostasis outcomes, and complications. The search identified 1982 nonduplicate citations, of which 134 underwent full-text review, and 49 met inclusion criteria. In total, 32 studies incorporated a vasoconstrictor agent, and 28 studies incorporated a procoagulant agent. Four studies incorporated other agents (hydrogen peroxide, tranexamic acid, collagen sheets, and TT-173). The most common vasoconstrictor used was epinephrine, with doses ranging from 1:1000 to 1:1,000,000. The most common procoagulant used was thrombin, with doses ranging from 10 to 1000 IU/ml. Among the comparative studies, outcomes of blood loss were not reported in a consistent manner, therefore meta-analysis could not be performed. The majority of studies (94%) were level of evidence III-V. Determining the optimal topical hemostatic agent is limited by low-quality data and challenges with consistent reporting of intra-operative blood loss. Given the routine use of topical hemostatic agents in burn surgery, high-quality research is essential to determine the optimal agent, dosage, and mode of delivery. © The Author(s) 2022.

"The rapid adoption of online social media platforms has transformed the way of communication and interaction. On these platforms, discussions in the form of trending topics provide a glimpse of events happening around the world in real-time. Also, these trends are used for political campaigns, public awareness, and brand promotions. Consequently, these trends are sensitive to manipulation by malicious users who aim to mislead the mass audience. In this article, we identify and study the characteristics of users involved in the manipulation of Twitter trends in Pakistan. We propose 'Manipify'-a framework for automatic detection and analysis of malicious users in Twitter trends. Our framework consists of three distinct modules: (1) user classifier, (2) hashtag classifier, and (3) trend analyzer. The user classifier module introduces a novel approach to automatically detect manipulators using tweet content and user behaviour features. Also, the module classifies human and bot users. Next, the hashtag classifier categorizes trending hashtags into six categories assisting in examining manipulators behaviour across different categories. Finally, the trend analyzer module examines users, hashtags, and tweets for hashtag reach, linguistic features, and user behaviour. Our user classifier module achieves 0.92 and 0.98 accuracy in classifying manipulators and bots, respectively. We further test Manipify on the dataset comprising 652 trending hashtags with 5.4 million tweets and 1.9 million users. The analysis of trends reveals that the trending panel is mostly dominated by political hashtags. In addition, our results show a higher contribution of human accounts in trend manipulation as compared to bots.  © 2020 Tsinghua University Press."
"Whether Marx's economics and Marxist political economy can be formalized using mathematics is a controversial and divisive issue. From studying the text of Capital and its manuscripts, it emerges that Marx's research on the capitalist mode of production involves the application of mathematical methods. Marx creates a set of symbols related to the social production of capitalism, and on that basis constructs an economic model corresponding to his theoretical analysis. Obviously, the mathematical method is an integral part of Marx's economic methodology. In a certain sense, using mathematical methods to study and formalize Marx's economics is in line with Marx's approach to economic topics. However, the formalization of Marx's economics must strictly observe the relevant principles; otherwise, it will lead to serious problems. © 2023 Pluto Journals. All rights reserved."
"First, some electoral processes and then the COVID-19 crisis have brought offensive and dangerous disinformation events in social media into the spotlight. This research analyses an event concerning disinformation and the launch and dissemination of the hashtag #ExposeBillGates, through the 183,016 tweets that used this hashtag during its period of activity in June 2020. Through network analysis and by processing the content of the messages through text mining, it was observed that the size of the event was highly dependent on the participation of a small number of accounts, and some violent and abusive communication was found, although not hate speech. The need to deeply study the relationship between two macro communicative phenomena of a different nature, but more intertwined in their “problematic” origin than may appear, is discussed. © 2023 Revista de los Estudios de Derecho y Ciencia Política.

"The text engages with the ongoing discussion about the role played by religion in social life, with attention paid to transnational dynamics of religiosity in migrants’ individual experiences, expectations and modes of involvement. We concentrate on the research problem: how does the Roman Catholic Church, through the networks of the faithful, facilitate, challenge, and intersect with the adaptation or integration of migrants in their new settings? The study draws on a survey conducted with a sample (n = 620) Polish Catholics in Great Britain in 2019. With the cluster analysis, we distinguished five categories of participants in parish life. The results of the study concern the declared expectations of the respondents in the confessional and non-confessional (charity, leisure, tourist, or cultural) activities. It shows two paths of respondents’ religious experience: the old parochialism and the new one. The first attitude, represents a general religious-community context, while the second one emphasizes socio-cultural background and cooperative style of work based on associations and goals-achievement. Our findings concern the socio-cultural specificity of migrants resulting from belonging to migrant parishes outside Poland and how this specificity can be juxtaposed with information concerning mainstream Catholic parishes in Great Britain. © Religious Research Association 2023."
"PURPOSE: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often recommended as opioid-sparing agents. The objective of this scoping review was to conduct a thorough search of the current literature to determine whether in adult critically ill patients there is an association between exposure to NSAIDs vs no NSAIDs and the subsequent development of serious adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal bleeding and acute kidney injury (AKI). METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews was utilized as a guideline for reporting. Searches were performed in PubMed (National Library of Medicine), Cochrane Library (Wiley), EMBASE (Elsevier), Stat!Ref (Teton), and Access Pharmacy (McGraw Hill) for articles published from January 2016 to August 2022. RESULTS: Of the 3,062 citations and titles identified in the search, 2,737 titles remained after removal of duplicates, 2,588 were excluded at title and abstract screening, and 149 articles remained for full-text review. None of the studies involved heterogeneous groups of critically ill patients in nonspecialty intensive care unit settings. Most studies evaluated were conducted in the perioperative setting and had limited adverse events reporting, particularly with respect to serious NSAID-related adverse effects of concern in critically ill patients. CONCLUSION: In published studies primarily involving perioperative patients, there is insufficient detail concerning the definitions and reporting of NSAID-related serious adverse events such as bleeding and AKI. These events are of particular concern in heterogeneous critically ill patient populations predisposed to such complications. In most (if not all) critically ill patients, sustained dosing of NSAIDs should be avoided regardless of COX-1 selectivity due to the paucity of safety data. © American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2022.

"Objective To analyze the information related to child‑prohibition in drug labels in China. Methods The existing drug labels for chemical drugs and biological products included in the China Pharmacopoeia 2020 (Ch. P) were collected through searching websites such as ""Yaozhiwang"" ""Dingxiangyuan"" and ""Yimaitong"", and information related to child‑prohibition was extracted. The expres‑ sion and existing problems of information about child‑prohibition were analyzed. Results A total of 1 741 and 149 chemical and biological products were included in the Ch.P, respectively, of which 411 (23.6%) and 6 (4.0%) products involved information of child‑prohibition. Information of child‑prohibition was expressed in 18 ways, such as ""prohibited"" ""not recommended"" and ""try not to"", etc. Issues of child‑prohibition infor‑ mation in drug labels of the same drug from different manufacturers were inconsistent text descriptions, inconsistent age range, and incomplete information on whether there was benzyl alcohol; issues in the same drug label was different age ranges for child-prohibition in different chapters. Conclusions There are inconsistencies and non‑standard issues in information related to child-prohibition in the existing drug instructions in China. Drug manufacturers should conduct full lifecycle management of drug labels in accor‑ dance with the ""Technical Guidelines for Writing Information on Children′s Medication in the Instructions of Chemical Drugs and Therapeutic Biological Products (trial)"", and continuously standardize and improve the information of child-prohibition. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"The space is considered as a significant element per se. It can give us light about ethos, insomuch as the human existence expresses itself spatially. Our purpose is to describe the characteristics that space has in the poetry of Fabio Morábito in order to show how the lived space exhibit ways of life, shortly, a certain ethos. The analysis of the text follows some tensive semiotics principles. It is found that, in Fabio Morábito’s poetry there is a predilection for open spaces. The figures of virgin terrain or waste lot mean values such as distention, the inchoative, the inconclusive, the open identity. In synthesis, the openness expresses a certain way of living associated with the uprootedness. It is concluded that the amplitude and the openness, favor the intelligible, thus the subject has a greater judgment capacity. © 2023 Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata. All rights reserved."
"Algorithms designed to translate textual content into sign language (SL) expressed through avatars have been used to reduce accessibility barriers. Our research aimed to identify whether the VLibras tool, widely adopted on Brazilian government websites, is an effective accessibility solution for automatic translation into SL. It is an exploratory and applied qualitative research project involving a bibliographic review and support from expert interpreters. We conducted two experimental studies using sequential chronological cuts and applying prescriptive and semantic analyses. We present evidence that there is no actual translation into SL in the automatic translation process performed by the VLibras translation algorithm (TA) but only a transposition of part of the SL lexicon to the Portuguese morphosyntactic structure. The automatic translation of long texts and texts with complex syntactic structures results in excessive pauses and dactylology for words that have a sign registered in the basic SL dictionary. Using human–computer interaction concepts to evaluate automatic translation into sign language by the VLibras TA expands the existing theoretical discussion. It also contributes to minimizing communication problems caused by the discrepancy between the original message and the machine translation, a practical applicability of this study. © The Author(s) 2022.

"This article focuses on issues related to risk assessment when maneuvering a loaded bulk carrier in close proximity to a vessel performing underwater work at the time. It is based on a detailed analysis of an incident that took place in the Gulf of Gdansk. The write-up explains real turns of events, conditions and factors that contributed to the incident, but also its consequences are explained. Some other aspects of this article focuses on, are the processes of examination of the direct causes of the incident and identification not compliance with regulations, requirements, or procedures that help to find out the human, technical, and organizational errors. The authors of this text indicate the safety guards that have failed, give the reasons for their failure and, where it was possible, point out the safety guards that should or must be established. The article does not take into account theoretical models for the described accidents, but only practical aspects, human errors and applicable local and international laws and regulations. Particular attention was devoted to the analysis of human errors made by officers maneuvering the surface vessel in the close vicinity of divers performing underwater works. © 2023, Faculty of Navigation, Gdynia Maritime University.

"This sophisticated and empathetic study explores a suite of important Australian literary works from the Chinese diaspora. Using memory studies to trace connections and contiguities, Dr Chen maps an emotionally charged literary network that is compelled by the past to confront the future. The result is a richly revealing exploration of transnational literary identity and complex forms of belonging and attachment across time and place. (Professor Nicole Moore, UNSW Canberra) If memory is the broken mirror of history, diasporic memories are intricate mosaics of multitudinous pasts: personal, collective, national, cosmopolitan, cultural and political. Reading Chinese Australian literature as a mimesis of memory, Beibei Chen offers invaluable insights into the entanglement of past and present and its effect on diasporic identity. (Professor Wenche Ommundsen, University of Wollongong) Inspired by the transnational turn in global literature, this book explores the significance of transnational memory and identity in Chinese-Australian literature by closely examining representations of these two concepts in selected texts. By attending to diverse forms of memory such as collective memory, individual memory, cosmopolitan memory and transgenerational memory, this book offers unique observations on how different types of memory exert influence on the formation of identity in Chinese diasporic writings and tackles the complexity of reading literary texts in light of theories of memory, sociological studies and psychological analysis. © Peter Lang Group AG 2023.

"The use of history textbooks in order to instill particular images of the nation and national identity has been widely recognized, with a proliferation of studies focused on the problematic content in textbooks. Yet, history textbooks rely on a range of other media like maps, graphs, illustrated timelines, and photographs, which also play an important role in visually signposting the nation. While some of these images serve primarily as a form of representation aligned with the text itself, other aspects of visual content distinctly and autonomously construct national identity. In this piece, relying on qualitative visual analysis, we point to the function played by images in symbolically constructing the nation in contemporary primary school textbooks in five post-Yugoslav republics, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia. © 2023, Berghahn Journals.

"Researchers working with administrative crime data often must classify offense narratives into a common scheme for analysis purposes. No comprehensive standard currently exists, nor is there a mapping tool to transform raw descriptions into offense types. This paper introduces a new schema, the Uniform Crime Classification Standard (UCCS), and the Text-based Offense Classification (TOC) tool to address these shortcomings. The UCCS schema draws from existing efforts, aiming to better reflect offense severity and improve type disambiguation. The TOC tool is a machine learning algorithm that uses a hierarchical, multilayer perceptron classification framework, built on 313,209 hand-coded offense descriptions from 24 states, to translate raw descriptions into UCCS codes. We test how variations in data processing and modeling approaches affect recall, precision, and F1 scores to assess their relative influence on model performance. The code scheme and classification tool are collaborations between Measures for Justice and the Criminal Justice Administrative Records System. Copyright © 2023 The Authors, some rights reserved;"
"It analyzes the editorials of the Peruvian newspaper La República published from May 5 to June 6, 2021, dates in which the political campaigns for the second round of elections for the presidency of Peru took place. The aim is to discover relevant information to understand the use of the terminologies communicated through the written language in that newspaper. Using the text mining technique and machine learning algorithms for the analysis of unstructured data, a dendrogram and clusters were created to validate and estimate the groupings of the most frequent terms. In relation to each candidate, the regression analysis shows a differentiated association in the use of words. These words form a network that expresses the political conjuncture of the period under study and is reinforced by the construction of a cloud of words with the highest frequency of use. It is concluded that the media construct their own social representations on various local and national issues in a way that consciously or unconsciously evidences their preferences. These preferences are not foreign in the editorials of the newspaper La República. The importance of conducting this type of study lies in the potential of the theory of social representations to place the researcher in front of the position held by the subjects, who construct and communicate the antagonistic onslaughts of the national social reality. © 2023 University of Piura.

"This paper presents pieces of evidence of the use of Politeness Strategies and Face threateningActs in dialogues between characters in two drama texts: Death and the King’s Horseman by Wole Soyinka, a Nigerian author (text A) and Othello by William Shakespeare, an English author (text B). This research analyses the relationship between Pilkings, Amusa and Joseph in Death and the King’s Horseman and the relationship between Othello and Iago in Othello. The analysis utilisesthe politeness theory by Brown and Levinson (1978 and 1987) which revolves around the concept of face by Erving Goffman(1967). The thrust of thistheory is to minimise conflict and foster harmony in social interaction. In order to answer the following questions, the data werepurposively selected and qualitative research design is utilized: Do the speeches in the texts satisfy the principle of politeness? What kind of meaning interpretation is depicted in these drama texts? How has speech been used to show the kind of relationship that exists between these characters? It was discovered that while Amusa is utilising negative strategy, Pilkings always makesuse of negative face-threatening actsto avoid his subordinates losing their fear and respect for him; he usespositive face strategy when he dearly needshis subordinates to give him the response he needs. In Othello, the positive face strategy is deployed to enhance an ideal and harmonious master-servant relationship. This paper concludes that the use of politeness strategies is contextualised by the use of power relations between speaker and listener. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Objective This scoping review aims to identify the COVID-19-related stressors and the corresponding coping strategies among emergency physicians during and following the pandemic. Introduction In the midst of an unprecedented COVID-19 crisis, healthcare professionals confront a diverse set of difficulties. Emergency physicians are under immense pressure. They must provide frontline care and make quick decisions in a high-pressure environment. This can lead to a variety of physical and psychological stressors, including extended working hours, increased workload, personal risk of infection and the emotional toll of caring for infected patients. It is critical that they be informed of the numerous stressors they face, as well as the various coping methods accessible to them, in order to deal with these pressures. Inclusion criteria This paper will summarise the findings of primary or secondary investigations on emergency physicians' stressors and coping strategies during and following the COVID-19 epidemic. All journals and grey literature in English and Mandarin published after January 2020 are eligible. Methods The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) method will be used to conduct the scoping review. A thorough literature search will be performed on OVID Medline, Scopus and Web of Science to find eligible studies, using the keywords related to emergency physicians, stress and coping strategies. Two reviewers will independently revise all of the full-text articles, extract data and evaluate the study quality. A narrative overview of the findings from included studies will be given. Ethics and dissemination This review will involve secondary analysis of published literature, and therefore ethics approval is not required. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist will be used to guide translation of findings. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and presented in conferences via abstract and presentation.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"The steady growth of tourism is increasing the demand for tourism translation. Cultural words (CWs) translation is challenging since they are absent from target cultures. This systematic review examines studies on CWs translation in tourism texts to comprehend the literature and explore future research tendencies. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses, researchers did a comprehensive literature review. Twenty-one articles met the inclusion criteria after the protocol-required data selection and screening. The findings reveal that scholars are increasingly concerned with CWs translation in tourism texts. Moreover, all the included articles used varied theories. Most of them focused on applying various taxonomies of translation strategies to compensate for the losses of cultural connotations in cultural words' rendition. Besides, other researchers focused on CWs translation from different perspectives, such as translation quality assessment, Eco-translatology, meaning equivalence, cultural manipulation, and relevance theory. © 2023 ACADEMY PUBLICATION."
"Importance: Despite advances in the understanding of dietary therapies in children with drug-resistant epilepsy, no quantitative comparison exists between different dietary interventions. Objective: To evaluate the comparative efficacy and safety of various dietary therapies in childhood drug-resistant epilepsy. Data Sources: Systematic review and network meta-analysis (frequentist) of studies in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Ovid published from inception to April 2022 using the search terms ketogenic diet, medium chain triglyceride diet, modified Atkins diet, low glycemic index therapy, and refractory epilepsy. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials comparing different dietary therapies (ketogenic diet, modified Atkins diet, and low glycemic index therapy) with each other or care as usual in childhood drug-resistant epilepsy were included. Abstract, title, and full text were screened independently by 2 reviewers. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data extraction was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses reporting guideline. Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the study quality. Effect sizes were calculated as odds ratio with 95% CI using random-effects model. The hierarchy of competing interventions was defined using the surface under the cumulative ranking curve. Main Outcomes and Measures: Short-term (≤3 months) 50% or higher and 90% or higher reduction in seizure frequency and treatment withdrawal due to adverse events were the primary efficacy and safety outcomes. Results: Of 2158 citations, 12 randomized clinical trials (907 patients) qualified for inclusion. In the short term, all dietary interventions were more efficacious than care as usual for 50% or higher seizure reduction (low glycemic index therapy: odds ratio [OR], 24.7 [95% CI, 5.3-115.4]; modified Atkins diet: OR, 11.3 [95% CI, 5.1-25.1]; ketogenic diet: OR, 8.6 [95% CI, 3.7-20.0]), while ketogenic diet (OR, 6.5 [95% CI, 2.3-18.0]) and modified Atkins diet (OR, 5.1 [95% CI, 2.2-12.0]) were better than care as usual for seizure reduction of 90% or higher. However, adverse event-related discontinuation rates were significantly higher for ketogenic diet (OR, 8.6 [95% CI, 1.8-40.6]) and modified Atkins diet (OR, 6.5 [95% CI, 1.4-31.2]) compared with care as usual. Indirectly, there was no significant difference between dietary therapies in efficacy and safety outcomes. Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that all dietary therapies are effective in the short term. However, modified Atkins diet had better tolerability, higher probability for 50% or higher seizure reduction, and comparable probability for 90% or higher seizure reduction and may be a sounder option than ketogenic diet. Direct head-to-head comparison studies are needed to confirm these findings.. © 2023 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."
"Aim: Grape seed extract (GSE) is considered a herbal alternative and has been noted for its remineralization potential. Thus, this systematic review is to analyze the in-vitro remineralization effectiveness of the natural remineralizing agent, GSE, helping to reinstate new investigative possibilities in the field of restorative dentistry. Materials and Methods: This systematic review was undertaken using objectives and transparent methods as per the PRISMA guideline and was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021269585). Studies that had assessed the remineralizing efficacy of GSE on human primary teeth for the past 20 years published in English language were included. Electronic and manual searches were conducted to identify suitable citations, and electronic search was performed using various databases such as PubMed, Trip Database, Google Scholar, EBSCOhost Database, Scopus, and Web of Science. Those articles that were written in English and those that had full text available were considered because of its use in dentistry, whereas unpublished data and literature written in other languages and articles with only abstracts were excluded. The search was focussed on the effect of GSEs on primary teeth. Results: The search identified 446 citations, and 12 articles were chosen and reviewed in full texts, among which 2 relevant citations met the eligibility criteria for the final inclusion in the systematic review. The studies were of good quality and meta-analyses showed inconsistent evidence on the remineralization potential of GSE when compared with fluoride [mean difference: 16.63 (95% confidence interval: -62.48, 95.73); P = 0.004]. Conclusion: Within the limitations of the present study, the findings of this systematic review suggest that GSE has a remineralizing effect on primary teeth but strong literature-based clinical evidence in favor of GSE is lacking and also the remineralizing effectiveness is lesser when compared with fluoride. This reinforces the need for further in-vivo, in-vitro, and comparative clinical studies. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications. All rights reserved."
"We investigated the possibility of automating the prediction of the 16-factor personality traits by R. Cattell from text posts of social media users. The proposed new method of automating the evaluation of R. Kettell’s 16-factor personality test traits includes language models and neural networks. Implementation of the method involves several steps. At the first step text posts are extracted from user accounts of social media, pre-processed with language model RuBERT and previously trained over a full-connected neural network. The result of this step is a normalized empirical distribution of the posts by the previously introduced classes for each user. Subsequently, based on the distribution of user posts the evaluation of the expression of psychological features of the user is made with the help of support vector machine, random forest and Naive Bayesian classifier. The final data set for model building and further testing their performance was made up of 183 respondents who took the R. Cattell test, with links to their public social media accounts. Classifiers predicting results for six factors (A, B, F, I, N, Q1) of R. Cattells 16-factor personality test were constructed. The results can be used to create a prototype of automated system for predicting the severity of psychological features of social media users. Results of work are useful in the applied and research systems connected with marketing, psychology and sociology, and also in the field of protection of users from social engineering attacks. © ITMO University.

"Deaf education research and practice have not always lived up to the ideal of improving deaf students’ lives. Consequently, we have constructed novel arguments supporting deaf pedagogy using pragmatic ethics, the aim of which is to increase benefit and decrease harm to individuals and society. The ideal of harm reduction asks the pragmatist to pursue the path of action least likely to result in injury to others. Besides applying ideas that reduce harm, educators must also increase benefits for deaf students. Our analysis synthesizes Vygotskian perspectives on deaf pedagogy and pragmatic ideals about reducing harm and increasing benefit. We propose six arguments that can enable deaf educators to think about and enact deaf-positive concepts and strengths-based classroom interactions, including the use of sign language, images, and text, among other modes, such as speech. Our goal is to reduce the threat of harm from language deprivation. © 2023, Gallaudet University Press. All rights reserved."

"Introduction Mental health symptoms such as depression, anxiety and sleep problems are commonly observed in individuals suffering from acute COVID-19 infection to post-COVID-19 syndrome. Studies have provided preliminary evidence for the efficacies of cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, acceptance and commitment therapy, and many other treatments for this population. Although there have been attempts to synthesise the literature on these psychological interventions, previous reviews have been limited in terms of the sources, symptoms and interventions that they included. Furthermore, most studies reviewed were conducted in early 2020, when COVID-19 had only recently been classified as a global pandemic. Since then, substantial research has been conducted. As such, we sought to provide an updated synthesis of the available evidence of treatments for the range of mental health symptoms associated with COVID-19. Methods and analysis This scoping review protocol was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. Systematic searches were carried out on scientific databases (PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Scopus) and clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, EU Clinical Trials Register and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) to identify studies that have or will assess the efficacy or any aspects of psychological treatment for acute to post-COVID-19 syndrome. The search was conducted on 14 October 2022 and identified 17 855 potentially eligible sources/studies published since 1 January 2020 (duplicates removed). Six investigators will independently carry out titles and abstract screening, full-text screening and data charting and the results will be summarised using descriptive statistics and narrative synthesis. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this review. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal, conference presentations and/or academic newspapers.

"Background: According to numerous research related to learning styles and also the difference of these styles in students, this study was designed in order to determine the status of learning styles in medical students in Iran. Methods: This study was conducted as a systematic review and meta-analysis. Searching for articles in this study was done from September 24 to October 15, 2022 in databases: Proquest, PubMed, Iran medex, Scopus, Sid, Magiran, Google Scholar, Eric and medical education journals. The research environment of Iran has been Mashhad. Using the PICOTS model, the keywords: learning styles, clubs, medical students were used to search the mentioned databases. OR, AND operators and possible combinations of keywords were used when searching for articles in databases. The extracted articles were first evaluated in terms of the research title, then the abstract of the article, and finally the text of the article using the ""PRISMA Checklist"". In each stage, repetitive articles and articles that did not mention the percentage of learning styles were excluded from the study, and the articles that met the inclusion criteria were stored in the (EndNote software, version 20, Clarivate, USA), and at the end, 53 articles were analyzed. Results: The results of the study showed that the most used learning styles among students of medical sciences in Iran was convergent learning style (32% with 95% confidence interval). In the investigation of the adaptive learning style in the fields of basic sciences during the years 2006 to 2021, the percentage of using this style increased and this trend was statistically significant (P=0.0078). Conclusion: According to the findings of the study, the most used learning style in medical sciences in Iran is convergent learning style, and considering the characteristics of convergent people, it is necessary to provide effective and efficient training in medical sciences to Students' learning styles should be given special attention so that training can be guided based on their learning styles.

"The celebration of the nation and the state is a defining feature of school textbooks across the country. The present article aims to understand the textual means and pedagogic methods used in evolving a pan-Odia identity in the school textbooks of Odisha. The study has used Odia language and social science textbooks prescribed by the state as sources of sociological analysis. It aims to analyse patterns of regional representation, cultural and religious articulation and linguistic standardisation in constructing the ideal Odia identity. The study found that historical events, such as the Kalinga war, the Khandagiri site and the Paik rebellion have been used as memory posters. Though Odisha represents the highest form of linguistic diversity, there is an attempt to idealise Sanskritised Odia as authentic Odia which tends to delegitimise the region’s multiple dialects and tongues. The article has also noted that only the cultural and linguistic practices of the coastal region have been used as a means of defining the cultural identity of Odisha. Thus, we argue that textbooks work as an ideological state apparatus, organised on principles of recognition and de-recognition of text and traditions of languages, regions, religions and cultural pathways of caste and the adivasi community of Odisha. © 2023 CSD."
"Extending a nascent line of Asian philosophical research in music education, we mine Indian philosophies of music and education. Three key questions guide our project: What are Vedic philosophies of music? What are Vedic philosophies of education? Taken together, what insights can we draw for contemporary music education writ large? To address our questions, we analyze key passages from the Upanishads and synthesize ideas from these texts. A quartet of inter-related ideas emerge from our analysis: the guru, the shishya, vidya, and moksha. In brief, the guru (teacher) is revered as one would god, for it is the teacher who leads the shishya (student) toward vidya (knowledge) and through that toward moksha (liberation of the soul), which can also be attained via making music, such as the singing of Om (the absolute sound). In addition to proffering insights for contemporary music education, particularly in terms of how the ancient Vedic guru-shishya parampara adds nuance to contemporary discussions on the master-apprentice model of music education, we imagine how music education philosophy might look like if it were to be sung.

"Phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction plays an important role in regulating the functions and fate of skeletal muscle cells. Central players in the phospho-signaling network are the protein kinases AKT, S6K, and RSK as part of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR-S6K and RAF-MEK-ERK-RSK pathways. However, despite their functional importance, knowledge about their specific targets is incomplete because these kinases share the same basophilic substrate motif RxRxxp[ST]. To address this, we performed a multifaceted quantitative phosphoproteomics study of skeletal myotubes following kinase inhibition. Our data corroborate a cross talk between AKT and RAF, a negative feedback loop of RSK on ERK, and a putative connection between RSK and PI3K signaling. Altogether, we report a kinase target landscape containing 49 so far unknown target sites. AKT, S6K, and RSK phosphorylate numerous proteins involved in muscle development, integrity, and functions, and signaling converges on factors that are central for the skeletal muscle cytoskeleton. Whereas AKT controls insulin signaling and impinges on GTPase signaling, nuclear signaling is characteristic for RSK. Our data further support a role of RSK in glucose metabolism. Shared targets have functions in RNA maturation, stability, and translation, which suggests that these basophilic kinases establish an intricate signaling network to orchestrate and regulate processes involved in translation. © 2023 The Authors.

"Purpose: In the era of information overload, the density of tourism information and the increasingly sophisticated information needs of consumers have created information confusion for tourists and scenic-area managers. The study aims to help scenic-area managers determine the strengths and weaknesses in the development process of scenic areas and to solve the practical problem of tourists' difficulty in quickly and accurately obtaining the destination image of a scenic area and finding a scenic area that meets their needs. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a variety of machine learning methods, namely, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) theme extraction model, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting method and sentiment analysis. This work also incorporates probabilistic hesitant fuzzy algorithm (PHFA) in multi-attribute decision-making to form an enhanced tourism destination image mining and analysis model based on visitor expression information. The model is intended to help managers and visitors identify the strengths and weaknesses in the development of scenic areas. Jiuzhaigou is used as an example for empirical analysis. Findings: In the study, a complete model for the mining analysis of tourism destination image was constructed, and 24,222 online reviews on Jiuzhaigou, China were analyzed in text. The results revealed a total of 10 attributes and 100 attribute elements. From the identified attributes, three negative attributes were identified, namely, crowdedness, tourism cost and accommodation environment. The study provides suggestions for tourists to select attractions and offers recommendations and improvement measures for Jiuzhaigou in terms of crowd control and post-disaster reconstruction. Originality/value: Previous research in this area has used small sample data for qualitative analysis. Thus, the current study fills this gap in the literature by proposing a machine learning method that incorporates PHFA through the combination of the ideas of management and multi-attribute decision theory. In addition, the study considers visitors' emotions and thematic preferences from the perspective of their expressed information, based on which the tourism destination image is analyzed. Optimization strategies are provided to help managers of scenic spots in their decision-making. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"This article explores three understudied Middle English versions of the popular anti-Judaic Marian miracle tale of Theophilus. I demonstrate how these versions of Theophilus draw upon widely known medieval imagery of Ecclesia and Synagoga to depict Theophilus’s journey as one of soteriological regression. A comparative analysis of the two related Northern Homily Cycle versions of Theophilus demonstrates how Synagoga is evoked in the portrayal of Theophilus’s despair, which is shown to be a supersessionist issue in his misunderstanding of the Holy Spirit and Trinitarian theology. These two versions then depict Theophilus engaging with Davidic lineage in relation to Marian power, the manner of which unsettles the Christian supersessionist project of the texts and, I argue, earns him physical retribution. I show how these insecurities are resolved in the later Rawlinson version of Theophilus with an invocation of Synagoga in her “return” to Christianity, taken from eschatological readings of Song of Songs 6:13. © 2023 Johns Hopkins University Press."
"The way a subject is approached in the academic world depends on the discursive practices involved in its conception. These practices can assume specific orientations according to the language and the social context in which they take place. Agroforestry is a field of knowledge whose scientific affiliation is in a full evolutionary process. Hence the objective of this study is to analyze the lexicon used to describe it in two languages (English and Spanish), as well as the way in which this lexicon is related to the agroforestry concept. From the lines of Corpus Linguistics (CL) and by using frequency analysis tools and three-level cluster diagrams in the program Nvivo, version 2020, two corpora of academic texts related to agroforestry were analyzed, each representing the two languages mentioned, from a text collection of the period 2015 to 2020. The interpretation was based on Systemic Functional Grammar (SFG). Both similarities and lexical differences were found in the Spanish and English academic communities' treatment of agroforestry, with Spanish having a theoretical and practical (holistic) orientation, while English privileges the empirical tendency. It is concluded that the social meaning represented in the lexicon to describe agroforestry depends on how the users of a concept conceive a field of knowledge, which is linked to the historical and cultural value of the concept. Both LC and GSF are useful for observing the functioning of agroforestry discourse. © 2023 Universidad Pompeu Fabra. All rights reserved."
"The article argues that the intertextuality of country of origin information (COI) plays a significant part in constructing asylum decisions and therefore the lives and futures of those affected by forced migration. COI in asylum decisions is based on COI reports, which in turn are based on other COI reports, interviews, or media materials. This makes them intertextual, that is, referring to and transforming other texts. That is, COI reports typically include dozens or even hundreds of pages of information, which are abbreviated in order to be used in a few paragraphs of asylum decisions. This is done through recontextualisation, that is, by selecting certain parts of the text and reformulating them to the new context. The article analyses COI in 67 negative first-instance asylum decisions and in 38 COI reports and similar sources through the concept of intertextuality. It argues that COI has two functions in the asylum decisions, personal and general. Personal COI is used to assess the truthfulness of the asylum applicant's persecution narrative, whereas general COI is used to evaluate the overall security and human rights situation in the country of origin. The article shows that even though the decisions tend to present COI as objective information, it can easily be biased, irrelevant, and illogical, therefore creating an illusion of objectivity.  © 2022 The Author(s).

"Background and Aims: Insulinoma is the most common functional neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. However, there have been few bibliometric studies on insulinoma. Therefore, this study was conducted to describe the hotspots and trends in insulinoma research over the past 20 years through bibliometric analysis. Methods: Publications related to insulinoma between 1999 and 2021 were searched in the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), and the results were imported in plain text format into VOSviewer and CiteSpace software for bibliometric analysis. The data was processed using bibliometric methods to conduct visual analysis of authors, countries, institutions, highly cited works, co-citations, keywords, and references. Results: A total of 3 863 publications were retrieved, including 19 310 authors, 3 268 organizations, 83 countries/regions, and 1 005 journals. The literature cited a total of 85 078 articles authored by 55 619 individuals from 7 494 journals. Among them, research on insulinoma was mainly conducted in the United States, with Lernmark A being the most prolific author and the University of Washington being the most significant contributor. The Journal of Biological Chemistry was the main journal for publishing research in the insulinoma field. Keyword analysis showed that the current focus is mainly on ""Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor"" ""ENTS Consensus Guideline"" ""Marker"" ""Management"" and ""Neoplasm"" indicating that the focus of insulinoma research has gradually shifted from a simple overview, diagnosis, clinical manifestations, and complications of this disease to the exploration of neuroendocrine tumors as a whole. Conclusions: In the past 20 years, the publication output of insulinoma has remained at a highly explosive level. The United States has an unshakable position in this field. In addition, the efficacy of emerging tumor markers and how to develop more rational management modes are likely to become future research hotspots. Our study will help predict the development and trends in the field of insulinoma. © 2023 Central South University. All right reserved."
"Published studies on social representations of migration in the media offer two pictures that have become crystallized over time. On the one hand, migration is constructed as a social threat for hosting countries; on the other, victimization of migrants is emphasized. This study aims to investigate how literary texts written by the protagonists of migratory experiences contribute to creating a possible alternative view of migrants. The results highlight a tension in the discourse on migration. They show that this literature conveys different worldviews, which can be arranged in two macro-groups. Narratives of victimization emerge, but are counterbalanced by narratives of resilience, post-traumatic growth, and the ability to react and cope with difficulties, and also by narrative of resistance oriented toward ensuring the recognition of the identity of second-generation Italians. This contribution concludes with reflections on the pragmatic value of conducting psychosocial research on literary texts. © The Author(s) 2023."

"Purpose: To examine the risk factors (RFs), associated with Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP), and the quantitative standards required to measure them Methods: The literature on RFs associated with SUDEP was systematically reviewed up to August 2020 in databases, including PubMed, the Cochrane Database and Embase. Revised Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was performed to determine the quality of each study in this meta-analysis (MA), with a score of ≥ 3, indicating good quality. Any controversies in data extraction and quality assessment were resolved through counsel or adjudication with a third researcher. Results: An initial screening of the literature following the search strategy and manual inclusion yielded a total of 767 studies. After excluding duplicates as well as articles that did not match the topic, 112 studies remained. Twenty-nine studies were finally selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. After a careful review of the full text, nine studies were included in the MA. Conclusion: The five RFs for SUDEP included age at the onset of epilepsy ≤15 years, generalized-tonic-clonic seizure, seizure frequency ≥50 seizures/year, treatment with a combination of multiple antiepileptic drugs, and history of alcohol abuse. © Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria. © 2023 The authors."
"In order to explore the causes of maritime accidents in the Yangtze River Estuary waters, a ship traffic accident analysis method considering the coupling effect of multiple factors was proposed. Firstly, this paper conducted an in-depth analysis of multi-source maritime accident investigation reports and related literatures based on text mining technolog. A set of factors that induced maritime accidents in the Yangtze River Estuary waters was constructed from the environment, ship, human and organizational aspects. Then, the chi-square test was used to analyze the coupling relationship between these risk factors. A BN model of maritime accidents in the Yangtze River Estuary waters was constructed under the action of multi-factor coupling. Finally, the prevention and control countermeasures for ship traffic accidents in the Yangtze River Estuary waters were proposed by performing a sensitivity analysis on the model. The results show that: there are eight causal chains that induce ship traffic accidents in the Yangtze River Estuary waters, and wind, improper cargo stowage, ship type, unsafe speed, negligence of lookout, failure to fully estimate the danger, failure to perform the duty of giving way and failure of control equipment are the eight mutual risk factors that induce ship traffic accidents in the Yangtze River Estuary waters. © 2023 China Safety Science Journal.

"Introduction: A patient experience survey was undertaken as part of the role of the Macmillan Consultant Therapy Radiographer for the bone and brain metastases patients to inform future development of the service. Method: A questionnaire was developed and approved by the Trust's local Questionnaire, Interview and Survey Group to survey the experiences and satisfaction of the service including the informed consent process, radiotherapy appointments and overall experience and satisfaction. The survey used qualitative and quantitative methods, including Likert Scales and free comment boxes. The responses were analysed by counting the frequency of each response and identifying any themes in free text responses. Results: Most patients were satisfied with the consent process with 1/36 patients reporting a lack of understandable information and 4/36 wanting more side effect information. The option of plan and treat was a preference of 53% of patients due to travelling back and forth to the centre; however, only 6% stated that they wanted two separate appointments. Ninety-four percent of patients felt that they had complete confidence and trust in the professional who consented them and 86% did not feel fully involved in the decision-making process. Overall, the service was rated as 10/10 by 61% of patients (n = 36). Conclusions: The patients surveyed were satisfied with their experience of the Palliative Radiotherapy Service; however, it needs to be developed further to meet the needs and expectations of the service users.  © 2023 The Author(s).

"Humor is a pervasive communicative device; nevertheless, its portability from one language to another remains challenging for computer machines and even humans. In this work, we investigate the problem of humor recognition from a cross-language and cross-domain perspective, focusing on English and Spanish languages. To this aim, we rely on two strategies: the first is based on multilingual transformer models for exploiting the cross-language knowledge distilled by them, and the second introduces machine translation to learn and make predictions in a single language. Experiments showed that models struggle in front of the humor complexity when it is translated, effectively tracking a degradation in the humor perception when messages flow from one language to another. However, when multilingual models face a cross-language scenario, exclusive between the fine-tuning and evaluation data languages, humor translation helps to align the knowledge learned in fine-tuning phase. According to this, a mean increase of 11% in F1 score was observed when classifying English-written texts with models fine-tuned with a Spanish dataset. These results are encouraging and constitute the first step towards a computationally cross-language analysis of humor. ©2023 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural."
"This article examines the question of touch in Laurence Nobécourt's La Démengeaison. It seeks to connect Nobécourt's text to recent research on the tactile and more broadly the haptic function of literature. In this article, I will show that skin forms a border in the text, which prevents touch and contact with the world. I will discuss firstly the ways in which the surface/depth paradigm is applied to the untouchable skin of the narrator, excluding her from humanity. Thus, in the second part of my analysis, I will reflect on the ways in which the skin's touchability is reconfigured through the narrator's compulsive itching, and particularly through the exploration of the skin's erogenous dimension. Although this reconfiguration fails in the diegesis and leads only to violence, I will argue that the text succeeds in its haptic aesthetics, and its attempt to touch the reader. © 2023.

"This study explores the possibilities of using digitally produced multimodal language learning histories (MLLHs) to understand the experiences of learning a second language (L2) of a group of university students in Japan (N = 21). The study observes that learners’ MLLHs are texts in which the visual elements of language, place, person, learning resource, and self-analysis of learning process are represented visually. It also identifies 4 patterns in the ways the MLLHs are constructed by focusing on a certain type of visual element. Person-oriented MLLHs focus on L2 learning as emotional experience. In resource-oriented MLLHs, learning is perceived to occur because of engaging with language via favorite media. In analysis-oriented MLLHs, learning is regarded as a matter of going up and down the scale of linguistic measures. Place-oriented MLLHs emphasize being on site at an L2-speaking region as being the key in the era of globalization and mobility. These patterns reflect learners’ beliefs on L2 learning as viewed from a contextual perspective. This study further argues that a multimodal approach can have a significant influence on making visible learners’ subjective perspectives and beliefs as lenses through which they frame their learning experiences, as well as visualizing the dynamics and individualities of learning. © National Federation of Modern Language Teachers Associations."
"Abstract: This work deals with the interrelated problems of assessing the closeness of a text to the most rational (reference) form of conveying its sense and the formation of a reference text collection, in relation to which the assessment itself is performed. The texts under analysis for closeness to the semantic standard are abstracts of scientific articles together with their titles. The solution is based on the comparison of values for the 5th percentile of the empirical distribution corresponding to an array of fractions for nonzero values of the term frequency (TF) for separate phrases within each abstract relative to each document under consideration for inclusion into the reference collection. A variant for numerical estimation the significance of the abstract for calculating the mentioned percentile for candidate documents with maximum precision in the case of selection of the most significant for the reference collection is offered. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."
"Background/Aims Maintaining staff satisfaction is a major ambition for healthcare leaders worldwide, as it is directly linked with patient outcomes. Despite this, there is a dearth of literature on the job satisfaction of radiographers. This study aimed to explore the job satisfaction and role perceptions of radiographers and assistant practitioners at a local district general hospital. Methods All radiographers and assistant practitioners (n=39) working in the general X-ray department of a small-medium sized NHS trust were invited to complete either an online or physical copy of a semi-structured, mixed-methods questionnaire regarding their job satisfaction and perceptions of their role. Items included quantitative (multiple choice) and qualitative (free-text) questions. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics while qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. Results A total of 21 individuals completed the questionnaire, giving a 53.8% response rate. The mean score for happiness in their current role was fairly high at 7.3/10, but staff with more experience had lower average happiness scores relating to their role and working hours. Respondents were confident working in most clinical areas, including mobile units, but lacked confidence working in computed tomography and fluoroscopy. Conclusions Strategies are needed to understand and address issues that may be causing more experienced radiography staff to experience less happiness in their job role. Lack of experience in computed tomography and fluoroscopy also needs to be addressed, possibly by ensuring that radiography staff regularly work in these areas to build their confidence. © 2023 MA Healthcare Ltd.

"The aedes mosquito-borne dengue viruses cause dengue fever, an arboviral disease (DENVs). In 2019, the World Health Organization forecasts a yearly occurrence of infections from 100 million to 400 million, the maximum number of dengue cases ever testified worldwide, prompting WHO to label the virus one of the world’s top ten public health risks. Dengue hemorrhagic fever can progress into dengue shock syndrome, which can be fatal. Dengue hemorrhagic fever can also advance into dengue shock syndrome. To provide accessible and timely supportive care and therapy, it is necessary to have indispensable practical instruments that accurately differentiate Dengue and its subcategories in the early stages of illness development. Dengue fever can be predicted in advance, saving one’s life by warning them to seek proper diagnosis and treatment. Predicting infectious diseases such as dengue is difficult, and most forecast systems are still in their primary stages. In developing dengue predictive models, data from microarrays and RNA-Seq have been used significantly. Bayesian inferences and support vector machine algorithms are two examples of statistical methods that can mine opinions and analyze sentiment from text. In general, these methods are not very strong semantically, and they only work effectively when the text passage inputs are at the level of the page or the paragraph; they are poor miners of sentiment at the level of the sentence or the phrase. In this research, we propose to construct a machine learning method to forecast dengue fever. © 2023 by the authors."

"Aims: The purpose of this systematic review is to determine how various innovative non-suture silk and silk-containing products are being used in clinical practice, and compare patient outcomes following their use. Methods: A systematic review of PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane was completed. A qualitative synthesis of all included studies was then performed. Results: Our electronic search identified 868 silk-related publications, which yielded 32 studies for full-text review. After exclusion, nine studies from 2011 to 2018 were included for qualitative analysis. A total of 346 patients were included which consisted of 37 males and 309 females. The mean age range was between 18–79 years old. The follow-up among studies ranged between one to twenty-nine months. Three studies addressed the application of silk in wound dressings, one on the topical application of silk-derived products, one on silk-derived scaffold in breast reconstruction, and three on silk underwear as adjunct for the treatment of gynecological conditions. All studies showed good outcomes alone or in comparison to controls. Conclusion: This systematic review concludes that silk products’ structural, immune, and wound-healing modulating properties are advantageous clinical assets. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to strengthen and establish the benefit of those products. © 2023 by the authors."
"The Iliad is a masterpiece of Western culture and a source of meaning for the clarification of human communication. The study of the poem has focused on an analysis based on the referential meaning of the value concepts, eliding the conversational background from which they emerge and acquire meaning. In this article, this background is studied through an amalgamation of discursive psychology and the psychology of world visions. With the discursive action model, speech acts, attitudes, values and contexts displayed by the characters in conversational sequences god-god, hero-hero and god-hero are analyzed. It was found that there is a prevalence of direct executive and behavioral speech patterns, active objective attitudes, individualistic competitive values and contradiction contexts. With this approach, a new vitality is given to the conceptual study of the Homeric poem and new studies are projected. © 2023 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile. All rights reserved."
"Topic modeling methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) are powerful tools for analyzing massive amounts of textual data. They have been used extensively in information systems (IS) and business discipline research to identify latent topics for data exploration and as a feature engineering mechanism to derive new variables for analyses. However, existing topic modeling approaches are mostly unsupervised and only leverage textual data, while ignoring additional useful metadata often associated with text, such as star ratings in customer reviews or categories of posts in online forums. As a result, the identified topics and variables derived based on the learned topic model may not be accurate, which could lead to incorrect estimations that affect subsequent empirical analysis and to inferior performance on predictive tasks. In this study, we propose a novel supervised deep topic modeling approach called sDTM, which combines a neural variational autoencoder model and a recurrent neural network. sDTM leverages the auxiliary data associated with text to enhance the topic modeling capability. We conduct empirical case studies and predictive analytics on an online consumer review data set and an online knowledge community data set. Experimental results show that in comparison with benchmark methods, sDTM can enhance both the empirical estimation and predictive performance. sDTM makes methodological contributions to the IS literature and has direct relevance for research using text analytics. © 2022 INFORMS."
"Research in computational textual aesthetics has shown that there are textual correlates of preference in prose texts. The present study investigates whether textual correlates of preference vary across different time periods (contemporary texts versus texts from the 19th and early 20th centuries). Preference is operationalized in different ways for the two periods, in terms of canonization for the earlier texts, and through sales figures for the contemporary texts. As potential textual correlates of preference, we measure degrees of (un)predictability in the distributions of two types of low-level observables, parts of speech and sentence length. Specifically, we calculate two entropy measures, Shannon Entropy as a global measure of unpredictability, and Approximate Entropy as a local measure of surprise (unpredictability in a specific context). Preferred texts from both periods (contemporary bestsellers and canonical earlier texts) are characterized by higher degrees of unpredictability. However, unlike canonicity in the earlier texts, sales figures in contemporary texts are reflected in global (text-level) distributions only (as measured with Shannon Entropy), while surprise in local distributions (as measured with Approximate Entropy) does not have an additional discriminating effect. Our findings thus suggest that there are both time-invariant correlates of preference, and period-specific correlates. © 2023 by the authors."
"The Internet of Things (IoT) has pervaded practically all aspects of our lives. In this exploratory study, we survey its applications in the field of education. It is evident that technology in general, and, in particular IoT, has been increasingly altering the educational landscape. The goal of this paper is to review the academic literature on IoT applications in education to provide an understanding of the transformation that is underway. Using topic modeling and keyword co-occurrence analysis techniques, we identified five dominant clusters of research. Our findings demonstrate that IoT research in education has mainly focused on the technical aspects; however, the social aspects remain largely unexplored. In addition to providing an overview of IoT research on education, this paper offers suggestions for future research. © 2023, Journal of Information Systems Education. All Rights Reserved."
"Different spices have been reported containing antimicrobial compounds that can prevent or reduce the microbiological spoilage or pathogenic bacteria in meat or poultry products with various results. This study evaluated the effect of essential oils and extracts of spices in reducing bacteria in meat/poultry products using a meta-analysis approach by comparing the Hedges’d effect size (standardized mean difference, SMD, and 95% confidence interval, CI). A total of 240 data, extracted from 10 articles that were selected by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) from 121 full-text articles, were analyzed using Meta Essential tools. The results showed that essential oils had a better cumulative significant effect in reducing bacterial loads of meat/poultry products (SMD=-4.37, 95%CI=-5.63 to -3.10) in comparison to the extracts (SMD=-3.66, 95%Cl=-4.56 to -2.76). As essential oils, cassia (SMD=-58.17, 95%CI=-109.88 to -6.47) showed the best effect size, whereas as extract, ganghwayassuk (SMD=-4.19, 95%CI=-6.22 to -2.16) was the most significant. Furthermore, the total plate count was significantly affected by cassia (SMD=-58.17, 95%CI=-109.88 to -6.47), Enterobacteriaceae by sage (SMD=-5.93, 95%CI=-8.32 to -3.54), and coliform also by sage (SMD=-3.79, 95%CI=-6.76 to -0.82). In general, Salmonella spp. was found as pathogenic bacterium that was the most affected (SMD=-19.68 and 95%CI=-39.01 to -0.35). In the form of essential oils, dipping was the best way in reducing microorganisms, while as extracts, adding them in the products was the best method. This study provided reliable data in selecting spices for applications to improve the quality and safety of meat and poultry products. © 2023 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

"User-generated content is critical for tourism destination management as it could help them identify their customers' opinions and come up with solutions to upgrade their tourism organizations as it could help them identify customer opinions. There are many reviews on social media, and it is difficult for these organizations to analyze them manually. By applying sentiment classification, reviews can be classified into several classes and help ease decision-making. The reviews contain noisy contents, such as typos and emoticons, which could affect the accuracy of the classifiers. This study evaluates the reviews using Support Vector Machine and Random Forest models to identify a suitable classifier. The main phases in this study are data collection, preparation, labeling, and modeling. The reviews are labeled into three sentiments; positive, neutral, and negative. During pre-processing, steps such as removing the missing value, tokenization, case folding, stop words removal, stemming, and applying n-grams are performed. The result of this research is evaluated by looking at the performance of the models based on accuracy, where the result with the highest accuracy is chosen as the solution. In this study, data is data from TripAdvisor and Google reviews using web scraping tools. The findings show that the Support Vector Machine model with 5-fold cross-validation is the most suitable classifier with an accuracy of 67.97% compared to Naive Bayes with 61.33% accuracy and the Random Forest classifier with 63.55% accuracy. In conclusion, the result of this paper could provide important information in tourism besides determining the suitable algorithm to be used for Sentiment Analysis related to the tourism domain. © 2023, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

"The composition of the Al-’Arabiyyatu baina Yadaika (ABY) Arabic language textbook perpetuates gender inequality. This textbook not only constitutes language elements but also incorporates texts and illustrations that depict gender dynamics. This research examines the representation of gender imbalance in the composition of the textbook, including its contents and illustrations, and analyzes the portrayal of gender roles as depicted in the textbook’s examples. The study is founded on data gathered from reviewing, recording, and analyzing the textbook, with consideration given to gender relationships. The focal point of this research analysis is the ABY textbook, tailored for non-native Arabic speakers. The findings of the study reveal that the construction of the Arabic language textbook perpetuates a gender-unbalanced representation in both the text and visual depictions of males and females. This study advocates for the development of language textbooks that promote gender equality and fairness in their social and cultural elements. © 2023 Muassomah, Halimi, Yasmadi, Kamal, Zaini, and Jasmine."
"Video-based action quality assessment (AQA) is a non-trivial task due to the subtle visual differences between data produced by experts and non-experts. Current methods are extended from the action recognition domain where most are based on temporal pattern matching. AQA has additional requirements where order and tempo matter for rating the quality of an action. We present a novel dataset of ranked TikTok dance videos, and a pairwise AQA method for predicting which video of a same-label pair was sourced from the better dancer. Exhaustive pairings of same-label videos were randomly assigned to 100 human annotators, ultimately producing a ranked list per label category. Our method relies on a successful detection of the subject’s 2D pose inside successive query frames where the order and tempo of actions are encoded inside a produced String sequence. The detected 2D pose returns a top-matching Visual word from a Codebook to represent the current frame. Given a same-label pair, we generate a String value of concatenated Visual words for each video. By computing the edit distance score between each String value and the Gold Standard’s (i.e., the top-ranked video(s) for that label category), we declare the video with the lower score as the winner. The pairwise AQA method is implemented using two schemes, i.e., with and without text compression. Although the average precision for both schemes over 12 label categories is low, at 0.45 with text compression and 0.48 without, precision values for several label categories are comparable to past methods’ (median: 0.47, max: 0.66). © 2023, Universitas Ahmad Dahlan.

"There is scarce research assessing the productivity of scientific articles on forestry topics. The objective of this study was to analyze the scientific production on forestry topics that originated in Mexico and were published in Mexican journals from 1996 to 2019 and to identify the causes that determine the impact factor of such publications and the space-time evolution of forestry research in Mexico. In addition, to analyze whether researchers tend to publish in journals published by their affiliation institutions. The study considered 2384 scientific articles from seven journals belonging to category VI of Biotechnology and Agricultural Sciences listed in the Journals Classification System by the National Council of Science and Technology that publishes forestry topics. Bibliometric indicators were generated through text mining and analysis of co-authorship networks. It was found that forestry research in Mexico from 1996 to 2019 presented exponential growth in the number of publications. Forestry scientific production was concentrated in the center of the country. It was dominated by researchers from three of 122 institutions: Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales, Agrícolas y Pecuarias (13.88%), Colegio de Postgraduados (12.50%), and Universidad Autonoma Chapingo (10.44%). The journals with the highest number of publications were: Revista Mexicana de Ciencias Forestales (26.51%), Revista Chapingo Serie Ciencias Forestales y del Ambiente (20.34%), and Madera y Bosques (18.88%). Results show that forestry researchers in Mexico published mostly in journals edited by their affiliation institutions, which restricts constructive criticism of peer review and increases academic endogamy. Also showed the need to generate more forestry research for the southeast of the country on topics such as climate change, carbon capture, forest biometry, and remote perception, which are relevant aspects when we consider that no published research evaluated the development of the forestry sector in Mexico. © 2023 by the authors."
"This article examines the portrayal of Islam and Muslim women in Renaissance England by considering the historical framework and the changes in the attitudes towards Islam at that time. It contends that Renaissance drama has presented Islam as the Other and the Muslim world as antithetical to Christendom. This article examines two specific Muslim women characters in two early English plays, Queen Tota in Thomas Heywood’s The Fair Maid of the West Parts I and II, and the Turkish queen in George Peele’s The Battle of Alcazar. The work relies on the ideas of several critics, historians and theorists in its analysis of these dramatic works. The two texts are read from a New Historicist perspective. Historical, socio-political and economic factors prevalent during the time are brought back to life and the plays will be explored in light of these. © The Author(s)"

"The task of analyzing sentiment has been extensively researched for a variety of languages. However, due to a dearth of readily available Natural Language Processing methods, Urdu sentiment analysis still necessitates additional study by academics. When it comes to text processing, Urdu has a lot to offer because of its rich morphological structure. The most difficult aspect is determining the optimal classifier. Several studies have incorporated ensemble learning into their methodology to boost performance by decreasing error rates and preventing overfitting. However, the baseline classifiers and the fusion procedure limit the performance of the ensemble approaches. This research made several contributions to incorporate the symmetries concept into the deep learning model and architecture: firstly, it presents a new meta-learning ensemble method for fusing basic machine learning and deep learning models utilizing two tiers of meta-classifiers for Urdu. The proposed ensemble technique combines the predictions of both the inter- and intra-committee classifiers on two separate levels. Secondly, a comparison is made between the performance of various committees of deep baseline classifiers and the performance of the suggested ensemble Model. Finally, the study’s findings are expanded upon by contrasting the proposed ensemble approach efficiency with that of other, more advanced ensemble techniques. Additionally, the proposed model reduces complexity, and overfitting in the training process. The results show that the classification accuracy of the baseline deep models is greatly enhanced by the proposed MLE approach. © 2023 by the authors."
"The think-aloud method is a widely used method for evaluating the usability of websites and software. However, it can also be used with cartographic products, an area which has been neglected up to now. It is a method in which test participants verbalise all their thought processes aloud. The participants are given a test scenario containing tasks to be completed. The method aims to reveal the participants’ subjective attitudes toward a product in order to evaluate its usability. The present paper describes the use of the think-aloud method to evaluate the usability of a cartographic work—the regional atlas of the Moravian-Silesian Region. The study includes (I) a complete review of the method, based on the studies conducted; (II) testing tools for working with recorded data; (III) designing an experiment for evaluating the usability of the atlas; and (IV) the resulting qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the atlas based on the obtained results. During the study, three approaches were proposed to process and analyse the audio recordings. The first option was to separate the audio recordings into individual annotations and analyse them. The second option was to convert the recordings to text and perform a linguistic analysis. The third supplementary option was to use all the material produced and to analyse it subjectively and retrospectively, from the researcher’s perspective. All three options were used in the final assessment of the atlas. Based on the participants’ statements, any shortcomings in the studied atlas were identified for each topic (e.g., non-dominant maps or exceedingly complex infographics), and recommendations for their elimination were proposed. © 2023 by the authors."
"ChatGPT has shown the potential of emerging general artificial intelligence capabilities, as it has demonstrated competent performance across many natural language processing tasks. In this work, we evaluate the capabilities of ChatGPT to perform text classification on three affective computing problems, namely, big-five personality prediction, sentiment analysis, and suicide tendency detection. We utilize three baselines, a robust language model (RoBERTa-base), a legacy word model with pretrained embeddings (Word2Vec), and a simple bag-of-words (BoW) baseline. Results show that the RoBERTa model trained for a specific downstream task generally has a superior performance. On the other hand, ChatGPT provides decent results and is relatively comparable to the Word2Vec and BoW baselines. ChatGPT further shows robustness against noisy data, where the Word2Vec model achieves worse results due to noise. Results indicate that ChatGPT is a good generalist model that is capable of achieving good results across various problems without any specialized training; however, it is not as good as a specialized model for a downstream task. © 2001-2011 IEEE."
"Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important task in Natural Language Processing, as it is a key information extraction sub-task with numerous applications, such as information retrieval and machine learning. However, resources are still scarce for some languages, as it is the case of Portuguese. Thus, the objective of this research is to map NER techniques, methods and resources for the Portuguese language. Manual and automated searches were applied, retrieving 447 primary studies, of which 45 were included in our review. The growing number of studies reveal a greater interest of researchers in the area. 21 studies focused on the comparative analysis between techniques and tools. 24 new or updated NER corpora were mapped, in several domains. The most used text pre-processing techniques were tokenization, embeddings, and PoS Tagging, while the most used methods/algorithms were based on BiLSTM, CRF, and BERT models. The most relevant researchers, institutions and countries were also mapped, as well as the evolution of publications. © 2023 Sociedad Espanola para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.

"In this paper, we analyzed the performance of different transformer models for regret and hope speech detection on two novel datasets. For the regret detection task, we compared the averaged macro-scores of the transformer models to the previous state-of-the-art results. We found that the transformer models outperformed the previous approaches. Specifically, the roberta-based model achieved the highest averaged macro F1-score of 0.83, beating the previous state-of-the-art score of 0.76. For the hope speech detection task, the bert-based, uncased model achieved the highest averaged-macro F1-score of 0.72 among the transformer models. However, the specific performance of each model varied slightly depending on the task and dataset. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of transformer models for hope speech and regret detection tasks, and the importance of considering the effects of context, specific transformer architectures, and pre-training on their performance. © 2023 by the authors."
"With a never-ending stream of reviews propagating online, consumers encounter countless good and bad reviews. Depending on which reviews consumers read, they get a different impression of the product. In this paper, we focused on the relationship between the text and numerical information of reviews to gain a better understanding of the decision-making process of consumers affected by the reviews. We evaluated the decisions that consumers made when encountering the review structure of star ratings paired with comments, with respect to three research questions: (1) how consumers compare two products with reviews, (2) how they individually perceive a product based on the corresponding reviews, and (3) how they interpret star ratings and comments. Through the user study, we confirmed that consumers consider reviews differently according to product presentation conditions. When consumers were comparing products, they were more influenced by star ratings, whereas when they were evaluating individual products, they were more influenced by comments. Additionally, consumers planning to buy a product examined star ratings by more stringent criteria than those who had already purchased the product. © 2023 by the authors."
"This paper aims to account for the formation of governance networks with strong power to influence Uruguayan educational policies, constituted by a diversity of actors with a common interest in disputing the traditional hegemony of public education in the country. The starting point is a conceptual framework influenced by the post-foundationalist perspective in the social sciences, which is particularly interested in the constitution of political networks and governance networks in the framework of the promotion and definition of educational policies. A methodological strategy based on a network ethnography perspective (Howard, 2002) is proposed, based on the analysis of institutional documents, educational policy texts, various websites and press releases. The paper aims to show the incidence of two local think tanks (CERES and Eduy21) in the production of meanings and proposals that dispute the public meaning of education in Uruguay. The text is part of a broader research entitled ""Disputes around the public nature of education in Uruguay"" (Martinis, 2022), based in the Grupo de Estudios en Políticas y Prácticas Educativas of the Facultad de Humanidades y Ciencias de la Educación of the Universidad de la República de Uruguay. © 2023 Grupo de Investigacion FORCE.

"mHealth interventions have been reported to improve adherence to long-term therapies in chronic conditions. Therefore, this study aimed at determining the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in medication adherence among patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), a leading cause of mortality globally. Relying on our inclusion criteria and the PRISMA recommendations, a literature search was carried out in the PubMed, Medline, and ProQuest databases for primary studies that investigated the impact of mHealth on medication adherence for cardiovascular disease (CVD) between 2000–2021. A total of 23 randomized controlled trials with 34,915 participants matched the selection criteria. The mHealth interventions used included text messages, mobile phone applications, and voice calls, which were used either as a single intervention or combined. Additionally, studies on enhancing drug adherence had contradictory findings: most of the studies elaborated positive results; however, six studies were unable to reveal any significant effect. Finally, a risk bias analysis revealed varying outcomes across all studies. This review, as a whole, supported the notion that mHealth interventions can be effective in improving adherence to CVD medication even though they could not improve adherence to all CVD medications when compared with controls. Further trials with more refined designs integrated with comprehensive interventions are needed to produce better health outcomes. © 2023 by the authors."
"This study aims to understand the effects of face mask on speech production between Mandarin Chinese and English, and on the automatic classification of mask/no mask speech and individual speakers. A cross-linguistic study on mask speech between Mandarin Chinese and English was then conducted. Continuous speech of the phonetically balanced texts in both Chinese and English versions were recorded from thirty native speakers of Mandarin Chinese (i.e., 15 males and 15 females) with and without wearing a surgical mask. The results of acoustic analyses showed that mask speech exhibited higher F0, intensity, HNR, and lower jitter and shimmer than no mask speech for Mandarin Chinese, whereas higher HNR and lower jitter and shimmer were observed for English mask speech. The results of classification analyses showed that, based on the four supervised learning algorithms (i.e., Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine), undesirable performances (i.e., lower than 50%) in classifying the speech with and without a face mask, and highly-variable accuracies (i.e., ranging from 40% to 89.2%) in identifying individual speakers were achieved. These findings imply that the speakers tend to conduct acoustic adjustments to improve their speech intelligibility when wearing surgical mask. However, a cross-linguistic difference in speech strategies to compensate for intelligibility was observed that Mandarin speech was produced with higher F0, intensity, and HNR, while English was produced with higher HNR. Besides, the highly-variable accuracies of speaker identification might suggest that surgical mask would impact the general performance of the accuracy of automatic speaker recognition. In general, therefore, it seems wearing a surgical mask would impact both acoustic-phonetic and automatic speaker recognition approaches to some extent, thus suggesting particular cautions in the real-case practice of forensic speaker identification.

"Nowadays, in communications, the main criteria are ensuring the digital information and communication in the network. The normal two users' communication exchanges confidential data and files via the web. Secure data communication is the most crucial problem for message transmission networks. To resolve this problem, cryptography uses mathematical encryption and decryption data on adaptation by converting data from a key into an unreadable format. Cryptography provides a method for performing the transmission of confidential or secure communication. The proposed AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)-based Padding Key Encryption (PKE) algorithm encrypts the Data; it generates the secret key in an unreadable format. The receiver decrypts the data using the private key in a readable format. In the proposed PKE algorithm, the sender sends data into plain Text to cypher-text using a secret key to the authorized person; the unauthorized person cannot access the data through the Internet; only an authorized person can view the data through the private key. A method for identifying user groups was developed. Support vector machines (SVM) were used in user behaviour analysis to estimate probability densities so that each user could be predicted to launch applications and sessions independently. The results of the proposed simulation offer a high level of security for transmitting sensitive data or files to recipients compared to other previous methods and user behaviour analysis. © 2023 International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication.

"Objective: The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is regarded as one of the most effective ways of preventing cervical cancer. Despite the massive burden of this disease, only two countries in the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) have implemented a national HPV vaccination program. The aim of the present study was to assess the main barriers to the integration of HPV vaccination in the national vaccination programs of EMR countries. Material and Methods: We performed a narrative review with no inclusion and exclusion criteria. The electronic databases we searched included Medline, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science (last update; December 2021). The search was not subject to any limitation in terms of time or method. Studies that dealt with the obstacles or the needs of vaccination programs in EMR countries were included in the investigation. Results: After a full-text screening, the report comprised of 31 studies from 15 EMR countries. All of the studies were descriptive. The most common barriers to HPV vaccination are the following: a) lack of knowledge and awareness, b) economic barriers in terms of the cost-effectiveness of the HPV vaccination program, c) social insecurity in conflict zones, d) cultural norms and religion. Conclusion: EMR countries should focus on modifiable barriers to the vaccination program. Steps to improve HPV vaccination coverage in these countries should include enhancing social awareness and mobilization, ensuring the support of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization in eligible countries, using national resources in an optimal way, and addressing HPV vaccination in undergraduate medicine and paramedic curriculums.

"Background: In August 2017, the European Commission awarded the “European Study on Clinical Diagnostic Reference Levels (DRL) for X-ray Medical Imaging” project to the European Society of Radiology to provide up-to-date Diagnostic Reference Levels based on clinical indications. This work aimed to conduct an extensive literature review by analyzing the most recent studies published and the data provided by the National Competent Authorities to understand the current situation regarding Diagnostic Reference Levels based on clinical indications for Radiation Therapy Computed Tomography. Objective: To review the literature on established DRLs and methodologies for establishing Diagnostic reference levels in radiation therapy planning computed tomography (RTCT). Methods: Eligibility criteria: A cohort study (observational design) reporting DRLs in adult patients undergoing computed tomography (CT) for radiation therapy for the region head and neck or pelvis were included. The comprehensive literature searches for the relevant studies published between 2000 and 2021 were performed using PubMed, Scopus, CINHAL, Web of Science, and ProQuest. Results: Three hundred fifty-six articles were identified through an extensive literature search. Sixty-eight duplicate reports were removed. The title and abstract of 288 studies were assessed and excluded if they did not meet the inclusion criteria. Sixteen of 288 articles were selected for full-text screening (studies conducted between 2000 and 2021). Five articles were included in the review after the full-text screening. Conclusions: A globally approved standard protocol that includes scanning techniques, dose measurement method, and DRL percentile needs to be established to make a valuable and accurate comparison with international DRLs. © 2023 by the authors."
"Despite many studies on translation and power, little has been done to examine the power relations in tourism translation. This systematic literature review aims to investigate publications on tourism translation and power in the translation field. With Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) as the framework, this study employed two primary journal databases in English and Chinese, namely Scopus and CNKI. Following an eight-step guide, a total of eight articles, including seven journals and one book chapter, were included in the final research. Based on systematic literature review and thematic analysis methods, four main themes were identified concerning the power issues in tourism translation. The first theme showed the subjective exertion of power by the translators in tourism translation to promote tourism in a destination. The second theme demonstrated the power exertion in translating tourism texts for economic reasons. The third and fourth themes referred to ideology-related and culture-related power exertion in the process of translating tourism texts. Apart from the emerging themes, the most notable study outcome indicated three research gaps in tourism translation and power, concerning language pairs, translation strategies, and research methodology. © 2023 Authors.

"Background: International public health strategies indicate a need for equitable resources for wellness in younger children and their caregivers. Reflective functioning, a proxy for emotional regulation abilities, is a key area in this domain. As an emerging area, reflective functioning has not been mapped comprehensively and requires systematic investigation. This review examines “what qualitative and quantitative evidence is there for the value of reflective functioning assessment and intervention studies in caregiver–child dyads?” Methods: This scoping review focused on data published to September 2021, focusing on caregivers of children ≤36 months of age (including Medline, PsycINFO, CINAHL, ERIC, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase). Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines were followed. Results: From 5162 initial articles, 608 papers were screened for full text yielding a final 181 papers. Only 69 studies included multiple ethnicities. Seven of the 69 studies included at least 1 Indigenous person. No studies were conducted in low-to middle-income countries, and no studies reported data on gender identity. Conclusion: This review comprises a novel and comprehensive mapping of the reflective functioning literature in terms of both assessment and intervention studies. The present mapping of the reflective functioning literature indicates the importance of health disparities in caregiver–child dyads (these include gaps and needs for future research). In relation to gaps, studies of adverse childhood experience, consideration of equity, diversity, and inclusion, and global mental health are underrepresented. Future research is needed to provide information on the relevance of gender identity and low-to middle-income countries in relation to the impact on reflective functioning in this context. © 2023, AVES.

"When a severe diagnosis is made before or after birth, perinatal palliative care (PPC) can be provided to support the infant, parents and involved healthcare providers. An integrative and systematic overview of effectiveness and working components of existing PPC programs was needed. An integrative search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsycInfo and Web of Science. Study designs examining the effect of PPC compared to regular care, and (empirical) articles describing the components of care included in existing PPC initiatives were included. Three independent authors reviewed titles, abstracts and full texts against eligibility criteria. PRISMA guidelines were followed; 21.893 records were identified; 69 publications met inclusion criteria. Twelve publications (17.4%) discussed the effect of a PPC program. Other publications concerned the description of PPC programs, most often by means of a program description (22/69; 31.9%), guidelines (14/769; 20.3%) or case study (10/69; 14.5%). Outcome measures envisioned four main target categories: care coordination, parents and family members, care for the fetus/neonate and healthcare providers. No trials exist to date. Analysis of working components revealed components related to changes directed to the policy of the hospital wards and components involving actual care being provided within the PPC program, directed to the fetus or infant, the family, involved healthcare providers or external actors. PPC is a growing research field where evidence consists mainly of descriptive studies and guidelines. The extensive list of possible PPC components can serve as a checklist for developing future initiatives worldwide. PPC includes several important actors: the fetus/infant and their family and included healthcare providers on both maternity and neonatal wards. This leads to a large variety of possible care components. However, while some studies show proof of concept, an evidence base to determine which components are actually effective is lacking. © 2023 by the authors."

"Backgrounds and Objectives: Multiple sclerosis is a common cause of neurological disabilities worldwide. Diet is a potential risk factor for the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis and dietary intervention can be used as a prevention method for multiple sclerosis. The purpose of this study was the investigation of relationships between the type of meat consumed by the patients and multiple sclerosis. Materials and Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, Persian and English databases were searched, including PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, Springer, Cochrane library, Magiran and Gray Literature (Bibliograph, Congress abstracts), for the publications of 1998–2020, using keywords of meat, fish meat, red meat, multiple sclerosis, processed and non-processed meat. Out of 186 selected articles, 30 full-text articles were entered into the quality assessment process and results of 10 articles were analyzed in this study. Results: The sample size of ten selected studies was 11024. Statistically significant decreasing effects were identified for white meat on multiple sclerosis disease with the odds ratio of 0.81 [95% confidence interval (0.74, 0.88)] and significant correlations were detected between non-processed meat and multiple sclerosis with the odds ratio of 0.85 [95% confidence interval (0.75, 0.95)]. Calculated odds ratio between the processed meat and multiple sclerosis was 1.21 [95% confidence interval (0.93, 1.49)]. Conclusion: Processed red meat consumption increases risks of multiple sclerosis. Diets of non-processed red meats as well as white meats include protective effects on this disease. © 2023, National Nutrition and Food Technology Research Institute. All rights reserved."
"Digital learning environments afford intensive and rapid interaction for learners, which leads to a learning duration within a short learning period. Therefore, it is essential to know how to design information presentations when the learning duration is short and learning tasks are intensive. The current study designed learning tasks with different types of vocabulary glosses (e.g., corresponding pictures or sounds) and learning duration (3, 5, or 7 seconds per word). Learning results were analyzed considering learners’ word recognition and passive recall of the meaning of vocabulary with descriptive analysis. Learners' characteristics (i.e., working memory capacity, executive function, and strategy in allocating information) were collected and analyzed through three types of phonological working memory capacity tests, one visuospatial working memory capacity test, and a vocabulary encoding survey. The result indicates that text-only glosses with 3s per word (15s whole learning task) learning duration led to the highest learning result in supporting learners' word recognition. Meanwhile, text + picture glosses with 5s per word (25s whole learning task) lead to the highest learning result in learners' passive recall of vocabulary meaning. However, when the learning duration is extended, image glosses may become redundant information. Besides, the result indicates that learners with higher phonological working memory, may store more redundant phonological information which disturbs the information processes. However, if learners have a better executive function, the negative effects may be relieved. © 2023 AsiaTEFL All rights reserved."
"Negative, tragic, traumatic and suffering representations continue to dominate the discussions and content on social media in the stories and content related to Syrian refugees. The public, while browsing social media, finds that this representation is the dominant one that dominates the image of refugees. Thus, there is a potential risk that the public’s compassion will be negatively affected after repeated exposure to the dominant representation in light of the inability to put an end to that situation. This study discusses the perspectives of Syrian refugees living in Jordan and Turkey on whether they feel such repeated negative and tragic content about their stories and news on social media could affect the empathy of the audience in hosting communities with them, especially since social media is an open-source platform that all people at any time and from any place can post, re-share, comment and create content by adding texts, photos and videos, not like traditional media, which are controlled more than social media platforms for open participatory content. This study aims to explore how a vulnerable population, such as Syrian refugees in Istanbul and Amman, sees the effect of negative representation on themselves and their image in the hosting communities and does not aim to examine or offer any conclusion as to whether the public in Jordan and Turkey have experienced compassion fatigue. This study provides and extracts some useful insights, but proves no hypotheses or conclusive evidence regarding the occurrence of compassion fatigue in the public; thus, the study opens the door for the debate on the role that social media plays as a source of compassion fatigue among citizens towards refugees, mainly when they are repeatedly exposed to such negative stories and content, as well as calls for an in-depth and extensive study on the topic from the point of view of the public and citizens in the hosting countries, after examining, understanding and analyzing the opinions and their dimensions of the sample of refugees in this study. © 2023 by the author."
"This article discusses the ways in which the practical benefit of poetry, as a source of healing power to reduce distress, is enhanced through incorporating a detailed analysis of literary texts and their sources that relate to the author's depiction of the human predicament and suggestions for liberation from it. This article focuses on two Romantic poems as case studies, Percy Bysshe Shelley's ""Mutability""(1816) and John Keats's ""Ode on Melancholy""(1820), to highlight an effective way of inspiring students to recognize the poets' representations of anxiety and their poems' therapeutic effects. By pointing out the limitations of recent studies promoting the curative power of poetry, the article examines precise literary aspects of the two works, which facilitate the relief from inner affliction for readers as they discuss in detail the concept of affliction in its association with the realities of instability and depression. It suggests a method of providing poetry education that reveals the paradox of suffering and self-remedy and thereby reinforces comprehension. © 2023 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois."
"Background: Croton tiglium Linn. (CT) which is commonly called Jaypal is used in Ayurvedic preparations like Ichhabhedi Ras, Asvakancuki Rasa. Due to its toxic contents, seeds of Croton tiglium are purified before use, by the process mentioned in classical Ayurvedic texts called Shodhana meaning purification. Objectives: The objective of the present study is to study the impact of Ayurvedic Purification process on cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of Croton tiglium Linn. Materials and methods: Croton tiglium Linn. Seeds were processed for Shodhana by soaking in water, heating with milk (Snehan) and later grinding in Lemon Juice (Bhavana). Aqueous and Hydroalcoholic extracts were prepared before and after purification i.e. Shodhana. Cytotoxicity of the Croton tiglium was studied against Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line by MTT assay. Ames test was performed to study the mutagenicity of the extracts in Salmonella typhi TA 98, 100 and 102 strains. Phytoconstituents were studied by using LCMS analysis. Results: The results indicated decrease in cytotoxic concentration (IC50) of Croton tiglium seeds after purificationa from 3.03 mg/mL to 0.99 mg/mL in aqueous extract and 18.56 mg/mL to 5.45 mg/mL. Genotoxicity study by Ames test indicated Croton tiglium Linn. Croton tiglium Linn. Seeds are non-genotoxic in strains like S. typhi, TA 98, 100 and 102. There was change in Phytochemical profile before and after shodhana. Conclusion: Although both the concentrations are practically non-toxic, the decrease in cytotoxic concentration indicates Purification process as described in classical ayurvedic texts i.e. Shodhana has definitely increased the potency of the seeds of Croton tiglium Linn. © 2023 The Authors"
"This study aims to evaluate the applicability of a text mining approach for extracting UUX-related issues from a dataset of user comments and not to evaluate the Instagram (IG) app. This study analyses textual data mined from reviews in English written by IG mobile application users. The article's authors used text mining (based on the LDA algorithm) to identify the main UUX-related topics. Next, they mapped the identified topics with known theoretical constructs to place them in their nomological network relevant to the usability (the 5Es framework by Quesenbery) and UX (the Honeycomb model by Morville). Finally, to expand the study with an emotional diagnosis, sentiment analysis was performed on two levels: (i) for each recognised topic, and (ii) for the full dataset to uncover general insights into users' emotions within all reviews. The case study of the IG app confirms the usefulness of user feedback data for software development and points out that the review data have the potential for the early detection of frustration and negative feelings introduced during the use of the application. Conducting conventional UUX evaluations with users is problematic since they are remotely located, and the user-generated content of a social app undergoes continuous and frequent changes. Thus, the consecutive stages of the proposed methodology, based on text mining algorithms, constitute a proposed framework for examining the user-perceived quality projection of applications from user feedback, and they are the main contribution of this article. The used approach can be valuable for helping developers, designers and researchers to reveal user problems and fulfil user satisfaction regarding UUX aspects for specific software features.  © 2023 Anna Baj-Rogowska et al., published by Sciendo."
"Sentiment analysis (SA) is an area of study currently being investigated in text mining. SA is the computational handling of a text’s views, emotions, subjectivity, and subjective nature. The researchers realized that generating generic sentiment from textual material was inadequate, so they developed SA to extract expressions from textual information. The problem of removing emotional aspects through multi-labeling based on data from certain aspects may be resolved. This article proposes the swarm-based hybrid model residual networks with sand cat swarm optimization (ResNet-SCSO), a novel method for increasing the precision and variation of learning the text with the multi-labeling method. Contrary to existing multi-label training approaches, ResNet-SCSO highlights the diversity and accuracy of methodologies based on multi-labeling. Five distinct datasets were analyzed (movies, research articles, medical, birds, and proteins). To achieve accurate and improved data, we initially used preprocessing. Secondly, we used the GloVe and TF-IDF to extract features. Thirdly, a word association is created using the word2vec method. Additionally, the enhanced data are utilized for training and validating the ResNet model (tuned with SCSO). We tested the accuracy of ResNet-SCSO on research article, medical, birds, movie, and protein images using the aspect-based multi-labeling method. The accuracy was 95%, 96%, 97%, 92%, and 96%, respectively. With multi-label datasets of varying dimensions, our proposed model shows that ResNet-SCSO is significantly better than other commonly used techniques. Experimental findings confirm the implemented strategy’s success compared to existing benchmark methods. © 2023 by the authors."
"The boom in artificial intelligence and automated technology in the journalistic profession has given rise to what are called synthetic media (Crusafon, 2022), media outlets that produce and publish texts, audio, videos, and other news content through processes executed solely by algorithms, without any intervention from journalists. This research has several objectives: to identify the first synthetic media outlets already operating, to describe how these newsrooms without journalists work, to better understand the type of content they produce, and to find out whether these are iso-lated and ephemeral operations or if, on the contrary, they mark the beginning of a trend toward journalism without the direct intervention of journalists. To this end, we have used an exploratory methodology, enabling us to identify four synthetic media outlets, which have been taken as an analysis sample: JX Press Corp (Japan); Reuters News Tracer (United Kingdom), News Republic (France), and Videre AI (Spain). An analysis of the news content on each project’s web pages was combined with in-depth semistructured interviews with the heads of technology and communication of the three European ventures. The Japanese initiative has no human staff, so its chatbot was the only way to obtain information. The purpose was to learn about the initiatives’ news production process, their impact on the journalistic profession, and their viability. This analysis helps demonstrate that the journalistic world’s reliance on artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly evident and that communication agencies are the first companies to invest in developing and distributing synthetic content to benchmark media. These initiatives, although still limited, are the most recent step in the process of gradually integrating artificial intelligence into news production. © 2023, El Profesional de la Informacion.

"Research finds that lexical bundles are vital to fluent language processing as they reduce cognitive load when memorized as chunked sequences of language, especially for second-language (L2) learners. Although lexical bundles in academic and political discourse have been studied, their use in podcasts is a less-researched domain in corpus linguistics even though podcasts are an increasingly popular medium that offers authentic public discourse for diverse audiences, including L2 learners and instructors. To address this gap, this study investigates the most frequently occurring and widely dispersed lexical bundles in an English-language, general-audience Saudi podcast. A specific corpus consisting of 10 podcast episodes (almost one hour each) was submitted to AntConc for the identification of lexical bundles based on three predefined parameters: length, frequency, and distribution. A lexical bundle was extracted if it consisted of a four-word sequence that occurred at least five times in at least five texts. From a podcast corpus of 111,174 words, 56 four-word lexical bundles were identified and ranked according to frequency, and their grammatical structures were analyzed. Results show that lexical bundles such as thank you so much, a lot of people, be honest with you, and and I was like are high on the list. Structurally, they consist of nominal, verb-based, and prepositional phrases among others, although verb-based bundles are the most common. The study concludes by providing a list of lexical bundles that may be used for podcast-based learning practice in a L2 listening class or for independent learning.

"Dysgraphia is a neurodevelopmental disorder specific to handwriting. Classical diagnosis is based on the evaluation of speed and quality of the final handwritten text: it is therefore delayed as it is conducted only when handwriting is mastered, in addition to being highly language-dependent and not always easily accessible. This work presents a solution able to anticipate dysgraphia screening when handwriting has not been learned yet, in order to prevent negative consequences on the individuals’ academic and daily life. To quantitatively measure handwriting-related characteristics and monitor their evolution over time, we leveraged the Play-Draw-Write iPad application to collect data produced by children from the last year of kindergarten through the second year of elementary school. We developed a meta-model based on deep learning techniques (ensemble techniques and Quasi-SVM) which receives as input raw signals collected after a processing phase based on dimensionality reduction techniques (autoencoder and Time2Vec) and mathematical tools for high-level feature extraction (Procrustes Analysis). The final dysgraphia classifier can identify “at-risk” children with 84.62% Accuracy and 100% Precision more than two years earlier than current diagnostic techniques. © 2023 by the authors."
"Writing is a complex process at the center of much of modern human activity. Despite appearing to be a linear process, writing conceals many highly non-linear processes. Previous research has focused on three phases of writing: planning, translation and transcription, and revision. While research has shown these are non-linear, they are often treated linearly when measured. Here, we introduce measures to detect and quantify subcycles of planning (exploration) and translation (exploitation) during the writing process. We apply these to a novel dataset that recorded the creation of a text in all its phases, from early attempts to the finishing touches on a final version. This dataset comes from a series of writing workshops in which, through innovative versioning software, we were able to record all the steps in the construction of a text. 61 junior researchers in science wrote a scientific essay intended for a general readership. We recorded each essay as a writing cloud, defined as a complex topological structure capturing the history of the essay itself. Through this unique dataset of writing clouds, we expose a representation of the writing process that quantifies its complexity and the writer’s efforts throughout the draft and through time. Interestingly, this representation highlights the phases of “translation flow”, where authors improve existing ideas, and exploration, where creative deviations appear as the writer returns to the planning phase. These turning points between translation and exploration become rarer as the writing process progresses and the author approaches the final version. Our results and the new measures introduced have the potential to foster the discussion about the non-linear nature of writing and support the development of tools that can lead to more creative and impactful writing processes.

"Legal judgments are generally very long, and relevant information is often scattered throughout the text. To complete a legal judgment summarization, capturing important, relevant information comprehensively from a lengthy text is crucial. The existing abstractive-summarization models based on pre-trained language have restrictions on the length of an input text. Another concern is that the generated summaries have not been well integrated with the legal judgment’s technical terms and specific topics. In this paper, we used raw legal judgments as information of different granularities and proposed a two-stage text-summarization model to handle different granularities of information. Specifically, we treated the legal judgments as a sequence of sentences and selected key sentence sets from the full texts as an input corpus for summary generation. In addition, we extracted keywords related to technical terms and specific topics in the legal texts and introduced them into the summary-generation model as an attention mechanism. The experimental results on the CAIL2020 and the LCRD datasets showed that our model achieved an overall 0.19–0.41 improvement in its ROUGE score, as compared to the baseline models. Further analysis also showed that our method could comprehensively capture essential and relevant information from lengthy legal texts and generate better legal judgment summaries. © 2023 by the authors."
"Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect upon postoperative pain in teeth of patients suffering from apical periodontitis or necrotic pulp when treated with calcium hydroxide and compare it with other intracanal medicaments. Materials and Methods: MEDLINE database, PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched based on the filters and inclusion and exclusion criteria. The screening was done to finally acquire 9 articles from the mass of searched articles. The data extraction followed the screening process, and qualitative and quantitative data were recorded. The risk of bias was conducted with the Cochrane Collaboration tool, and meta-analysis was done using Review Manager version 5.3. Results: A total of 9 studies over the past five decades met the inclusion criteria for full-text reading, and all 9 of them were included for further analysis. When we assessed for pain outcome, in comparison with CHX and Ca(OH), the cumulative mean difference was -4.57 (confidence interval: -16.25, 7.11). The heterogeneity was significant I 2 = 95%, hence we applied the random effects model. The mean difference showed that the mean pain outcome was more in the control (Ca(OH)) group, as compared to the intervention group. Conclusion: Calcium hydroxide is effective in reducing posttreatment pain when it is used alone, but its effectiveness can be increased when used in combination with other medicaments such as chlorhexidine.  © 2023 Indian Journal of Medical Research, published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow for Director-General, Indian Council of Medical Research."
"In avian species, heat stress (HS) is usually the result of being exposed to high ambient temperatures, whereas oxidative stress (OS) results from the overproduction of reactive oxygen species. The current literature suggests that HS often leads to OS. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effects of dietary supplementation of glutamine on the antioxidant status and growth performances in heat-stressed broilers. A total of 13 studies were deemed eligible after an exhaustive search of the literature from Google Scholar, PubMed, and Scopus. Briefly, the following criteria were used to select the studies: trials performed on broilers; publication in peer-review journals using English as the text language; and sufficient details about the design and inclusion of dietary glutamine as a treatment for HS. Two main categories of outcomes were extracted from the studies included in the review: growth parameters and OS markers. For the meta-analysis, a random effect model was used when the heterogeneity was higher than 50%, and a fixed effect model was applied otherwise. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMD), and mean differences (MD) with their confidence intervals (CI) from the studies revealed that dietary glutamine could increase body weight gain (SMD = 0.70, CI = 0.50 to 0.90, p < 0.05), and feed intake (FI) (SMD = 0.64, CI = 0.43 to 0.86, p < 0.05), and reduce the feed conversion ratio (MD = −0.05, CI = −0.07 to −0.02, p < 0.05) in heat-exposed birds. Additionally, higher glutamine (SMD = 1.21, CI = 1.00 to 1.43, p < 0.05), glutathione (SMD = 1.25, CI = 0.88 to 1.62, p < 0.05), superoxide dismutase (SOD) (SMD = 0.97, CI = 0.58 to 1.36, p < 0.05), and catalase (SMD = 0.94, CI = 0.72 to 1.16, p < 0.05) levels were recorded in the serum, breast, and thigh muscle after supplementation of glutamine. Furthermore, the subgroup analysis revealed that malondialdehydes levels were decreased only in the serum (SMD = −0.83, CI = −1.25 to −0.41, p < 0.001) and thigh muscle (SMD = −1.30, CI = −1.86 to −0.35, p < 0.001) while glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity was increased in the breast (SMD = 1.32, CI = 0.95 to 1.68, p < 0.05) and thigh muscle (SMD = 1.53, CI = 1.06 to 1.99, p < 0.05). Meta-regression models indicated that longer periods of heat exposure were inversely associated with the effectiveness of dietary glutamine in increasing FI, GPX, and SOD (p < 0.05). Besides, increasing the dietary concentration of glutamine led to higher GPX and SOD levels (p < 0.05). Taken together, results suggest that dietary supplementation of glutamine can effectively mitigate the deleterious effects of HS by enhancing the antioxidant status and increasing growth performances in broilers. © 2023 by the authors."
"Synagogues remain among the best studied institutions of Late Antiquity. Associated scholarship commonly considers activities of prayer or scriptural recitation once conducted within synagogues and impacts of their architectural and visual programs on visitors. Yet, regardless of recent interest in embodied dimensions of ancient life, attention to Jews’ sensory experiences inside these buildings remains rare. As inspired by Karaite critiques of Jewish practices of lighting lamps and incense in late ancient synagogues, this analysis addresses this lacuna by taking a distinctive approach. It reconsiders diverse artifacts discovered in excavations of synagogues and their surroundings in the Levant, North Africa, and Europe, including fragments of glass, stone, bronze, and ceramic lamps; preserved images in floor mosaics; and remains of bronze and ceramic censers. Read in tandem with rabbinic textual evidence from Roman Palestine, assessments of these texts and artifacts inspire considerations of how historical uses of lamps and incense burners implicate atmospheric elements of ancient synagogues, including experiential illumination and olfaction, which heretofore evaded notice. The ensuing discussion thus inspires new vantages on Jewish sensory and devotional landscapes in past time and challenges bifurcated notions of public versus private expressions of piety among Jews inside their synagogues, homes, and study halls. © 2023 Johns Hopkins University Press."
"Assigning predefined classes to natural language texts, based on their content, is a necessary component in many tasks in organizations. This task is carried out by classifying documents within a set of predefined categories using models and computational methods. Text representation for classification purposes has traditionally been performed using a vector space model due to its good performance and simplicity. Moreover, the classification of texts via multilabeling has typically been approached by using simple label classification methods, which require the transformation of the problem studied to apply binary techniques, or by adapting binary algorithms. Over the previous decade, text classification has been extended using deep learning models. Compared to traditional machine learning methods, deep learning avoids rule design and feature selection by humans, and automatically provides semantically meaningful representations for text analysis. However, deep learning-based text classification is data-intensive and computationally complex. Interest in deep learning models does not rule out techniques and models based on shallow learning. This situation is true when the set of training cases is smaller, and when the set of features is small. White box approaches have advantages over black box approaches, where the feasibility of working with relatively small sets of data and the interpretability of the results stand out. This research evaluates a weighting function of the words in texts to modify the representation of the texts during multilabel classification, using a combination of two approaches: problem transformation and model adaptation. This weighting function was tested in 10 referential textual data sets, and compared with alternative techniques based on three performance measures: Hamming Loss, Accuracy, and macro- (Formula presented.). The best improvement occurs on the macro- (Formula presented.) when the data sets have fewer labels, fewer documents, and smaller vocabulary sizes. In addition, the performance improves in data sets with higher cardinality, density, and diversity of labels. This proves the usefulness of the function on smaller data sets. The results show improvements of more than 10% in terms of macro- (Formula presented.) in classifiers based on our method in almost all of the cases analyzed. © 2023 by the authors."
"Denture stomatitis is a common inflammation of the palatal mucosa beneath removable dentures. The objective of this article was to examine the systematic reviews and clinical trials pertaining to the treatment of denture stomatitis. For this research, electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and ISI Web of Science) were searched from January 2000 to June 2021 using specified MESH keywords. Irrelevant articles were eliminated in three steps based on their titles, abstracts, and body texts. In the final analysis, 47 papers were selected, which included 12 systematic reviews and 35 clinical trials. Herbal compounds and denture disinfection were the interventions most commonly indicated. We concluded that, possibly due to the complex nature of this lesion's etiology, there is no present definitive therapy guideline for this prevalent lesion.  © 2023 Nader Navabi et al., published by Sciendo."
"This study aimed at evaluating a PISA-like reading test developed by teachers participating in the teacher training for teaching PISA-like reading. To serve this purpose, an experimental test was administered to 107 students aged 15-16 using a set of text and questions constructed according to the criteria of the PISA Reading test Level 1. Item analysis was performed following the sampling using Rasch Measurement, deemed essential for determining the ideal index of test items relative to students’ ability in making the correct response. The component of the calculation comprises reliability, separation, dan standard error. The Rasch model was constructed manually using Microsoft Excel to obtain the result of the calculation, and a Wright Map was also made manually to illustrate the result of the calculation. The results of the item analysis indicate that the test and the items the teachers constructed have met good criteria. The results revealed an even distribution of test item difficulty at the targeted level. The samples’ ability to make correct answers, however, was decentralized towards the test items of moderate level of difficulty. Only a limited number of students showed good ability in their response to test items of higher difficulty. These findings have the practical implication of advancing PISA-like reading test teaching and writing models by providing more information on teachers' ability to write PISA-like reading test items and the levels of difficulty of the items written by the teachers, as indicated by the students' responses to the test items. © 2023 Agricultural Research Communication Centre.

"Developing reliable, quantifiable, and accessible metrics for dyslexia diagnosis and tracking represents an important goal, considering the widespread nature of dyslexia and its negative impact on education and quality of life. In this study, we observe eye-tracking data from 15 dyslexic and 15 neurotypical Serbian school-age children who read text segments presented on different color configurations. Two new eye-tracking features were introduced that quantify the amount of spatial complexity of the subject’s gaze through time and inherently provide information regarding the locations in the text in which the subject struggled the most. The features were extracted from the raw eye-tracking data (x, y coordinates), from the original data gathered at 60 Hz, and from the downsampled data at 30 Hz, examining the compatibility of features with low-cost or custom-made eye-trackers. The features were used as inputs to machine learning algorithms, and the best-obtained accuracy was 88.9% for 60 Hz and 87.8% for 30 Hz. The features were also used to analyze the influence of background/overlay color on the quality of reading, and it was shown that the introduced features separate the dyslexic and control groups regardless of the background/overlay color. The colors can, however, influence each subject differently, which implies that an individualistic approach would be necessary to obtain the best therapeutic results. The performed study shows promise in dyslexia detection and evaluation, as the proposed features can be implemented in real time as feedback during reading and show effectiveness at detecting dyslexia with data obtained using a lower sampling rate. © 2023 by the authors."
"Introduction: Unicornuate uterus is a rare Müllerian anomaly. Its potential association with a rudimentary uterine horn can cause a diagnostic delay. The most common consequences are pelvic pain, hematometra, and endometriosis. Diagnosis of a unicornuate uterus is usually done by imaging combining ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the role of laparoscopic approach in the management of this rare condition. Methods: A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Web of Science databases prior to 1 May 2022 according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). The inclusion criteria were: cases of rudimentary horn managed through laparoscopy only; laparoscopic treatment of communicating or noncommunicating uterine horn. Results: The search strategy identified 45 articles. After this first screening, 37 studies were evaluated. The full text of remaining articles was examined. 35 studies were finally included in this article. All included studies were case reports, due to the rarity of this condition. Rudimentary horns were noncommunicating in all cases. Conclusion: The laparoscopic removal of a rudimentary uterine horn could be considered a feasible therapeutic option. An accurate preoperative evaluation is mandatory to assess anatomic variants and to select the optimal and tailored surgical approach, based also on the symptoms complained by the patient. © 2023 S.

"Knowledge management for high-tech products, based on innovative product architectures and components, is a critical issue for market satisfaction. Scientific research has widely investigated the competitive advantage that product knowledge owned by Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) has on product innovation. Nonetheless, the linkage between OEMs’ accumulated knowledge on single modules and customer satisfaction is less explored. The article aims at identifying what level of knowledge OEMs should have on both the single modules and the whole product architecture to achieve better customer satisfaction. The research method uses text mining techniques on patent documents to detect associations of modules and product knowledge with patented technologies. Regression analyses are thereafter performed to test the linkage of such a knowledge with customer satisfaction using SPSS. The explorative analysis of the smartphone industry demonstrates that an effect on the final market is found for specific modules, such as application processor, camera and touchscreen controller. © 2023 The Author(s)"

"Ahmad Shamlū (1925-2000), modern Persian poet, is among those creative writers who showcase their mastery of language in translation as well. Among his translated works, which encompass both verse and prose, his translation of Margot Bickel's Pflücke den Tag (1982) and Geh deinen Weg! (1989) is specifically noteworthy for tremendous success and high reception in the TL context, which is arguably beyond that of the original from a literary and critical perspective. As the analysis of sample poems from the two collections reveals, Shamlū's skilful rendition has actually produced poetry in the TL. Away from marginalizing the pivotal role of translation in cross-cultural literary exchanges, this study reflects on the critique of literature in translation and literary reception as prone to downplaying or magnifying the significance of SL text in TL critical and receptive evaluations. The paper initiates with an overview of the status of literary translation and its interface with comparative literature, and then briefly reviews two world-famous works of poetry translation and their reception in host cultures to set them as the background for the argument to be made about Shamlū's translation of Bickel's works.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"Background: Osteosarcopenia, a combination of osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia, is a common condition among older adults. While numerous studies and meta-analyses have been conducted on osteoporosis biomarkers, biomarker utility in osteosarcopenia still lacks evidence. Here, we carried out a systematic review to explore and analyze the potential clinical of circulating microRNAs (miRs) shared between osteoporosis/osteopenia and sarcopenia. Methods: We performed a systematic review on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase for differentially expressed miRs (p-value < 0.05) in (i) osteoporosis and (ii) sarcopenia. Following screening for title and abstract and deduplication, 83 studies on osteoporosis and 11 on sarcopenia were identified for full-text screening. Full-text screening identified 54 studies on osteoporosis, 4 on sarcopenia, and 1 on both osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Results: A total of 69 miRs were identified for osteoporosis and 14 for sarcopenia. There were 9 shared miRs, with evidence of dysregulation (up- or down-regulation), in both osteoporosis and sarcopenia: miR-23a-3p, miR-29a, miR-93, miR-133a and b, miR-155, miR-206, miR-208, miR-222, and miR-328, with functions and targets implicated in the pathogenesis of osteosarcopenia. However, there was little agreement in the results across studies and insufficient data for miRs in sarcopenia, and only three miRs, miR-155, miR-206, and miR-328, showed the same direction of dysregulation (down-regulation) in both osteoporosis and sarcopenia. Additionally, for most identified miRs there has been no replication by more than one study, and this is particularly true for all miRs analyzed in sarcopenia. The study quality was typically rated intermediate/high risk of bias. The large heterogeneity of the studies made it impossible to perform a meta-analysis. Conclusions: The findings of this review are particularly novel, as miRs have not yet been explored in the context of osteosarcopenia. The dysregulation of miRs identified in this review may provide important clues to better understand the pathogenesis of osteosarcopenia, while also laying the foundations for further studies to lead to effective screening, monitoring, or treatment strategies. © 2023 by the authors."
"This paper proposed a method for improving the XLNet model to address the shortcomings of segmentation algorithm for processing Chinese language, such as long sub-word lengths, long word lists and incomplete word list coverage. To address these issues, we proposed the CWSXLNet (Chinese Word Segmentation XLNet) model based on Chinese word segmentation information enhancement. The model first pre-processed Chinese pretrained text by Chinese word segmentation tool, and proposed a Chinese word segmentation attention mask mechanism by combining PLM (Permuted Language Model) and two-stream self-attention mechanism of XLNet. While performing natural language processing at word granularity, it can reduce the degree of masking between masked and non-masked words for two words belonging to the same word. For the Chinese sentiment analysis task, proposed the CWSXLNet-BiGRU-Attention model, which introduces bi-directional GRU as well as self-attention mechanism in the downstream task. Experiments show that CWSXLNet has achieved 89.91% precision, 91.53% recall rate and 90.71% F1-score, and CWSXLNet-BiGRU-Attention has achieved 92.61% precision, 93.19% recall rate and 92.90% F1-score on ChnSentiCorp dataset, which indicates that CWSXLNet has better performance than other models in Chinese sentiment analysis. © 2023 by the authors."
"In the context of today's green development, it is the core task of the financial sector at all levels to enhance the utilisation of resources and to guide the high-quality development of industries, especially to channel funds originally gathered in high-pollution and energy-intensive industries to sectors with green and high-technology, to achieve the harmonious development of the economy and the resources and environment. This paper proposes a green financial text classification model based on machine learning. The model consists of four modules: the input module, the data analysis module, the data category module, and the classification module. Among them, the data analysis module and the data category module extract the data information of the input information and the green financial category information respectively, and the two types of information are finally fused by the attention mechanism to achieve the classification of green financial data in financial data. Extensive experiments are conducted on financial text datasets collected from the Internet to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed green financial text classification method.  © 2023 Ting Zhang, published by Sciendo."
"Although vaccination provides substantial protection against COVID, many people reject the vaccine despite the opportunity to receive it. Recent research on potential causes of such vaccine hesitancy showed that those unvaccinated rejected calls to get vaccinated when they stemmed from a vaccinated source (i.e., a vaccination rift). To mend this vaccination rift, it is key to understand the underlying motivations and psychological processes. To this end, we used the voluntary free-text responses comprised of 49,259 words from the original Austrian large-scale data-set (N = 1170) to conduct in-depth psycho-linguistic analyses. These findings indicate that vaccinated message sources elicited longer responses using more words per sentence and simpler language writing more about things rather than themselves or addressing others directly. Contrary to common assumptions, expressed emotions or indicators of cognitive processing did not differ between message source conditions, but vaccinated sources led to more achievement-related expressions. Participant vaccination did not moderate the observed effects but had differential main effects on psycho-linguistic response parameters. We conclude that public vaccination campaigns need to take the vaccination status of the message source and other societal rifts into account to bolster recipients’ achievement. © 2023 by the authors."
"Bathsheba’s story is split by a wide chasm of male-dominated texts, spanning from 2 Sam 11–12 on one end to 1 Kgs 1–2 on the other—a literary rift that has long presented a problem for scholars attempting to discern a coherent development and appraisal of Bathsheba’s character throughout. This study highlights the ways in which the biblical depiction of Bathsheba resists simplistic interpretations and instead evinces a coherent, upward crescendo of character development through a combination of literary analysis and the hermeneutic lens of trauma and recovery, the latter of which highlights the suppression and growth of communicative agency throughout. The first section asserts that the trauma of rape is apparent and so recognized in 2 Sam 11:1–4 through its evocative synthesis of contextual setting, Hebrew terminology, and syntax. The second section analyzes 2 Sam 11:5–12:25, paying special attention to instances in which Bathsheba’s body “speaks” (i.e., nonverbal activity). The final section examines the emergence of Bathsheba’s verbal expression in 1 Kgs 1:1–2:25, elucidating an inverse relationship between David’s waning health and Bathsheba’s ascending voice. Together, these sections attest a consistent and coherent development of dynamic resiliency on the part of Bathsheba within the Hebrew text. © 2023 Society of Biblical Literature.

"Stroke survivors are at increased risk of developing depression and cognitive decline. Thus, it is crucial for both clinicians and stroke survivors to be provided with timely and accurate prognostication of post-stroke depression (PSD) and post-stroke dementia (PSDem). Several biomarkers regarding stroke patients’ propensity to develop PSD and PSDem have been implemented so far, leukoaraiosis (LA) being among them. The purpose of the present study was to review all available work published within the last decade dealing with pre-existing LA as a predictor of depression (PSD) and cognitive dysfunction (cognitive impairment or PSDem) in stroke patients. A literature search of two databases (MEDLINE and Scopus) was conducted to identify all relevant studies published between 1 January 2012 and 25 June 2022 that dealt with the clinical utility of preexisting LA as a prognostic indicator of PSD and PSDem/cognitive impairment. Only full-text articles published in the English language were included. Thirty-four articles were traced and are included in the present review. LA burden, serving as a surrogate marker of “brain frailty” among stroke patients, appears to be able to offer significant information about the possibility of developing PSD or cognitive dysfunction. Determining the extent of pre-existing white matter abnormalities can properly guide decision making in acute stroke settings, as a greater degree of such lesioning is usually coupled with neuropsychiatric aftermaths, such as PSD and PSDem. © 2023 by the authors."
"Aims: Currently, virtual reality (VR) constitutes a vital aspect of digital health, necessitating an overview of study trends. We classified type A studies as those in which health care providers utilized VR devices and type B studies as those in which patients employed the devices. This study aimed to analyse the characteristics of each type of studies using natural language processing (NLP) methods. Methods and results: Literature related to VR in cardiovascular research was searched in PubMed between 2010 and 2022. The characteristics of studies were analysed based on their classification as type A or type B. Abstracts of the studies were used as corpus for text mining. A binary logistic regression model was trained to automatically categorize the abstracts into the two study types. Classification performance was evaluated by accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score, and c-statistics of the receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis. In total, 171 articles met the inclusion criteria, where 120 (70.2%) were type A studies and 51 (29.8%) were type B studies. Type A studies had a higher proportion of case reports than type B studies (18.3% vs. 3.9%, P = 0.01). As for abstract classification, the binary logistic regression model yielded 88% accuracy and an area under the ROC of 0.98. The words 'training', '3d', and 'simulation' were the most powerful determinants of type A studies, while the words 'patients', 'anxiety', and 'rehabilitation' were more indicative for type B studies. Conclusions: NLP methods revealed the characteristics of the two types of VR-related research in cardiology.  © 2023 The Author(s).

Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or Implantation (TAVI) is widely available yet adopting this procedure in Asia has been slow due to high device cost, the need for specific training programs, and the lack of specialized heart teams and dedicated infrastructures. The limited number of randomized controlled trials describing TAVI outcomes among the Asian population hampered the approval for medical reimbursements as well as acceptance among surgeons and operators in some Asian countries. Methods: A comprehensive medical literature search on TAVI and/or TAVR performed in Asian countries published between January 2015 and June 2022 was done through MEDLINE and manual searches of bibliographies. The full text of eligible articles was obtained and evaluated for final analysis. The event rates for key efficacy and safety outcomes were calculated using the data from the registries and randomized controlled trials. Results: A total of 15,297 patients were included from 20 eligible studies. The mean patient age was 82.88 ± 9.94 years, with over half being females (62.01%). All but one study reported Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) scores averaging an intermediate risk score of 6.28 ± 1.06%. The mean logistic European Systems for Cardiac Operations Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE) was 14.85. The mean baseline transaortic gradient and mean aortic valve area were 50.93 ± 3.70 mmHg and 0.64 ± 0.07 cm2, respectively. The mean procedural success rate was 95.28 ± 1.51%. The weighted mean 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality rate was 1.66 ± 1.21% and 8.79 ± 2.3%, respectively. The mean average for stroke was 1.98 ± 1.49%. The acute kidney injury (AKI) rate was 6.88 ± 5.71%. The overall major vascular complication rate was 2.58 ± 2.54%; the overall major bleeding rate was 3.88 ± 3.74%. Paravalvular aortic regurgitation rate was 15.07 ± 9.58%. The overall rate of pacemaker insertion was 7.76 ± 4.6%. Conclusions: Compared to Americans and Europeans, Asian patients who underwent TAVI had lower all-cause mortality, bleeding, and vascular complications, however, had a higher rate of postprocedural aortic regurgitation. More studies with greater sample sizes are needed among Asian patients for a more robust comparison. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disrupted access to food and adequate nutrition and the types of foods consumed. However, little empiric data exists on the changes in American's food and nutrition habits 2 y into the pandemic. Objectives: To assess current and altered food choices ∼2 y into the COVID-19 pandemic in the months after historic public pandemic relief. Methods: A national sample of 1878 United States adults balanced by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and income completed a one-time, online, semi-quantitative, 44-item questionnaire in Fall 2021 asking about the demographics, COVID-19 food choice changes (including free-text), and consumer priorities. This analysis investigates COVID-19 impacts on food security, healthfulness, and access. Results: More than 35% of respondents reported improved food security and >45% reported improved food healthfulness compared with prepandemic status. Improvement was reported in more than 30% of Black/African-American and Hispanic/Latinx adults, adults with lower annual income, and female sex, despite over 75% reporting reduced choice of where to eat or buy food. The pandemic offered occasion for many to improve diet, but a similar number expressed that the pandemic destabilized healthy habits. Conclusions: Our novel findings suggest that by late 2021, most Americans had improved food security and food choice healthfulness, despite reduced access to food service and retail, although with worsening among a meaningful proportion of Americans as well as heterogeneity in these changes. Vigorous federal, state, city, and community responses to the pandemic may have played a role in improving the food security and food choice healthfulness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health crises differently impact health behaviors, but when accompanied by vigorous civic and community response, food security, and food healthfulness can be fortified. © 2023 The Authors"
"The manuscript Yin Shu (The Book of Pulling), excavated from Zhangjiashan Han Tomb No. 247, is the earliest surviving text on therapeutic exercise known as Dao Yin (lit. guiding and pulling). Discovered in 1983, this Dao Yin text, together with the drawings of 44 figures performing ""guiding and pulling"" exercises found in the Mawangdui Han Tomb in 1974, are of great significance to the study of the early history of Dao Yin. Prior to these discoveries, researchers into Dao Yin relied mainly on material found in the Dao Zang (the Daoist Canon), compiled in 1145. This led to their conclusion that Dao Yin was essentially Daoist. The development of Dao Yin reached its zenith during the Sui Dynasty (581-618 CE), when it became one of the three medical departments at the imperial medical education institution. As part of the medical reform of the second Sui Emperor, Yang Di, Dao Yin became the treatment of choice, and the employment of a large number of Dao Yin specialists to the Sui court transformed the state medical service. The compilation of Zhu Bing Yuan Hou Lun (Treatise on the Origins and Manifestations of Various Diseases) under Yang Di's decree, incorporated an abundance of resources on Dao Yin, enabling physicians to potentially ""prescribe"" Dao Yin to their patients. Situating both Yin Shu and Zhu Bing Yuan Hou Lun in their social and historical contexts, this article analyses their editorial treatments, examines their different objectives, styles, and readerships, and compares the various exercises described in the two texts. It emphasizes the fact that over a period of nearly a thousand years, from the late Warring States (475-221 BCE) to the Sui and Tang periods, Dao Yin was an important medical practice, culminating in its institutionalization by the Sui government. © 2023 American Academy of Physician Associates."
"Lameness within the dairy industry is a concern because of its associated costs and welfare implications. Visual locomotion scoring has been commonly used for assessing cows’ locomotion quality, but it can have low reliability and is relatively subjective compared to automated methods of assessing locomotion. Kinematic, kinetic, and accelerometric technologies can provide a greater number of more detailed outcome measurements than visual scoring. The objective of this systematic review was to determine outcome measurements, and the relationships between them, that have been recorded using kinematic, kinetic, and accelerometric technologies, as well as other approaches to evaluating cow locomotion. Following PRISMA guidelines, two databases were searched for studies published from January 2000 to June 2022. Thirty-seven articles were retained after undergoing a screening process involving a title and abstract evaluation, followed by a full-text assessment. Locomotion measurements recorded using these technologies often overlapped, but inconsistencies in the types of technology, the arrangement of equipment, the terminology, and the measurement-recording approaches made it difficult to compare locomotion measurements across studies. Additional research would contribute to a better understanding of how factors regarding the health, environment, and management of dairy cows affect aspects of locomotion, as recorded through the detailed, objective outcome measurements provided by these technologies. © 2023 by the authors."
"This paper proposes a novel hybrid model for sentiment analysis. The model leverages the strengths of both the Transformer model, represented by the Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa), and the Recurrent Neural Network, represented by Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). The RoBERTa model provides the capability to project the texts into a discriminative embedding space through its attention mechanism, while the GRU model captures the long-range dependencies of the embedding and addresses the vanishing gradients problem. To overcome the challenge of imbalanced datasets in sentiment analysis, this paper also proposes the use of data augmentation with word embeddings by over-sampling the minority classes. This enhances the representation capacity of the model, making it more robust and accurate in handling the sentiment classification task. The proposed RoBERTa-GRU model was evaluated on three widely used sentiment analysis datasets: IMDb, Sentiment140, and Twitter US Airline Sentiment. The results show that the model achieved an accuracy of 94.63% on IMDb, 89.59% on Sentiment140, and 91.52% on Twitter US Airline Sentiment. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RoBERTa-GRU hybrid model in sentiment analysis. © 2023 by the authors."
"There was an error in the original article [1]. Section 8 of the paper uses a simple toy example to illustrate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of compositional data, using the additive (alr) and centred (clr) logratio transformations. It explains that the clr transformation is preferred because it produces more easily interpretable biplots. However, it failed to mention that, even though the alr- and clr-based PCA configurations of the toy example look similar, they are not the same. This is because the alr transformation is not isometric. Distances in alr-space depend on the choice of denominator, which spells trouble for PCA. As explained in Section 7 of the paper, PCA is a special case of Multidimensional Scaling (MDS). MDS is based on dissimilarity matrices, so if distances are not well defined, then neither are the MDS configuration and, hence, the principal components. The clr transformation fixes this issue. A correction has been made to Section 8 and Figure 5 to clarify this point. It replaces the text from “Consider the following” to “in this context.” with: Consider the following trivariate (a, b and c) dataset of three (1, 2 and 3) compositions that are constrained to a constant sum (ai + bi + ci = 100% for 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, Figure 5): (Formula presented.) It would be wrong to apply conventional PCA to this dataset, because this would ignore the constant sum constraint. As was discussed in Section 6, PCA begins by ‘centering’ the data via the arithmetic mean. Section 3 showed that this yields incorrect results for compositional data. Although the additive logratio transformation (alr) of Equation (1) solves the closure problem, it is not suitable for PCA because it is not isometric. For example, the alr-distance between samples 2 and 3 is 1.74 if b is used as a common denominator, but 2.46 if c is used as a common denominator. The fact that distances are not unequivocally defined in alr-space spells trouble for PCA. Recall the equivalence of PCA and classical MDS, which was discussed in Section 7. MDS is based on dissimilarity matrices, so if distances are not well defined then neither are the MDS configuration and, hence, the principal components. This issue can be solved by the centred logratio transformation (clr): (Formula presented.) where gi is the geometric mean of the ith sample: (Formula presented.) Applying the clr-transformation to the data of Equation (12) yields a new trivariate dataset: (Formula presented.) where g stands for the geometric mean of each row. Note that each of the rows of Xc adds up to zero. Thanks to the symmetry of the clr-coordinates, the distances between the rows (which are also known as Aitchison distances) are well defined. Subjecting Equation (14) to the same matrix decomposition as Equation (8) yields: (Formula presented.) so that (Formula presented.) Note that, even though this yields three principal components instead two, the variance of the third component in matrix V is zero. Therefore, all the information is contained in the first two components. Furthermore, note that the first two principal components of the compositional dataset are identical to those of the PCA example shown in Section 6 (Equation (9)). This is, of course, intentional. A second correction was made to page 6, where “geometric mean” should be replaced with “logratio mean”. The corrected paragraph appears below: “5. Compute the logratio mean composition and add it to the existing ternary diagram as a red square:” “Figure 1. Graphical output of Section 3. Black circles mark 20 synthetic Al2O3, (CaO + Na2O) and K2O compositions, drawn from a logistic normal distribution. The blue square marks the arithmetic mean, which falls outside the data cloud. The blue polygon marks a 2- (Formula presented.) confidence polygon, which plots outside the ternary diagram, in physically impossible negative space. The red square represents the logratio mean, which firmly plots inside the data cloud. The red confidence envelope marks a 95% confidence region calculated using Aitchison’s logratio approach. This confidence envelope neatly fits inside the ternary diagram and tightly hugs the data.” The author states that the scientific conclusions of the remainder of the paper are unaffected. This correction was approved by the Academic Editor. The original publication has also been updated. © 2023 by the author."
"Background: Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a genetic disease that causes the impaired conversion of melanin, thus leading to the development of vision impairment and skin/hair-related complications. This disease can also cause extensive psychosocial consequences for patients with this disease. Objectives: This research aimed to provide a deep understanding of the lived experience of people with albinism (PWA) in Iran. Methods: this research has been conducted using a qualitative approach. The sampling was done as purposive and continued until reaching data saturation. The data were collected through deep semi-structured interviews, and then analyzed via thematic analysis, after transcribing the interviews and removing the similar codes, 1077 initial codes were extracted. The categories were coded using open coding indirect process alongside several times of reading the text and allocating relevant codes through constant comparison of codes with each other. Results: The results obtained from data analysis led to extraction of three main themes including: (1) Challenges; (2) perceived sources of support; and (3) psychological mechanisms of coping with challenges. Conclusions: based on the findings of this research, the main challenges of PWA were categorized into two major groups: body-based challenges and psychosocial challenges. The perceived support sources of these people against these challenges were social supports and access to facilitator tools. The psychological mechanisms were divided into adaptive and maladaptive sub-categories. The findings of this research can provide a deeper understanding of the needs of these people for providing optimal care and ultimately promote their psychosocial well-being and also can be employed in developing interpretive theories about the biopsychosocial conditions of PWA. © 2023, Author(s).

"The Sylloga vocum Atticarum is composed, on the one hand, of the Technologies of the Scholastic Anthology and Manuel Moschopulos' scholia to the poets, on the other, of the Epimerisms of Maximos Planudes.The present essay identifies, in its first part, two important unidentified preliminary stages of the Sylloga, which were formed from Moschopulos's materials, and clarifies the structure of the Planudean Epimerisms. This allows an almost complete analysis of the Sylloga's content. The second part links these results to the life of Moschopulos with the help of the letters of both scholars,. The aim of this paper is to avoid misidentifications of the texts in question and to contribute to the material basis of recent research on intellectual life in the early Paleologan period. © 2023 De Gruyter.

"Background Our aim was to investigate the effectiveness of virtual wards on health outcomes in patients with acute respiratory infection. Methods We searched four electronic databases from January 2000 to March 2021 for randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We included studies in people with acute respiratory illness or an acute exacerbation of a chronic respiratory illness, where a patient or carer measured vital signs (oximetry, blood pressure, pulse) for initial diagnosis and/or asynchronous monitoring, in a person living in private housing or a care home. We performed random-effects meta-analysis for mortality. Results We reviewed 5834 abstracts and 107 full texts. Nine RCTs were judged to be relevant for inclusion, in which sample sizes ranged from 37 to 389 (total n=1627) and mean ages ranged between 61 and 77 years. Five were judged to be at low risk of bias. Five RCTs had fewer hospital admissions in the intervention (monitoring) group, out of which two studies reported a significant difference. Two studies reported more admissions in the intervention group, with one reporting a significant difference. We were unable to perform a meta-analysis on healthcare utilisation and hospitalisation data due to lack of outcome definition in the primary studies and variable outcome measurements. We judged two studies to be at low risk of bias. The pooled summary risk ratio for mortality was 0.90 (95% CI 0.55–1.48). Conclusion The limited literature for remote monitoring of vital signs in acute respiratory illness provides weak evidence that these interventions have a variable impact on hospitalisations and healthcare utilisation, and may reduce mortality. © The authors 2023."
"Purpose: As more newborns have received expanded newborn screening (NBS) for metabolic disorders, the overall number of false-positive results has increased. The purpose of this study was to explore the psychological impacts experienced by mothers related to the NBS process. Methods: An online parenting community in Korea was selected, and questions regarding NBS were collected using web crawling for the period from October 2018 to August 2021. In total, 634 posts were analyzed. The collected unstructured text data were preprocessed, and keyword analysis, topic modeling, and visualization were performed. Results: Of 1,057 words extracted from posts, the top keyword based on ‘term frequency-inverse document frequency’ values was “hypothyroidism,” followed by “discharge,” “close examination,” “thyroid-stimulating hormone levels,” and “jaundice.” The top keyword based on the simple frequency of appearance was “XXX hospital,” followed by “close examination,” “discharge,” “breastfeeding,” “hypothyroidism,” and “professor.” As a result of LDA topic modeling, posts related to inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs) were classified into four main themes: “confirmatory tests of IEMs,” “mother and newborn with thyroid function problems,” “retests of IEMs,” and “feeding related to IEMs.” Mothers experienced substantial frustration, stress, and anxiety when they received positive NBS results. Conclusion: The online parenting community played an important role in acquiring and sharing information, as well as psychological support related to NBS in newborn mothers. Nurses can use this study’s findings to develop timely and evidence-based information for parents whose children receive positive NBS results to reduce the negative psychological impact.

"Sentiment analysis on social media platforms (i.e., Twitter or Facebook) has become an important tool to learn about users’ opinions and preferences. However, the accuracy of sentiment analysis is disrupted by the challenges of natural language processing (NLP). Recently, deep learning models have proved superior performance over statistical- and lexical-based approaches in NLP-related tasks. Word embedding is an important layer of deep learning models to generate input features. Many word embedding models have been presented for text representation of both classic and context-based word embeddings. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis to evaluate both classic and contextualized word embeddings for sentiment analysis. The four most frequently used word embedding techniques were used in their trained and pre-trained versions. The selected embedding represents classical and contextualized techniques. Classical word embedding includes algorithms such as GloVe, Word2vec, and FastText. By contrast, ARBERT is used as a contextualized embedding model. Since word embedding is more typically employed as the input layer in deep networks, we used deep learning architectures BiLSTM and CNN for sentiment classification. To achieve these goals, the experiments were applied to a series of benchmark datasets: HARD, Khooli, AJGT, ArSAS, and ASTD. Finally, a comparative analysis was conducted on the results obtained for the experimented models. Our outcomes indicate that, generally, generated embedding by one technique achieves higher performance than its pretrained version for the same technique by around 0.28 to 1.8% accuracy, 0.33 to 2.17% precision, and 0.44 to 2% recall. Moreover, the contextualized transformer-based embedding model BERT achieved the highest performance in its pretrained and trained versions. Additionally, the results indicate that BiLSTM outperforms CNN by approximately 2% in 3 datasets, HARD, Khooli, and ArSAS, while CNN achieved around 2% higher performance in the smaller datasets, AJGT and ASTD. © 2023 by the authors."
"This article traces the marketing of Scottish brewer Tennent Caledonian’s “Lager Lovelies” beer cans, which featured sexualized photo-graphs of women, from the initial production of the cans in the 1960s to the rebranding of Tennent’s Lager in 1997. The article considers the develop-ment of the cans and situates the marketing in the social and historical con-text. Oral history interviews with former models, industry employees, and people who remember the cans provide insights into people’s attitudes toward the marketing. The images on the cans are examined using visual discourse analysis, which shows that the marketing was derivative of the pervasive sexual objectification of women’s bodies in media and pornogra-phy. The marketing of the cans to White heterosexual men is located within twentieth-century capitalism and patriarchal structures that enabled Ten-nent’s to commodify and objectify women and eroticize an everyday activity like drinking lager. The article considers the end of the Lager Lovelies cans in the early 1990s and the subsequent attempt to reposition Tennent’s Lager in 1997 as a desirable alcoholic drink for younger generations. © 2023 Alcohol and Drugs History Society.

"Construction companies usually record customer complaints as unstructured texts, resulting in unsuitable information to understand defect occurrences. Moreover, complaint databases are often manually classified, which is time-consuming and error-prone. However, previous studies have not provided guidance on how to improve customer complaint data collection and analysis. This research aims to devise an information management model for customer complaints in residential projects. Using Design Science Research, a study was undertaken at a Brazilian residential building company. Multiple sources of evidence were used, including interviews, participant observations, and analysis of an existing database. Natural language processing (NLP) was used to build a word menu for customers to lodge a complaint. Moreover, a recommendation system was proposed based on machine learning (ML) and hierarchical defect classification. The system was designed to indicate which defects should be investigated during inspections. The main outcome of this investigation is an information management model that provides an effective classification system for customer complaints, supported by artificial intelligence (AI) applications that improve data collection, and introduce some degree of automation to warranty services. The main theoretical contribution of the study is the use of advanced data management approaches for managing complaints in residential building projects, resulting in the combination of inputs from technical and customer perspectives to support decision-making. © 2023 by the authors."
"It is commonly thought that Dioscorides’s view on medicine is purely pragmatic, focused entirely on the effectiveness of medicines, and derived from trial and error. One reason for this interpretation is that Dioscorides himself wrote little about his theory of medicine. In this article, however, we argue that he would have arranged De Materia Medica in a way that would have been useful only to a skilled practitioner. This argument implies that Dioscorides had a medical theory, as the arrangement of the content could not have fol-lowed a trial-and-error approach. It is only in the sense of having a theory that he is able to claim that his text is more “complete” than others. This article provides a historical over-view of the text from its genesis to its reception and, ultimately, to its falling out of use. This article concludes with a series of hypotheses on the correspondence between theory and arrangement of the treatise, with the aim of narrowing scholarly conjectures about both. In the final analysis, we argue that an arrangement by family resemblance most closely corresponds to the theory that animates Dioscorides’s text. © 2023 International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science.

"Dental implant is a material used in replacing missing teeth. The osseointegration process of dental implants will be affected by the macrodesign of the fixtures. This study aimed to review the dental implant macrodesign in the past 10 years. This study was conducted in a systematic review method using two electronic databases (PUBMED and Science Direct). Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in the last 10 years were used for this review. All the search results were filtered using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews And Meta-Analyses and should fulfill some predefined inclusion criteria. The last step was to assess the methodological quality of the studies using the JBI Checklist for RCT. The search identified 357 studies with only 23 that going through full-text analysis, resulting in 14 articles included in the review. In total, 19 different implant brands were used in 12 different countries. Dental implant macrodesigns were divided into collar design, implant shape, thread geometry, and platform design. The macrodesign features of the implant were mostly developed in the variation of thread geometry and collar design.  © 2023 Indian Society of Periodontology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow."
"Objectives: We aimed to examine the bias for statistical significance using published confidence intervals in sport and exercise medicine research. Design: Observational study. Methods: The abstracts of 48,390 articles, published in 18 sports and exercise medicine journals between 2002 and 2022, were searched using a validated text-mining algorithm that identified and extracted ratio confidence intervals (odds, hazard, and risk ratios). The algorithm identified 1744 abstracts that included ratio confidence intervals, from which 4484 intervals were extracted. After excluding ineligible intervals, the analysis used 3819 intervals, reported as 95 % confidence intervals, from 1599 articles. The cumulative distributions of lower and upper confidence limits were plotted to identify any abnormal patterns, particularly around a ratio of 1 (the null hypothesis). The distributions were compared to those from unbiased reference data, which was not subjected to p-hacking or publication bias. A bias for statistical significance was further investigated using a histogram plot of z-values calculated from the extracted 95 % confidence intervals. Results: There was a marked change in the cumulative distribution of lower and upper bound intervals just over and just under a ratio of 1. The bias for statistical significance was also clear in a stark under-representation of z-values between − 1.96 and + 1.96, corresponding to p-values above 0.05. Conclusions: There was an excess of published research with statistically significant results just below the standard significance threshold of 0.05, which is indicative of publication bias. Transparent research practices, including the use of registered reports, are needed to reduce the bias in published research. © 2023 The Author(s)"
"This article challenges a common scholarly view regarding Josh 10:1-39, 11:1-15. The first edition of these episodes is commonly attributed to Judean authors. I offer arguments in favor of a northern Israelite provenance of the first edition, assessing the extracts for which there is convincing evidence of such provenance. I also critically examine the arguments in favor of a Judean composition, rejecting some of them, reevaluating others, and determining pieces of text within 10:1-39, 11:1-15 for which there is in fact convincing evidence of Judean authorship. Much of the analysis is focused on the level of familiarity with different regions of Eretz-Israel exhibited in different parts of the text. In addition, any portion within these episodes for which the geographical setting of composition can be determined is placed along the time line of the episodes' textual development. Whenever possible I suggest the approximate date of composition for a text and assess whether the extract under discussion belongs to a relatively early layer or to a late, redactional one. I conclude that the first edition of 10:1-39, 11:1-15 was composed in the northern kingdom of Israel before 722 BCE, and that this edition was later revised and expanded by Judean authors, probably in the seventh century BCE. © 2023 Society of Biblical Literature.

"A theoretical mechanism was analyzed from the micro perspective of the enterprise to explore how information accessibility moderates the effect of accounting manipulation on the sustainable development of digital enterprises. Using data from 1200 listing digital enterprises in China and the DEA-Malmquist index method, the efficiency value of digital enterprises in 2007-2021 was estimated to represent the index of sustainable development of digital enterprises. The accounting manipulation was detected using the panel PSM-DID method based on the Administrative Measures for the Recognition of High-tech Enterprise's policy. The information accessibility value was estimated based on the MDA method. Empirical studies were conducted using text analysis, the panel PSM-DID method, and the double moderating effect model. The results showed that: (1) Accounting manipulation had a negative impact on the sustainable development of ""true""digital enterprises and the ""fake""digital enterprises. (2) Information accessibility directly and positively enhanced the technological progress and scale efficiency of digital enterprises, and its moderating effect was heterogeneous, with a significant moderating effect on the ""true""digital enterprises and a negative effect on the ""fake""ones. © 2023 Wu et al.

"Due to mistakes in tabulating data when preparing the manuscript, the original published version of this article contained errors in the description of the clustering cohort in tables 1 and 3. After reviewing all the data and analysis, the authors concluded that the analysis was performed correctly and that these errors do not change the main message of the published study. The corrected tables are as shown below. The following changes to the text of the paper were also required as a result of these amendments. In the Abstract, Results section, in the following the sentence the p-value has changed from p=0.01 to p=0.02: “Patients from cluster C were more likely to experience an increase in per cent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1 % pred) ≥5% under lumacaftor–ivacaftor than those in the other clusters (54% of responders versus 32% and 33%; p=0.02).” In the Results, Study population section of the article (second paragraph in that section), the number of “responders” with improvement in FEV1 has changed from 102 to 101: “101 of 283 patients (36%) had an improvement in FEV1 % pred ≥5% in absolute value and were considered as responders.” In the Results, CT morphological phenotype identification section, the sentence that originally read: “The proportion of patients with methicillin-susceptible Staphyloccocus aureus colonisation was significantly higher in cluster C than in the other two clusters (77% for cluster C versus 62% for cluster A and 64% for cluster B, p<0.01).” Has been corrected to: “The proportion of patients with methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus colonisation was significantly lower in cluster C than in the other two clusters (6% for cluster C versus 26% for cluster A and 21% for cluster B, p=0.01).” In the same section, in the following the sentence the p-value has changed from p=0.01 to p=0.02: “Interestingly, patients from cluster C, who had less morphologically and functionally severe disease, were better responders to treatment than the others (54% of responders in cluster C versus 32% in cluster A and 33% in cluster B, p=0.02).” The article has been corrected and republished online.

"Aims This systematic review aimed to summarize the full range of complications reported following ankle arthroscopy and the frequency at which they occur. Methods A computer-based search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Emcare, and ISI Web of Science. Two-stage title/abstract and full-text screening was performed independently by two reviewers. English-language original research studies reporting perioperative complications in a cohort of at least ten patients undergoing ankle arthroscopy were included. Complications were pooled across included studies in order to derive an overall complication rate. Quality assessment was performed using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine levels of evidence classification. Results A total of 150 studies describing 7,942 cases of ankle arthroscopy in 7,777 patients were included. The overall pooled complication rate was 325/7,942 (4.09%). The most common complication was neurological injury, accounting for 180/325 (55.4%) of all complications. Of these, 59 (32.7%) affected the superficial peroneal nerve. Overall, 36/180 (20%) of all nerve injuries were permanent. The overall complication rate following anterior ankle arthroscopy was 205/4,709 (4.35%) compared to a rate of 35/528 (6.6%) following posterior arthroscopy. Neurological injury occurred in 52/1,998 (2.6%) of anterior cases using distraction, compared to 59/2,711 (2.2%) in cases with no distraction. The overall rate of major complications was 16/7,942 (0.2%), with the most common major complication – deep vein thrombosis – occurring in five cases. Conclusion This comprehensive systematic review demonstrates that ankle arthroscopy is a safe procedure with a low overall complication rate. The majority of complications are minor, with potentially life-threatening complications reported in only 0.2% of patients. © 2023 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery."
"Objectives: Pre-pregnancy diet has an important role in preparing for healthy generation. However, evidence on this issue has been scarce. A scoping review synthesising current evidence will support the demand to map ‘what has been researched’ on pre-pregnancy diet and maternal and child health. Methods: Systematic search was performed using PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Study design) framework in electronic databases. Articles were screened for eligibility, summarized, and the quality was assessed using the National Institute of Health assessment tool. The review structure complies with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guide. Results: Forty-two articles were included after full-text screening. Twenty-five studies were in high-income countries (HICs), six in each upper-middle income, five in lower-middle income countries (LMICs), and one in low-income countries (LIC). Based on the regions: North America (n = 16), Europe (n = 5), South America (n = 4), Australia (n = 4), Asia (n = 5), Middle East (n = 2), and sub-Saharan Africa (n = 1). The two-most observed diet-related exposures were dietary pattern (n = 17) and dietary quality (n = 12). The most assessed outcome was gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 28) and fetal and newborn anthropometry (n = 7). The average quality score±standard deviation was 70±18%. Conclusions: Research related to pre-pregnancy diet is still concentrated in HICs. The context of diet may vary; therefore, future research is encouraged in LMICs and LICs context, and Mediterranean, South-East Asia, Pacific, and African regions. Some maternal and child nutrition-related morbidity, such as anemia and micronutrient deficiencies, have not been discussed. Research on these aspects will benefit to fill in the gaps related to pre-pregnancy diet and maternal and child health. Copyright © 2023 The Korean Society for Preventive Medicine."
"Objective: The current systematic review was planned to provide quality assessment of different exercise regimes and their outcomes on the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome, and to see if one exercise regime was better than the rest. Methods: Search was conducted on PubMed and Google Scholar databases for studies published between 2001 and 2021 whose full text was available. The search yielded 28 studies that were reviewed. Results: The current evidence suggests that exercise regimes, such as high-intensity interval training, progressive resistance training, aerobic exercises, and yoga may improve polycystic ovary syndrome conditions. This is accomplished through treating associated risk factors, like body morphology, insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, lipid profile, reproductive hormones, menstrual cycle, and quality of life. Conclusion: Exercise regimes improves several symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome. However, selecting a specific exercise regime over others as the standardised treatment protocol remained inconclusive. © 2023 Pakistan Medical Association. All rights reserved."

"Background: Single herb Ayurvedic lipid-based formulations of Glycyrrhiza glabra are used as oral, nasal and topical applications for reducing radiotherapy induced side effects in oral cavity cancer patients. These formulations are reported to be de-glycyrrhized, thus minimizing adverse effects of glycyrrhizin on longer consumption. Being a proprietary formulation with specific ratio of herb, lipid and liquid media, there is a need of pharmaceutical standardization and stability study to be conducted for quality control and quality assurance. Objective: Standardization of Yashtimadhu Ghrut (YG) and Yashtimadhu Taila (YT) based on pharmaceutical characters, safety tests, chromatographic analysis and stability study. Material and methods: Two formulations viz., YG and YT were prepared using cow's ghee and sesame oil, respectively. Basic physicochemical analysis, Thin Layer Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid Chromatography of glabridin and 18-β glycyrrhetinic acid, microbial load and heavy metal analysis were performed. Long term (0,3,6,9,12 months) as well as accelerated (0,3,6 months) stability study was conducted and extrapolated shelf-life was calculated for both the drugs. Result: Organoleptic and basic physicochemical characters were comparable for both the products while safety parameters were within permissible limits. Extrapolated shelf-life was deduced as 1.74 and 0.67 years for YG and YT, respectively. Conclusion: Single herb- G. glabra based lipid formulations were standardized and monographs were established. Shelf-life, though complying with classical Ayurvedic texts, indicates further research work with respect to pre-treatment of lipids and packaging systems for its enhancement. © 2023 The Authors"
"Depression is a serious mental health disorder that poses a major public health concern in Thailand and have a profound impact on individuals’ physical and mental health. In addition, the lack of number to mental health services and limited number of psychiatrists in Thailand make depression particularly challenging to diagnose and treat, leaving many individuals with the condition untreated. Recent studies have explored the use of natural language processing to enable access to the classification of depression, particularly with a trend toward transfer learning from pre-trained language model. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the effectiveness of using XLM-RoBERTa, a pre-trained multi-lingual language model supporting the Thai language, for the classification of depression from a limited set of text transcripts from speech responses. Twelve Thai depression assessment questions were developed to collect text transcripts of speech responses to be used with XLM-RoBERTa in transfer learning. The results of transfer learning with text transcription from speech responses of 80 participants (40 with depression and 40 normal control) showed that when only one question (Q1) of “How are you these days?” was used, the recall, precision, specificity, and accuracy were 82.5%, 84.65, 85.00, and 83.75%, respectively. When utilizing the first three questions from Thai depression assessment tasks (Q1 − Q3), the values increased to 87.50%, 92.11%, 92.50%, and 90.00%, respectively. The local interpretable model explanations were analyzed to determine which words contributed the most to the model’s word cloud visualization. Our findings were consistent with previously published literature and provide similar explanation for clinical settings. It was discovered that the classification model for individuals with depression relied heavily on negative terms such as ‘not,’ ‘sad,’, ‘mood’, ‘suicide’, ‘bad’, and ‘bore’ whereas normal control participants used neutral to positive terms such as ‘recently,’ ‘fine,’, ‘normally’, ‘work’, and ‘working’. The findings of the study suggest that screening for depression can be facilitated by eliciting just three questions from patients with depression, making the process more accessible and less time-consuming while reducing the already huge burden on healthcare workers.

"Offline handwritten Chinese recognition is an important research area of pattern recognition, including offline handwritten Chinese character recognition (offline HCCR) and offline handwritten Chinese text recognition (offline HCTR), which are closely related to daily life. With new deep learning techniques and the combination with other domain knowledge, offline handwritten Chinese recognition has gained breakthroughs in methods and performance in recent years. However, there have yet to be articles that provide a technical review of this field since 2016. In light of this, this paper reviews the research progress and challenges of offline handwritten Chinese recognition based on traditional techniques, deep learning methods, methods combining deep learning with traditional techniques, and knowledge from other areas from 2016 to 2022. Firstly, it introduces the research background and status of handwritten Chinese recognition, standard datasets, and evaluation metrics. Secondly, a comprehensive summary and analysis of offline HCCR and offline HCTR approaches during the last seven years is provided, along with an explanation of their concepts, specifics, and performances. Finally, the main research problems in this field over the past few years are presented. The challenges still exist in offline handwritten Chinese recognition are discussed, aiming to inspire future research work. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Osteosarcopenia, a combination of osteopenia/osteoporosis and sarcopenia, is a common condition among older adults. While numerous studies and meta-analyses have been conducted on the treatment of osteoporosis, the pharmacological treatment of osteosarcopenia still lacks evidence. Denosumab, a human monoclonal antibody, has shown encouraging results for the treatment of osteosarcopenia. Our systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investi-gate the potential dual role of denosumab as an anti-resorptive agent and for other beneficial muscle-related effects in patients with osteosarcopenia, and to evaluate whether denosumab can be a treatment of choice compared to bisphosphonate. Methods: Relevant literature was collated from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, and Google Scholar databases. The primary outcome was denosumab’s effect on lumbar spine bone mineral density (LS BMD), handgrip strength, and gait speed change. The secondary outcome was the effect of denosumab on appendicular lean mass (ALM). The outcomes were presented as mean dif-ference (MD). A random effects model was used in the analysis to represent the population. The risk of bias was assessed using funnel plots. Results: Out of the 3,074 studies found, four full-text studies met the inclusion criteria, including 264 and 244 participants in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Regarding a primary outcome, our meta-analysis showed that deno-sumab showed no significant differences in LS BMD and gait speed changes compared to other agents—MD=0.37, 95% confidence interval (CI),-0.35 to 0.79; p=0.09 and MD=0.11; 95% CI,-0.18 to 0.40; p=0.46, respectively. Denosumab had a significant effect on handgrip strength change compared to standard agents—MD=5.16; 95% CI, 1.38 to 18.94; p=0.007, based on the random effects model. Conclusions: Denosumab was better than bisphosphonate and placebo in improving muscle strength (handgrip strength). Therefore, denosumab may be favored in individuals with osteosarcopenia to improve muscular performance and reduce fall risk. © 2023 by The Korean Geriatrics Society."
"A computer vision model known as a generative adversarial network (GAN) creates all the visuals, including images, movies, and sounds. One of the most well-known subfields of deep learning and machine learning is generative adversarial networks. It is employed for text-to-image translations, as well as image-to-image and conceptual image-to-image translations. Different techniques are used in the processing and generation of visual data, which can lead to confusion and uncertainty. With this in mind, we define some solid mathematical concepts to model and solve the aforementioned problem. Complex picture fuzzy soft relations are defined in this study by taking the Cartesian product of two complex picture fuzzy soft sets. Furthermore, the types of complex picture fuzzy soft relations are explained, and their results are also discussed. The complex picture fuzzy soft relation has an extensive structure comprising membership, abstinence, and non-membership degrees with multidimensional variables. Therefore, this paper provides modeling methodologies based on complex picture fuzzy soft relations, which are used for the analysis of generative adversarial networks. In the process, the score functions are also formulated. Finally, a comparative analysis of existing techniques was performed to show the validity of the proposed work. © 2023 by the authors."
"Augmented reality (AR) is a significant Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR4.0) technology that employs computer-generated display, sound, text, and effects to enhance the user's real-world experience via wearable devices. Order picking processes have had a substantial influence on overall operational efficiency in warehouse management systems (WMS). The conventional picking process is challenging to handle, which may result in deviations from the intended picking performance. Pick-by-vision, a new technological solution for order picking, is receiving growing attention and is now considered a significant WMS-supporting technology. This article explores the positive implications and prospects of utilizing AR pick-by-vision technology in the warehouse picking processes by performing a narrative review of the previous review articles. To demonstrate the focus of the main area, this study also presents the hierarchical classification structure of AR implementation in WMS and highlights the pick-by-vision method. The analysis provided important key findings by evaluating 23 articles (original articles and case studies) on AR pick-by-vision technology applications, which are significant to the prospective advantages of AR pick-by-vision deployment in warehouse operations. This study gathers knowledge and insight that can be used by both academics and professionals who are interested in optimizing this new advanced technology for future research. © Acta Logistica, www.actalogistica.eu."
"Relationship skills coaching is a kind of psychotherapy that helps people to communicate in a healthier way. It helps with personal problems and issues such as, for example: trust, lying, respect, anger-management, communication, conflict, power struggles, abuse, jealousy, romance, intimacy, parenting, in-laws, divorce, loneliness, stress, fear, anxiety, depression, and so on. Currently, relationship skills coaching is becoming a trendy profession in Egypt and many coaches are becoming famous. Many of these coaches communicate with people using their Facebook pages. This paper focuses mainly on a selection of the Facebook posts of two coaches, namely, Howayda Aldemerdash and Waleed Khairy. The study provides a positive discourse analysis (PDA) (Martin, 1995, 2004, 2006) of the selected posts. PDA emphasises the function of discourse construction in motivating change into a better world. The theoretical basis of PDA is Appraisal theory, which focuses on the evaluative resources in discourse and is comprised of three sub-systems: Attitude (people’s feelings and evaluations), Engagement (the voices of the author and texts) and the Graduation system (the different levels and gradability of evaluation). The study provides a significant application of PDA to Arabic discourse and sheds light on the nature of relationship skills coaching in Egypt. The analysis shows that Waleed Khairy deals with issues related to love and trust; whereas Howayda Aldemerdash focuses on the relationship between couples and marital problems. However, both coaches employ the three sub-systems of Appraisal theory to reach out to their followers and construct themselves as authoritative, expert, engaged, and emotional. © 2023 Wesam M. A.

"On June 16, 2018, Beyoncé and Jay-Z released ""Apeshit""-a trap-styled hip hop track featuring a chorus of ""I can't believe we made it / Have you ever seen the crowd going apeshit?""The muchcommented- on music video for the track was framed as a hip hop takeover of the world's most visited museum-Paris's Louvre-featuring pop's reigning power couple, marketed as ""The Carters,""making themselves at home with a collection of dancers in flesh-colored black, brown, and beige bodysuits. While the video was generally received through the split-screen frame of either a cutting decolonial takedown of this monument to Western civilization or the ultimate in money-flaunting bling spectacle, a more subtle and complex set of issues is at play. This article examines the deep historical ambivalences at play in this pop cultural artifact. Employing multi-modal methodologies that combine visual and musical arts perspectives articulated via the frames of postcolonial studies, this analysis theorizes the cultural ""traps""in effect. Ranging from the track's ""trap""sonic production and lyrical rhetoric of escape (""we made it""), to the historical trap of musealized colonial plunder and the Louvre's labyrinthine, oft-subterranean floor plan, to the ""trappings""of consumption, bourgeois self-making, and aesthetic contemplation, we seek to illustrate how this socio-cultural text destabilizes Enlightenment universalism and its public/private split.  © 2023 by the International Association for the Study of Popular Music, U.S. Branch (IASPM-US)."
"Background: Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) patients are burdened by the effect of the disease process and treatment toxicities on organs important in everyday activities, such as breathing, speaking, eating, and drinking. There is a rise in OPSCC due to human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated OPSCC, affecting younger and healthier patients and with a better overall prognosis. Emphasis must be shared between oncologic outcomes and the effects on quality of life. While there have been efforts to study global and physical quality of life, the impact on psychosocial quality of life has not yet been specifically reviewed. Methods: A scoping review methodology was employed to explore the emotional, social, and mental quality of life in OPSCC patients and determine the impact of HPV status or treatment modalities. Results: Eighty-seven full-text articles were evaluated for eligibility. Fifteen articles met final inclusion criteria. The majority of the studies were conducted in the United States (n = 10) and study methodology was divided between cross-sectional (n = 6), prospective (n = 5), and retrospective studies (n = 4). Four psychosocial quality of life themes were explored: the impact on mental health and emotional wellbeing, social wellbeing and function, stress, and relationship and sexual behavior. Eighteen different patient-reported outcome measures were used, including both general head and neck oncology questionnaires and symptom-specific surveys. Conclusion: There is a paucity of research regarding the effect of OPSCC on patients’ psychosocial quality of life. Learning more about this component of quality of life can guide outreach programs and multidisciplinary involvement in improving patient care. © 2023 by the authors."
"Aim: To provide dental practitioners and researchers with a comprehensive review of the historical development, chemical composition, mechanisms of action, advantages, and drawbacks of different chemomechanical caries removal (CMCR) agents. Methods: An electronic search was performed for all articles published on CMCR agents in various databases, including the Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, and Google Scholar bibliographic databases, from January 1, 1975, to July 31, 2022. Results: Records were identified using the following search terms: Brix3000, Carie-Care, Caridex, Carisolv, chemomechanical caries removal, conventional surgical method, and Papacárie. A total of 171 articles were screened based on the titles and abstracts, of which 126 were deemed eligible for inclusion after duplicates were removed. Following a manual search of the reference list, eight articles were added. Articles were then excluded for other reasons, such as being written before 1975, being written in a language other than English, and the non-availability of the full text. Overall, 120 articles were included in the analysis (literature reviews [n = 27], systematic reviews [n = 8], research articles [n = 82], case reports [n = 3]). Conclusion: CMCR is a potential method of caries control in the future as an alternative to the conventional surgical approach in standard dentistry applications. It is more widely accepted, less painful, and has comparable efficacy to the conventional surgical method. Clinical significance: A continuous trend among manufacturers has been observed since 1975 to reduce the drawbacks of CMCR agents. Moreover, evidence-based minimally invasive techniques, including CMCR agents that require minimal or no aerosol-generating procedures, are preferred while measures to control the spread of coronavirus disease are in force. © 2023 King Saud University"
"Information on historical flood levels can be communicated verbally, in documents, or in the form of flood marks. The latter are the most useful from the point of view of public awareness building and mathematical modeling of floods. Information about flood marks can be found in documents, but nowadays, they are starting to appear more often on the Internet. The only problem is finding them. The aim of the presented work is to create a new model for classifying Internet sources using advanced text analysis (including named entity recognition), deep neural networks, and spatial analysis. As a novelty in models of this type, it was proposed to use a matrix of minimum distances between toponyms (rivers and towns/villages) found in the text. The resulting distance matrix for Poland was published as open data. Each of the methods used is well known, but so far, no one has combined them into one ensemble machine learning model in such a way. The proposed SD-NER model achieved an F1 score of 0.920 for the binary classification task, improving the model without this spatial module by 17%. The proposed model can be successfully implemented after minor modifications for other classification tasks where spatial information about toponyms is important. © 2023 by the author."
"Mental health and well-being are increasingly important topics in discussions on public health [1]. The COVID-19 pandemic further revealed critical gaps in existing mental health services as factors such as job losses and corresponding financial issues, prolonged physical illness and death, and physical isolation led to a sharp rise in mental health conditions [2]. As such, there is increasing interest in the viability and desirability of digital mental health applications. While these dedicated applications vary widely, from platforms that connect users with healthcare professionals to diagnostic tools to self-assessments, this article specifically explores the implications of digital mental health applications in the form of chatbots [3]. Chatbots can be text based or voice enabled and may be rule based (i.e., linguistics based) or based on machine learning (ML). They can utilize the power of conversational agents well-suited to task-oriented interactions, like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, or Google Assistant. But increasingly, chatbot developers are leveraging conversational artificial intelligence (AI), which is the suite of tools and techniques that allow a computer program to seemingly carry out a conversational experience with a person or a group.  © 1982-2012 IEEE."
"This study aims to analyse the transformation of urban greenery into greenfield housing development from 2019 to 2023 in the medium-sized city of Rzeszow (Poland) by evaluating the validity of references to the greenery in advertising texts on the developers’ websites. Furthermore, to assess the impact of the proposed greenery-related changes on urban green infrastructure. Through web-based research, 13 greenfield housing developments were identified. Changes in land use of areas that were allocated to urban green infrastructure were highlighted by applying GIS spatial analysis. The written and visual content analysis identified references to greenery in advertising campaigns. Finally, status relations analysis was performed to assess whether the specific advertising website presents an added ecological asset that can be considered as a nature-based solution or should be interpreted as greenwashing. The study revealed that the advertising websites for greenfield housing development constructed from 2019 to 2023 in Rzeszow do not represent an additional ecological asset, but committed greenwashing. All analysed housing estates trigger irretrievable environmental damage. The advertising material does not define the environmental indicators of the housing estates, including how the new construction would compensate for the destruction of natural habitats. © 2023 by the authors."
"The present study investigated the role of syntactic awareness in reading comprehension among English–French bilinguals learning French as an additional language in Canadian French immersion programs. We examined the direct effect of French syntactic awareness on French reading comprehension as well as the indirect effects mediated through French word reading and French vocabulary. We further examined the extent to which English syntactic awareness contributed to French reading comprehension through cross-language transfer, again considering both the direct effect and the indirect effects through French word reading and French vocabulary. Mediation analyses indicated that, within French, the relationship between French syntactic awareness and French reading comprehension was fully mediated by both French word reading and French vocabulary. In contrast, English syntactic awareness contributed directly to French reading comprehension. Finally, French word reading partially mediated the relationship between English syntactic awareness and French reading comprehension. Our study suggests that children who learn French as an additional language rely on word reading and vocabulary, in addition to French syntactic awareness, to comprehend French texts. Given that English is French immersion children’s stronger language, they use English syntactic awareness to support French reading comprehension both directly and indirectly through French word reading. © 2023 by the authors."
"Introduction: Cleft lip and palate (CL/P) are among the most common congenital abnormalities. The purpose of the present study was to review the literature relating to the quality of life (QoL) in young patients with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) and to identify the specific aspect of QoL in young patients with CL/P that is mostly affected. Other associated variables within studies that may have an impact on QoL were also identified. Materials and Methods: Systematic searches of PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases were conducted. Independent reviewers screened the title, abstract and full texts according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles published in English from January 2012 to March 2022 reporting the QoL of non-syndromic young patients aged 7–18 years with CL/P were included. Review articles and articles reporting the psychological adjustment of parents or other family members with CL/P were excluded. Results: 975 publications were identified, of which 20 studies met our inclusion criteria. The majority of studies reported that the CL/P condition has a negative impact on the QoL. Psychological health, functional well-being, social-emotional well-being and school environment are domains that are affected. Compared with typically developing young patients, those with CL/P had lower QoL scores even though QoL was assessed using different instruments across studies. The impact of CL/P on overall QoL scores varied by age but not gender or cleft type. Conclusion: Our reviews had shown the presence of CL/P negatively affects the QoL of young patients. Psychological health is the most affected QoL domain. Understanding the impacted domain will help in planning and delivering better health care for individuals with CL/P and reducing the stigma commonly associated with CL/P. Future studies should target intervention on psychological health and consider resilience factors towards positive adjustment. © 2023, Malaysian Medical Association. All rights reserved."
"Magnesium, an essential cation for numerous cellular processes, is a major component of bone. However, its relationship with the risk of fractures is still uncertain. The present systematic review and meta-analysis aim to investigate the impact of serum Mg on the risk of incident fractures. A systematic search was conducted using several databases including PubMed/Medline and Scopus from inception to 24 May 2022, including observational studies investigating serum Mg and the incidence of fractures considered as outcomes. Abstract and full-text screenings, data extractions, and risk of bias assessments were conducted by two investigators independently. Any inconsistencies were resolved by consensus with a third author. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was used to assess the study quality/risk of bias. Among 1332 records initially screened, 16 were retrieved as full-texts; of them, four papers were included in the systematic review with a total of 119,755 participants. We found that lower serum Mg concentrations were associated with a significantly higher risk of incident fractures (RR = 1.579; 95%CI: 1.216–2.051; p = 0.001; I2 = 46.9%). Our systematic review with meta-analysis suggests a strong association of serum Mg concentrations with incident fractures. Further research is needed to confirm our results among other populations and to assess whether serum Mg is potentially relevant in the prevention of fractures, which continue to increase and represent a significant health burden due to the associated disability. © 2023 by the authors."
"Question-asking is a critical aspect of human communications. Yet, little is known about the reasons that lead people to ask questions, which questions are considered better than others, or what cognitive mechanisms allow the ability to ask informative questions. Here, we take a first step towards investigating human question-asking. We do so by an exploratory data-driven analysis of the questions asked by Akinator, a popular online game of a genie who asks questions to guess the character that the user is thinking of. We propose that the Akinator’s question-asking process may be viewed as a reflection of how humans ask questions. We conduct an exploratory data analysis to examine different strategies for the Akinator’s question-asking process, ranging from mathematical algorithms to gamification-based considerations, by analyzing complete games and individual questions. Furthermore, we use topic-modelling techniques to explore the topics of the Akinator’s inquiries and map similar questions into clusters. Overall, we find surprising aspects of the specificity and types of questions generated by the Akinator game, that may be driven by the gamification characteristics of the game. In addition, we find coherent topics that the Akinator retrieves from when generating questions. Our results highlight commonalities in the strategies for question-asking used by people and by the Akinator. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Perceived injustice (PI) is a multidimensional appraisal cognition comprising the severity of loss consequent to injury, blame, a sense of unfairness, and/or irreparability of loss. PI gained increasing interest in pain research since it potentially contributes to the experience and burden of (chronic) pain. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to determine the prevalence of PI and factors associated with PI in people with pain. Study Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis. Methods: Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase were screened for cross-sectional or cohort studies encompassing human patients who were diagnosed with a condition causing pain and reported prevalence rates for PI and/or associations between a factor and PI. Meta-analyses were carried out, and subgroup analyses were undertaken based on the methodological quality of the studies, the type of pain population, and whether the outcome measure was valid or not in case of heterogeneity (P < 0.05). Results: Fifty-four studies were found eligible. The prevalence of PI ranged from 23% to 77% (I2 = 99%, P < 0.001). Association with PI, assessed using the Injustice Experienced Questionnaire, were found with pain catastrophizing (pooled Pearson’s r [rp ] = 0.66 [0.64, 0.69], P < 0.00001), posttraumatic stress (rp = 0.63 [0.59, 0.67], P < 0.00001), anger (rp = 0.59 [0.49, 0.67], P < 0.00001), anxiety (rp = 0.59 [0.52, 0.64], P < 0.00001), pain acceptance (rp =-0.59 [-0.66,-0.49], P < 0.00001), depressive symptoms (rp = 0.57 [0.52, 0.60], P < 0.00001), kinesiophobia (rp = 0.57 [0.50, 0.64], P < 0.00001), academic functioning (rp =-0.54 [-0.65,-0.41], P < 0.00001), disability (rp = 0.53 [0.47, 0.59], P < 0.00001), emotional functioning (rp =-0.52 [-0.64,-0.39], P < 0.00001), pain interference (rp = 0.49 [0.35, 0.60], P < 0.00001), state anger (rp = 0.48 [0.41, 0.54], P < 0.00001), mental functioning (rp =-0.48 [-0.57,-0.38], P < 0.00001), symptoms of central sensitization (rp = 0.47 [0.39, 0.55], P < 0.00001), social functioning (rp =-0.47 [-0.60,-0.31], P < 0.00001), and physical functioning (rp =-0.43 [-0.53,-0.33], P < 0.00001), pain perceptions (rp = 0.40 [0.40, 0.64], P < 0.00001), trait anger (rp = 0.40 [0.29, 0.49], P < 0.00001), pain intensity (rp = 0.37 [0.33, 0.42], P < 0.00001), and anger inhibition (rp = 0.35 [0.26, 0.43], P < 0.00001). Limitations: Some articles had to be excluded due to the absence of a full-text version. The findings can largely be applied to developed and high-income countries, but further research is needed in developing countries. Also, no validated cutoff values were available for the National Institutes of Health to determine the methodological quality of the included studies. Lastly, high heterogeneity was observed in many of the performed analyses. However, this was addressed by performing subgroup analyses, which could decrease heterogeneity in some cases. Conclusions: The prevalence of PI was ≥ 33% in 75% of the studies indicating that PI is important to consider in people with pain. There is evidence for the association of PI with psychological, pain, and quality of life characteristics in people with pain. The associations of PI with personal, injury, and recovery characteristics were overall not significant or negligible. © 2023, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

"Background HIV testing services (HTS) are the first steps in reaching the UNAIDS 95-95-95 goals to achieve and maintain low HIV incidence. Evaluating the effectiveness of different demand creation interventions to increase uptake of efficient and effective HTS is useful to prioritize limited programmatic resources. This review was undertaken to inform World Health Organization (WHO) 2019 HIV testing guidelines and assessed the research question, “Which demand creation strategies are effective for enhancing uptake of HTS?” focused on populations globally. Methods and findings The following electronic databases were searched through September 28, 2021: PubMed, PsycInfo, Cochrane CENTRAL, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science Core Collection, EMBASE, and Global Health Database; we searched IAS and AIDS conferences. We systematically searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any demand creation intervention (incentives, mobilization, counseling, tailoring, and digital interventions) to either a control or other demand creation intervention and reported HTS uptake. We pooled trials to evaluate categories of demand creation interventions using random-effects models for meta-analysis and assessed study quality with Cochrane’s risk of bias 1 tool. This study was funded by the WHO and registered in Prospero with ID CRD42022296947. We screened 10,583 records and 507 conference abstracts, reviewed 952 full texts, and included 124 RCTs for data extraction. The majority of studies were from the African (N = 53) and Americas (N = 54) regions. We found that mobilization (relative risk [RR]: 2.01, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.30, 3.09], p < 0.05; risk difference [RD]: 0.29, 95% CI [0.16, 0.43], p < 0.05, N = 4 RCTs), couple-oriented counseling (RR: 1.98, 95% CI [1.02, 3.86], p < 0.05; RD: 0.12, 95% CI [0.03, 0.21], p < 0.05, N = 4 RCTs), peer-led interventions (RR: 1.57, 95% CI [1.15, 2.15], p < 0.05; RD: 0.18, 95% CI [0.06, 0.31], p < 0.05, N = 10 RCTs), motivation-oriented counseling (RR: 1.53, 95% CI [1.07, 2.20], p < 0.05; RD: 0.17, 95% CI [0.00, 0.34], p < 0.05, N = 4 RCTs), short message service (SMS) (RR: 1.53, 95% CI [1.09, 2.16], p < 0.05; RD: 0.11, 95% CI [0.03, 0.19], p < 0.05, N = 5 RCTs), and conditional fixed value incentives (RR: 1.52, 95% CI [1.21, 1.91], p < 0.05; RD: 0.15, 95% CI [0.07, 0.22], p < 0.05, N = 11 RCTs) all significantly and importantly (≥50% relative increase) increased HTS uptake and had medium risk of bias. Lottery-based incentives and audio-based interventions less importantly (25% to 49% increase) but not significantly increased HTS uptake (medium risk of bias). Personal invitation letters and personalized message content significantly but not importantly (<25% increase) increased HTS uptake (medium risk of bias). Reduced duration counseling had comparable performance to standard duration counseling (low risk of bias) and video-based interventions were comparable or better than in-person counseling (medium risk of bias). Heterogeneity of effect among pooled studies was high. This study was limited in that we restricted to randomized trials, which may be systematically less readily available for key populations; additionally, we compare only pooled estimates for interventions with multiple studies rather than single study estimates, and there was evidence of publication bias for several interventions. Conclusions Mobilization, couple- and motivation-oriented counseling, peer-led interventions, conditional fixed value incentives, and SMS are high-impact demand creation interventions and should be prioritized for programmatic consideration. Reduced duration counseling and video-based interventions are an efficient and effective alternative to address staffing shortages. Investment in demand creation activities should prioritize those with undiagnosed HIV or ongoing HIV exposure. Selection of demand creation interventions must consider risks and benefits, context-specific factors, feasibility and sustainability, country ownership, and universal health coverage across disease areas.

"The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak impacted health care. We investigated its impact on the time to referral and diagnosis for symptomatic cancer patients in The Netherlands. We performed a national retrospective cohort study utilizing primary care records linked to The Netherlands Cancer Registry. For patients with symptomatic colorectal, lung, breast, or melanoma cancer, we manually explored free and coded texts to determine the durations of the primary care (IPC) and secondary care (ISC) diagnostic intervals during the first COVID-19 wave and pre-COVID-19. We found that the median IPC duration increased for colorectal cancer from 5 days (Interquartile Range (IQR) 1–29 days) pre-COVID-19 to 44 days (IQR 6–230, p < 0.01) during the first COVID-19 wave, and for lung cancer, the duration increased from 15 days (IQR) 3–47) to 41 days (IQR 7–102, p < 0.01). For breast cancer and melanoma, the change in IPC duration was negligible. The median ISC duration only increased for breast cancer, from 3 (IQR 2–7) to 6 days (IQR 3–9, p < 0.01). For colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma, the median ISC durations were 17.5 (IQR (9–52), 18 (IQR 7–40), and 9 (IQR 3–44) days, respectively, similar to pre-COVID-19 results. In conclusion, for colorectal and lung cancer, the time to primary care referral was substantially prolonged during the first COVID-19 wave. In such crises, targeted primary care support is needed to maintain effective cancer diagnosis. © 2023 by the authors."

"Thresholding is a prerequisite for many computer vision algorithms. By suppressing the background in an image, one can remove unnecessary information and shift one’s focus to the object of inspection. We propose a two-stage histogram-based background suppression technique based on the chromaticity of the image pixels. The method is unsupervised, fully automated, and does not need any training or ground-truth data. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using a printed circuit assembly (PCA) board dataset and the University of Waterloo skin cancer dataset. Accurately performing background suppression in PCA boards facilitates the inspection of digital images with small objects of interest, such as text or microcontrollers on a PCA board. The segmentation of skin cancer lesions will help doctors to automate skin cancer detection. The results showed a clear and robust background–foreground separation across various sample images under different camera or lighting conditions, which the naked implementation of existing state-of-the-art thresholding methods could not achieve. © 2023 by the authors."
"This study utilized computational techniques for a reliable analysis of discourse. These techniques were adopted to analyze the progress of Saudi social change in terms of women’s empowerment within the Saudi transformation program. The data from open source 2021–2022 Saudi newspaper archives were automatically crawled using cutting-edge computational techniques and structured according to the sections of the Saudi newspapers: front page, economy, international, sports, society, culture and religion. The analysis was based on computing the minimally uneven distribution of the relative frequencies of the occurrence of the central word (the Arabic forms of woman and women) from the years 2021 to 2022. This produced two samples of text data, each of which represented the respective years. Calculating the normalized and adjusted frequencies of the central word from each section in the data from each year was important to avoid unbalanced absolute frequencies in the qualitative analysis stage. In addition, dispersion measures showed that the amount of variance in terms of the lexical dispersion of the central word was not high. The observable facts from the quantitative analysis produced a more accurate observational sample of citations, which we qualitatively analyzed. The results of the latter showed a considerable ascending change in favor of empowering women as a consequence of Saudi Vision 2030. © 2023 by the authors."
"Migration patterns have rapidly changed in Australia and elsewhere, which have contributed to increasingly culturally and linguistically diverse societies. This requires healthcare sectors to provide professional interpreter services for patients with a language barrier to eliminate healthcare disparities. This integrative review aimed to investigate the impact of professional interpreter services on hospital care outcomes and the associated cost of service provision. A systematic search of five databases was conducted for peer-reviewed articles from January 1996 to December 2020. Data were extracted for the hospital setting, intervention, population, study design, outcomes and key findings. Following the PRISMA guidelines, full-text screening identified 37 articles that were analysed and included. Communication quality, hospital care outcomes and hospital costs were the three main themes identified. Closing the language gap should be a primary consideration to prevent adverse events that affect patient safety and the standard of care in hospitals. The findings of this review indicate the provision of professional interpreter services can enhance hospital care for linguistically diverse patients by improving patient–provider communication. To gain insight into the changing patterns on the outcomes of medical care, further research requires efforts by the hospital administrative system to document complete records of service usage. © 2023 by the authors."
"Landmark trials (Z0011 and AMAROS) have demonstrated that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) can be safely omitted in patients with breast cancer and 1–2 positive sentinel nodes. Extrapolating from these and other cardinal studies such as NSABP B-04, guidelines state that patients with 1–2 needle biopsy-proven positive lymph nodes undergoing upfront surgery can have sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the literature to identify studies examining the direct application of SLNB in such patients. EMBASE and Ovid MEDLINE were searched from inception to 3 May 2022. Studies including patients with nodal involvement confirmed on pre-operative biopsy and undergoing SLNB were identified. Studies with neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded. Search resulted in 2518 records, of which 68 full-text studies were reviewed, ultimately yielding only 2 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Both studies used targeted axillary surgery (TAS) with pre-operative localization of the biopsy-proven positive node in addition to standard SLNB techniques. In a non-randomized single-center prospective study, Lee et al. report no regional recurrences in patients undergoing TAS or ALND, and no difference in distant recurrence or mortality at 5 years. In the prospective multicenter TAXIS trial by Webber et al., the median number of positive nodes retrieved with TAS in patients undergoing upfront surgery was 2 (1, 4 IQR). Within the subset of patients who underwent subsequent ALND, 61 (70.9%) had additional positive nodes, with 26 (30.2%) patients having ≥4 additional positive nodes. Our review demonstrates that there is limited direct evidence for SLNB alone in clinically node-positive patients undergoing upfront surgery. Available data suggest a high proportion of patients with residual disease in this setting. While the totality of the data, mostly indirect evidence, suggests SLNB alone may be safe, we call on clinicians and researchers to prospectively collect data on this patient population to better inform decision-making. © 2023 by the authors."

"When gender is brought into concerns about older people, the emphasis often lies on stereotypes connected to older women, and few comparative studies have been conducted pertaining to the representation of the intersection between older age and gender in fiction. This article argues that not only children’s literature, traditionally considered to be a carrier of ideology, plays a large part in the target readership’s age socialization, but so do young adult and adult fiction. In a large corpus of 41 Dutch books written for different ages, the representation of older men and women is studied through the verbs, grammatical possessions and adjectives associated with the relevant fictional characters, which were extracted from the texts through the computational method of dependency parsing. Older adult characters featured most frequently in fiction for adults, where, more so than in the books for younger readers, they are depicted as being prone to illness, experiencing the effects of a deteriorating body and having a limited social network. In the books for children, little to no association between older adulthood and mortality was found in the data. Ageist stereotypes pertaining to both genders were found throughout the corpus. In terms of characterization, male older adults are associated more with physicality, including matters of illness and mobility, while character traits and emotions show up in a more varied manner in connection to female older characters. © 2023 by the author."
"The Future Design (FD) workshop (FDWS) is a discussion framework based on FD. The aim of FD is to activate a human trait called futurability, considering the preferences of future generations. Previous FD prac-tices with the theme of policy-making in local govern-ments have demonstrated this possibility. However, creating concrete proposals might depend on workshop participants’ abilities and emotions to perceive future society. By comparing two case studies, this study examines the effects of a method for utilizing a causal loop diagram (CLD), a tool for systems think-ing, in FDWS to systematically draw the future society and activate discussions among the participants. CLD is a qualitative system model that helps identify the factors that lead to systemic problems and analyze the guidelines for solving them. Its effects on the performance of the FDWS discussion activity are evalu-ated. They are quantified by text mining analysis using participants’ remark records. Two case studies con-ducted at policy-making workshops in the local gov-ernments of Japan are examined. One is the FDWS in Kyoto City which adopted the proposed CLD utilization method, and the other is the FDWS in Suita City without CLD. The comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed method makes the discussion live-lier, less divergent, and more developed in the FDWS. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd. the Creative Commons Attribu."
"The Investor Sentiment Index (ISI) is widely regarded as a useful measure to gauge the overall mood of the market. Investor panic may result in contagion, causing failure in financial markets. Market participants widely use the ISI indicator to understand price fluctuations and related opportunities. As a result, it is imperative to systematically review the compiled literature on the subject. In addition to reviewing past studies on the ISI, this paper attempts a bibliometric analysis (BA) to understand any related publications. We systematically review over 100 articles and carry out a BA on a set of information based on the publication year, the journal, the countries/territories, the deployed statistical tools and techniques, a citation analysis, and a content analysis. This analysis further strengthens the study by establishing interesting findings. Most articles use the Baker and Wurgler index and text-based sentiment analysis. However, an Internet-search-based ISI was also used in a few of the studies. The results reveal the lack of direct measures or a robust qualitative approach in constructing the ISI. The findings further indicate a vast research gap in emerging economies, such as India’s. This study had no limit on the period for inclusion and exclusion. We believe that our current work is a seminal study, jointly involving a systematic literature review and BA, that will enormously facilitate academicians and practitioners working on the ISI. © 2022 by the authors."
"Electronic commerce appeared as a new way of managing businesses in the digital era. However, it has also been accelerated by the recent pandemic situation. Retailers had to find new strategies of reaching customers in the online environment. Thus, concepts such as multi-channel and omni-channel retailing have gained the attention of both retailers and researchers in this field. This paper aims at using a text-mining approach in order to reveal the researchers focus on this theme in a period that also precedes and covers the COVID-19 pandemic. The research methodology follows five steps that are necessary in order to obtain a relevant collection of documents that will further provide the content to be analyzed. These steps refer to: (1) Creating the database of documents for analysis purposes; (2) identifying geographic areas for separating the collection’s documents; (3) framing a thematic dictionary of descriptors; (4) exploring the text using text mining approach; and (5) correspondence analysis. The discussion of the main findings is constructed starting with the geographic and the temporal distribution of documents and the design of a thematic dictionary of descriptors. Then, exploring the content of the documents provides information on the frequency of descriptors and reveals clusters of descriptors along with a link analysis. All of them are presented separately on geographic regions. Finally, the correspondence analysis of descriptors versus years provides the proximity maps and reveals the preferred topics and less approached themes. Among the main findings, one can highlight: (1) The greatest contributor in terms of documents related to the theme of interest is the United States; (2) a higher number of connections (and stronger) among descriptors for America as compared to the other two regions; (3) some categories of descriptors are specific to a particular year, which means that there are different themes under the researchers lens depending on the period; (4) the most frequently used descriptors are included in the following categories from the dictionary: Online retail environment and Consumer behavior, regardless of the region. In the end of this paper, research limitations and guidelines for future research are elaborated. © 2022 by the authors."
"Previous studies examining the impact of heritage tourism have focused on specific ecological, economic, political, or cultural impacts. Research focused on the extent to which heritage tourism fosters host communities' participation and enhances their capacity to flourish and support long-term health and wellbeing is lacking. This systematic review assessed the impact of heritage tourism on sustainable community development, as well as the health and wellbeing of local communities. Studies were included if they: (i) were conducted in English; (ii) were published between January 2000 and March 2021; (iii) used qualitative and/or quantitative methods; (iv) analysed the impact of heritage tourism on sustainable community development and/or the health and wellbeing of local host communities; and (v) had a full-text copy available. The search identified 5292 articles, of which 102 articles met the inclusion criteria. The included studies covering six WHO regions (Western Pacific, African, Americas, South-East Asia, European, Eastern Mediterranean, and multiple regions). These studies show that heritage tourism had positive and negative impacts on social determinants of health. Positive impacts included economic gains, rejuvenation of culture, infrastructure development, and improved social services. However, heritage tourism also had deleterious effects on health, such as restrictions placed on local community participation and access to land, loss of livelihood, relocation and/or fragmentation of communities, increased outmigration, increases in crime, and erosion of culture. Thus, while heritage tourism may be a poverty-reducing strategy, its success depends on the inclusion of host communities in heritage tourism governance, decision-making processes, and access to resources and programs. Future policymakers are encouraged to adopt a holistic view of benefits along with detriments to sustainable heritage tourism development. Additional research should consider the health and wellbeing of local community groups engaged in heritage tourism. Protocol PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018114681. © 2023 Brooks et al.

"Background: Opportunities for social connection between generations in the UK have diminished over the last few decades because of changes in the way that we live and work. The decline in communal spaces such as libraries, youth clubs and community centres mean that there are fewer opportunities to meet and mix socially with other generations outside our own families. Increased working hours, improved technology, changes in family patterns, relationship breakdowns within families and migration are also believed to be contributory factors to generation segregation. There are many potential economic, social and political impacts of generations living separate and parallel lives, for example, higher health and social care costs, an undermining of trust between generations reduced social capital, a reliance on the media to form understanding of others’ viewpoints and higher levels of anxiety and loneliness. Intergenerational programmes and activities can take many forms and are delivered in many settings. Evidence suggests that intergenerational activity can have a positive impact on participants, for example, in reducing loneliness and exclusion for both older people and children and young people, improving mental health, increasing mutual understanding and addressing important issues such as ageism, housing and care. There are currently no other EGMs that exist that address this type of intervention; however, it would complement existing EGMs addressing child welfare. Objectives: To identify, appraise and bring together the evidence on the use of intergenerational practice, to answer the following specific research questions:. What is the volume, nature and diversity of research on, and evaluation of, intergenerational practice and learning? What approaches have been used to deliver intergenerational activities and programmes that may be relevant to providing such services during and in the subsequent recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic? What promising intergenerational activities and programmes have been developed and are being used but have not yet been subject to formal evaluation?. Search Methods: We searched MEDLINE (via OvidSp), EMBASE (via OvidSp), PsycINFO (via OvidSp), CINAHL (via EBSCOHost), Social Policy and Practice (via OvidSp), Health Management Information Consortium (via OvidSp), Ageline (via EBSCOhost), ASSIA (via ProQuest), Social Science Citations Index (via Web of Science), ERIC (via EBSCOhost), Community Care Inform Children, Research in Practice for Children, ChildData (via Social Policy and Practice), the Campbell Library, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the CENTRAL database between 22 and 30 July 2021. We searched for additional grey literature via the Conference Proceedings Citation Index (via Web of Science) and ProQuest Dissertation & Theses Global and via relevant organisation websites, for example, Age UK, Age International, the Centre for Ageing Better, Barnado's, Children's Commission, UNICEF, Generations Working Together, the Intergenerational Foundation, Linking Generations and The Beth Johnson Foundation) and the Ottawa initiative called Older Adults and Students for Intergenerational support. Selection Criteria: Any intervention that brings older and younger people together with the purpose of interacting to achieve positive health and/or social and/or educational outcomes from any study design including systematic reviews, randomised controlled studies, observational studies, surveys and qualitative studies are included. The titles and abstracts, and later full texts, of records identified by the search methods were screened against inclusion criteria by two independent reviewers. Data Collection and Analysis: Data extraction was undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second with any inconsistencies identified and resolved through discussion. The data extraction tool was developed on EPPI reviewer and was modified and tested through stakeholder and advisor consultation, and piloting of the process. The tool was informed by the research question and the structure of the map. We did not undertake quality appraisal of the included studies. Main Results: Our searches identified 12,056 references, after screening 500 research articles were included in the evidence gap map conducted across 27 countries. We identified 26 systematic reviews, 236 quantitative comparative studies (of which 38 were randomised controlled trials), 227 were qualitative studies (or had a qualitative element), 105 were observational studies (or had elements of observational methods) and 82 used a mixed methods approach. The outcomes reported in the research cover mental health (n = 73), physical health (n = 62), attainment and knowledge (n = 165), agency (n = 174), mental wellbeing (n = 224), loneliness and social isolation (n = 54), attitudes towards the other generation (n = 283), intergenerational interactions (n = 196), peer interactions (n = 30) and health promotion (n = 23) and including mutual outcomes such as the impact on community (n = 37) and perceptions on the sense of community (n = 43). Gaps in the evidence that were identified include: research that reports on mutual, societal and community outcomes of intergenerational interventions; more research on interventions classified as levels 1–4 and level 7 on the Intergenerational Engagement Scale, mental health, loneliness, social isolation, peer interactions, physical health and health promotion outcomes in children and young people; health promotion in older people; outcomes centred on care giver wellbeing, mental health and attitudes; economic outcomes; process outcomes and adverse or unexpected outcomes. Authors’ Conclusions: Whilst a substantional amount of research on intergenerational interventions has been identified in this EGM, as well as the gaps identified above, there is a need to explore promising interventions not yet formally evaluated. Research on this topic is gradually increasing, and systematic reviews will be important to determine how and why interventions are or are not beneficial. However, the primary research needs to build more cohesively so that the findings can be comparable and avoid research waste. The EGM presented here will nevertheless be a useful resource for decision-makers allowing them to explore the evidence with regard to the different interventions that may be relevant to their population needs and the settings or resources available to them. © 2023 The Authors.

"To describe process knowledge at the watershed scale, hydrologists commonly refer to a ‘perceptual model’, an expert summary of the watershed and its runoff processes often supported by field observations. Perceptual models are often presented as a schematic figure, although such a figure will necessarily simplify the hydrologist's complex mental model. In this paper, our aim was to understand what constitutes a visual expert summary of watershed process knowledge, and to evaluate how perceptual models could be used to share hydrological process information at larger scales. To do so, we conducted a systematic review of the literature and found 63 perceptual model figures. We counted and categorized the stores and fluxes in each figure using a taxonomic classification and quantified a variety of figure attributes including spatial or temporal zonation, inclusion of vegetation, soils, topographical and geological data and consideration of uncertainty. Our analysis showed that a typical figure has 1 surface flux, 4 subsurface fluxes, 3–4 subsurface stores and 0–1 channel stores; 28 out of 63 figures use sub-figures to show temporal dynamics (e.g., wet/dry conditions), and 12 out of 63 show spatial zones. Perceptual model figures, therefore, provide a concise summary of watershed processes with a complexity comparable to that of many conceptual hydrological models. However, only four figures showed any information on uncertainty or knowledge gaps. We recommend that perceptual figure value could be easily increased by consistent captioning of figures to assist automated search, and wider use of standard figure annotations such as legends and scale markings to ensure that information is fully conveyed to the user. If perceptual figures are proposed as a primary method for sharing process information, the hydrological community should consider how to link more detailed text descriptions to figures, and how to represent process uncertainty. © 2023 The Authors.

"Antipsychotic-induced akathisia (AIA) is a movement disorder characterized by a subjective feeling of inner restlessness or nervousness with an irresistible urge to move, resulting in repetitive movements of the limbs and torso, while taking antipsychotics (APs). In recent years, there have been some associative genetic studies of the predisposition to the development of AIA. Objective: The goal of our study was to review the results of associative genetic and genome-wide studies and to systematize and update the knowledge on the genetic predictors of AIA in patients with schizophrenia (Sch). Methods: We searched full-text publications in PubMed, Web of Science, Springer, Google Scholar, and e-Library databases from 1977 to 2022. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) quality scale was used for the critical selection of the studies. Results: We identified 37 articles, of which 3 were included in the review. Thus, the C allele of rs1800498 (59414 C>T) and the A allele of rs1800497 (17316 G>A) (TaqIA) from the DRD2 gene as well as the TT genotype rs13212041 (77461407 C>T) from the HTR1B gene were found to be associated with AIA. Conclusions: Uncovering the genetic biomarkers of AIA may provide a key to developing a strategy for the personalized prevention and treatment of this adverse neurological drug reaction of APs in patients with Sch in real clinical practice. © 2023 by the authors."
"Present-day, interdisciplinary research is increasing in social network-related applications, and it is a daily routine activity in every human life. So, sentiment analysis (SA) based on opinion mining is the most sophisticated concept in the well-known social network environment. Different machine learning methods were implemented to extract different text label features in SA, and all of those methods can detect whether a given text is positive or negative based on the text features. Analysis of sentiment has been suffering from inaccuracies while using machine learning and sentiment-based lexical methods dependent on domain-specific problems. Multi-class SA is an expensive task where memory, label samples, and other parameters are insufficient. So, we propose and implement a novel hybrid model which is a combination of ResNeXt and recurrent neural framework (NH-ResNeXt-RNF) to explore multi-class sentiment from textual features. This framework investigates the polarity of words connected to a specific domain across the entire dataset and eliminates noisy data in an unsupervised manner using pre-processing. Optimization is required to perform efficient multi-class classification to reduce the effort associated with annotation for multi-class SA via unsupervised learning. The proposed model performance is evaluated on two data sets namely: Amazon and Twitter. We increase the accuracy of the sentiment of polarity on each sentence present in the data set. Experimental results of the proposed approach give better and more efficient multi-class (positive, negative, very positive, neutral and highly negative) domain-specific sentiment than traditional approaches related to supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised domains. The proposed hybrid model accuracy is 96.5% and 95.37% for Amazon and Twitter datasets respectively. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by IOP Publishing Ltd"
"The aim of the study is to show whether it is possible to predict infectious disease outbreaks early, by using machine learning. This study was carried out following the guidelines of the Cochrane Collaboration and the meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology and the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The suitable bibliography on PubMed/Medline and Scopus was searched by combining text, words, and titles on medical topics. At the end of the search, this systematic review contained 75 records. The studies analyzed in this systematic review demonstrate that it is possible to predict the incidence and trends of some infectious diseases; by combining several techniques and types of machine learning, it is possible to obtain accurate and plausible results. © 2023 by the authors."
"(1) Background: Iron deficiency (ID) is an important adverse prognostic marker in patients with heart failure (HF); however, it is unclear whether intravenous iron replacement reduces cardiovascular mortality in this patient group. Here, we estimate the effect of intravenous iron replacement therapy on hard clinical outcomes following the publication of IRONMAN, the largest trial in this field. (2) Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, prospectively registered with PROSPERO and reported according to PRISMA guidelines, we searched PubMed and Embase for randomized controlled trials investigating intravenous iron replacement in patients with HF and co-existing ID. The primary outcome was cardiovascular mortality and secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality, hospitalizations for HF and a combination of the primary outcome and hospitalizations for HF. (3) Results: A total of 1671 items were identified and after removal of duplicates we screened titles and abstracts of 1202 records. Some 31 studies were identified for full-text review and 12 studies were included in the final review. The odds ratio (OR) for cardiovascular death using a random effects model was 0.85 (95% CI 0.69 to 1.04) and for all-cause mortality it was 0.83 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.15). There was a significant reduction in hospitalizations for HF (OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.69) and the combination of hospitalizations for HF and cardiovascular death (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.5 to 0.85). (4) Conclusions: This review supports the use of IV iron replacement reducing hospitalization rates for HF, however more research is required to determine the effect on cardiovascular mortality and to identify the patient population most likely to benefit. © 2023 by the authors."
"This study set out to better understand virtual consumerism (VC) by applying natural language processing (NLP) methods for sentiment and content analyses. A total of 318 articles related to VC were identified on theguardian.com Web site and analyzed by text mining methodology. A thematic, content analysis using the Leximancer program was performed to explore VC as a concept, and its related concepts and concept associations. For the purposes of ""deep-dive insights,""further content and sentiment analyses were performed with MonkeyLearn and valence aware dictionary for sentiment reasoning. This triangulation in methodology enabled a comprehensive unstructured qualitative data analysis. The study identified key themes that characterize and define VC. It uncovered that, although there is predominantly positive sentiment toward VC reported in The Guardian online articles, negative sentiment also exists, presenting challenges for the industry to maneuver. The findings reveal that in the context of VC, a virtual experience is also a social experience in a virtual space, which is becoming and evolving. There are certain industries and sectors that are embracing VC, such as marketing, advertising and public relations, software development/IT, art/design, and entertainment, as well as science/technology. Some sectors and industries are experiencing challenges, such as security/law enforcement and medical, and hence display negative sentiment toward VC. Overall, this study presents a working definition of VC, a synopsis of the state of VC, and highlights areas for potential research to further our understanding of this phenomenon. It contributes to an improved understanding of VC for the industry and academia, and provides impetus for future studies focused on the emergent VC-relevant conceptual relationships.

"The protection of one’s home and ensuring the safety of one’s family have been deep-rooted concerns throughout time and in all cultures. Ānzhái 安宅 (“pacifying one’s residence”) rituals can be traced to ancient China and are still practiced in contemporary China. In this study, we will focus on the Fóshuō ānzhái shénzhòu jīng 佛說安宅神呪經 (AZSZJ; T.21, No. 1394), one of the extant Buddhist scriptures dealing with home protection. There have been (at least) two lines of transmission of ānzhái scriptures and on the basis of internal and external evidence, we project the compilation of the extant version of this text to include the late 6th century and mid 7th century and show that the scripture—in earlier catalogues labeled as “fake”—entered the Buddhist canon on the basis of a mistake or confusion by Míng Quán when he recorded it in his Dà-Zhōu kāndìng zhòngjīng mùlù 大周刊定眾經目錄. The main part of the study consists of an annotated translation of AZSZJ and a preliminary analysis of the difficult terminology appearing in parts of the text. In the last part, we discuss some aspects of the text’s traditional Chinese and Buddhist elements and how they were skillfully combined in order to make the overall text attractive for the medieval Chinese Buddhist community and to successfully compete with other contemporary ritual practices concerned with the safety of one’s home. © 2023 by the authors."
"Preterm birth is associated with weaknesses in reading skills that are usually less severe than those of children with dyslexia. To understand the characteristics of reading processes in preterm children, we adopted a cross-population and multi-modal approach comparing eye movements in reading tasks among three groups: children with preterm birth, children with a diagnosis of dyslexia, and children with typical development. The study involved 78 participants (10.5 years). Eye movements (number and duration of fixations, amplitude and number of saccades, number of regressions) were recorded during the silent reading of two texts; cognitive and reading standardized tasks were also administered. Children with dyslexia had more fixations and more frequent and smaller saccades compared to the preterm group and children with typical development. They also showed more regressions compared to the control group. Preterm children showed shorter fixations compared to the other groups. Cognitive and reading standardized tasks confirmed severe delays in reading in children with dyslexia and some weaknesses in text reading speed and comprehension in preterm children. These results are discussed with reference to candidate mechanisms that underlie reading processes in preterm children and considering possible implications for research. © 2023 by the authors."
"The local structure and density of ternary Fe-C-S liquid alloys have been studied using a combination of in situ X-ray diffraction and absorption experiments between 1 and 5 GPa and 1600–1900 K. The addition of up to 12 at% of carbon (C) to Fe-S liquid alloys does not significantly modify the structure, which is largely controlled by the perturbation to the Fe-Fe network induced by S atoms. The liquid density determined from diffraction and/or absorption techniques allows us to build a non-ideal ternary mixing model as a function of pressure, temperature, and composition in terms of the content of alloying light elements. The composition of the Moon's core is addressed based on this thermodynamic model. Under the assumption of a homogeneous liquid core proposed by two recent Moon models, the sulfur content would be 27–36 wt% or 12–23 wt%, respectively, while the carbon content is mainly limited by the Fe-C-S miscibility gap, with an upper bound of 4.3 wt%. On the other hand, if the core is partially molten, the core temperature is necessarily lower than 1850 K estimated in the text, and the composition of both the inner and outer core would be controlled by aspects of the Fe-C-S phase diagram not yet sufficiently constrained. © 2023.

"Objective: Malnutrition is often underestimated in the context of cancer therapy: the dietary trends initiated by patients after diagnosis are usually neither known to nor evaluated by the medical staff. Here, we propose a combined screening instrument evaluating malnutrition and dietary trends. Methods: The validated screening tool NRS-2002 was combined with a four-item questionnaire assessing whether (1) patients preferred certain foods, (2) avoided certain foods, (3) used dietary supplements or followed a special diet since the time of cancer diagnosis. The screening tool was routinely used by cancer patients in the daily practice of three oncological departments. The presented analysis was performed retrospectively and anonymized. Results: Overall, 102 cancer patients undergoing systemic therapy (CP), 97 undergoing radiation therapy (RP), and 36 head–neck cancer patients (HNP) were screened. The CP cohort showed a higher rate of malnutrition (50.00%) than the HNP (28.13%) or RP (26.80%) cohort. Overall, diet changes were observed in 33.63% of all patients. Avoiding meat, stimulants, or hard and edgy food was often mentioned in free text answers, while patients reported a preference for fruit and vegetables. Nutritional supplements were used by 28.76% of the patients. While dietary changes were common, only 6.64% of the patients mentioned adhering to a specific cancer diet. Conclusion: Malnutrition is still underestimated nowadays. Diet trends, especially avoiding certain foods, are common in cancer patients, while adhering to a specific cancer diet is an exception. Diet trends should be assessed and addressed to avoid or aggravate malnutrition. © 2023 by the authors."
"This study explores how natural language processing (NLP) can supplement content analyses of political documents, particularly the manifestos of political parties. NLP is particularly useful for tasks such as: estimating the similarity between documents, identifying the topics discussed in documents (topic modeling), and sentiment analysis. This study applies each of these techniques to the study of political party manifestos. Document similarity may be used to gain some insight into the way parties change over time and which political parties are successful at bringing attention to their policy agenda. Categorizing text into topics may help objectively categorize and visualize the ideas political parties are discussing. Finally, sentiment analysis has the potential to show each political party’s attitude towards a policy area/topic. This study specifically applies these techniques to the manifestos produced by the political parties of New Zealand, from 1987 to 2017 (a period of significant party system change in New Zealand). It finds that NLP techniques provide valuable insights, although there is a need for significant fine-tuning. © 2023 by the authors."
"The search for definitions is ubiquitous in Sanskrit philosophy. In many texts across traditions, we find philosophers presenting their theories by laying down definitions of key theoretical categories, by testing those definitions, and by refuting competing definitions of the same theoretical categories. Call this the method of definitions. The aim of this essay is to explore a challenge that arises for this method: the paradox of definitions. It arises from the claim that the method of definitions is either (i) redundant because it does not provide us any knowledge that we did not already possess, or (ii) impossible to successfully pursue because it leads to an infinite regress. Neither of these alternatives should be acceptable to the defender of this method. To focus our discussion, I will show how this challenge arose for—and was arguably resolved by—early Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika thinkers active in the first millennium CE and at the very beginning of the second millennium. In response to the paradox of definitions, these Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika thinkers claimed that the purpose of a definition is to remove either metaphysical ignorance about the distinction between theoretically significant kinds or kind-membership, or metalinguistic ignorance about the meaning or the application-conditions of theoretically significant terms. I will show how this discussion helps us to ward off certain misconceptions about the method of definitions in Nyāya-Vaiśeṣika. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Plant-based diets have grown increasingly popular across the globe, mainly for their health and environmental benefits. Several studies have identified a link between plant-based diets and the decreased risk of developing cardiovascular diseases, obesity, and other health issues. We systematically reviewed human interventions to identify the relationship between various plant-based food items and the gut microbiome, alongside the biochemical and anthropometric measurements as secondary findings. The study selection process was completed using the COVIDENCE platform. Overall, 203 studies were identified, of which 101 were chosen for title and abstract screening by two independent authors. Following this process, 78 studies were excluded, and the full texts and the reference lists of the remaining 23 records were reviewed using the review eligibility criteria. A manual search yielded five additional articles. In the end, 12 studies were included in the systematic review. We found evidence for short- to moderate-term beneficial effects of plant-based diets versus conventional diets (duration ≤ 13 months) on gut microbiome composition and biochemical and anthropometric measurements in healthy participants as well as obese, cardiovascular, and rheumatoid arthritis patients. However, contradictory results were observed for Enterobacteriaceae, at the family level, and for Faecalibacterium and Coprococcus, at the genus level, of gut microbiome composition. The relationship between plant-based diets and the gut microbiome, alongside their underlying metabolic and inflammatory effects, remains largely unexplored. Hence more interventional studies are needed to address these questions. © 2023 by the authors."
"Disruptive technologies are related to a country’s competitiveness and international status. Accurately identifying and predicting the trends in disruptive technologies through scientific methods can effectively grasp the dynamics of technological development, adjust the national science and technology strategic layout, and better seize the high ground in international competition. Based on patent text data, this paper uses the improved LDA2Vec model combined with relevant indicators to identify the main topics in disruptive technologies, and predicts and analyzes the development trend through the establishment of an ARIMA model. Taking the energy technology field as an example, the main topics and development trends concerning disruptive technologies in this field are obtained. The study found that ten technologies, including energy storage technology, energy internet management technology, and offshore wind energy technology, are disruptive technologies in the energy technology field, and the development speed of energy storage technology is the fastest. To verify the correctness of the conclusion, this paper compares the results with artificial verification methods such as expert interviews and document verification, and finds that the two are basically consistent, thus verifying the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method. © 2023 by the authors."
"The paper is dedicated to the problematics of the Russian Empire’s military researchers of the Don Host. Within it, it is shown that, due to Don Host’s subordination to the Ministry of War, there were quite a few of such researchers, although in later historiography the attention was drawn predominantly to those of them who were of Cossack descent. Meanwhile, even the most general analysis allows to distinguish 4 groups of Russian Empire’s Don Host military researchers: these are, besides Don Cossacks, the officers who had visited Don before any serious publications on the matter of studying the Don Cossacks, the officers of the General Staff and the officers of the Main Directorate of Cossack Hosts. At the same time, exactly in the case of Cossacks, assigning researchers who had military rank to the category of military researches should be made with outmost caution: a number of Don historians and statisticians (for example, M.Kh. Senyutkin and V.M. Pudavov) did not have military education, did not serve in any combat units and therefore principally had a bad familiarity with military-specific literature, including that about the Don Cossacks. The officers who had visited Don before the publications of any serious researches on the Don Cossacks did try to describe, by their own impressions too, the Cossacks and the Don Host, which were perceived as somewhat of an exotic at the time, filling a lacuna in Russian scientific and publicist prose. The officers of the General Staff had frequently composed their works in preparation of upcoming reformations, or just to inform higher authorities about local statistics, and it is characteristic for their works to be based of statistical science which was taught in Nicholas General Staff Academy. Finally, a number of texts was made by the officers of the Main Directorate of Cossack Hosts, based on presenting materials from the archives, which were also found while performing government assignments. Therefore, somewhat different research methods and themes were characteristic for various categories of Russian Empire’s Don Host military researchers, which were determined by their education and official duties.

"Twitter location inference methods are developed with the purpose of increasing the percentage of geotagged tweets by inferring locations on a non-geotagged dataset. For validation of proposed approaches, these location inference methods are developed on a fully geotagged dataset on which the attached Global Navigation Satellite System coordinates are used as ground truth data. Whilst a substantial number of location inference methods have been developed to date, questions arise pertaining the generalizability of the developed location inference models on a non-geotagged dataset. This paper proposes a high precision location inference method for inferring tweets’ point of origin based on location mentions within the tweet text. We investigate the influence of data selection by comparing the model performance on two datasets. For the first dataset, we use a proportionate sample of tweet sources of a geotagged dataset. For the second dataset, we use a modelled distribution of tweet sources following a non-geotagged dataset. Our results showed that the distribution of tweet sources influences the performance of location inference models. Using the first dataset we outweighed state-of-the-art location extraction models by inferring 61.9%, 86.1% and 92.1% of the extracted locations within 1 km, 10 km and 50 km radius values, respectively. However, using the second dataset our precision values dropped to 45.3%, 73.1% and 81.0% for the same radius values. Copyright: © 2023 Serere et al.

"The article provides an encyclopedia source analysis of “Industry and Technology. Encyclopedia of Industrial Knowledge”, published in the Russian Empire period 1901-1904. The encyclopedia was a complete translation of the German edition with significant additions by Russian scientists in certain areas of technical knowledge. It was in the Russian version of the Encyclopedia that the logical order of books collection was determined, which corresponded to the most advanced technologies characteristic of the XX century beginning. The purpose of this article is to analyze the formation history and development of Russian science and technology, as well as to determine the information potential of the encyclopedia as a historical source. The content of each volume has a huge array of information about scientific and technical developments, major discoveries and current scientific knowledge in a specific historical period. Despite the great attention to the science and technology achievements the past, encyclopedic texts record the aspiration of technological progress to the future, where science and technology will be a solid foundation for the social and cultural progress of Russia. Because of the conducted source analysis of the Encyclopedia, including using the qualitative and quantitative content analysis method, the historical continuity of this technology type as an “automaton” in the Russian history of science and technology was established. Special attention to this type of technology was due to the modern development and achievements in the field of technical sciences, the modern significance automated technology. The significance of the publication under study as a historical source lies in the comprehensive and systematic nature of the materials presented on the history of Russian science and technology.

"Over the past few years, word embeddings and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models have brought better solutions to learning text representations for natural language processing (NLP) and other tasks. Many NLP applications rely on pre-trained text representations, leading to the development of a number of neural network language models for various languages. However, this is not the case for Amharic, which is known to be a morphologically complex and under-resourced language. Usable pre-trained models for automatic Amharic text processing are not available. This paper presents an investigation on the essence of learned text representation for information retrieval and NLP tasks using word embeddings and BERT language models. We explored the most commonly used methods for word embeddings, including word2vec, GloVe, and fastText, as well as the BERT model. We investigated the performance of query expansion using word embeddings. We also analyzed the use of a pre-trained Amharic BERT model for masked language modeling, next sentence prediction, and text classification tasks. Amharic ad hoc information retrieval test collections that contain word-based, stem-based, and root-based text representations were used for evaluation. We conducted a detailed empirical analysis on the usability of word embeddings and BERT models on word-based, stem-based, and root-based corpora. Experimental results show that word-based query expansion and language modeling perform better than stem-based and root-based text representations, and fastText outperforms other word embeddings on word-based corpus. © 2023 by the authors."
"Feature selection and feature extraction have always been of utmost importance owing to their capability to remove redundant and irrelevant features, reduce the vector space size, control the computational time, and improve performance for more accurate classification tasks, especially in text categorization. These feature engineering techniques can further be optimized using optimization algorithms. This paper proposes a similar framework by implementing one such optimization algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), incorporating different feature selection and feature extraction techniques on textual and numerical datasets using four machine learning (ML) models: Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), and Random Forest (RF). The aim is to show the difference in the results achieved on both datasets with the help of comparative analysis. The proposed feature selection and feature extraction techniques assist in enhancing the performance of the machine learning model. This research article considers numerical and text-based datasets for stroke prediction and detecting hate speech, respectively. The text dataset is prepared by extracting tweets consisting of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments from Twitter API. A maximum improvement in accuracy of 10.07% is observed for Random Forest with the TF-IDF feature extraction technique on the application of ACO. Besides, this study also highlights the limitations of text data that inhibit the performance of machine learning models, justifying the difference of almost 18.43% in accuracy compared to that of numerical data. © 2023 by the authors."

"Gluten proteins are known as immunological triggers for inflammation resulting in mucosal lesions in patients with coeliac disease (CD). Adherence to a strict gluten-free diet (GFD) is currently known as the only effective treatment for CD. In this study, we performed a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis on data from previous studies to investigate the association between different gluten doses administered and the risk of CD relapse. Electronic databases were systematically searched to retrieve studies that investigated the response of CD patients to different amounts of gluten intake and evaluated the clinical, serologic, and/or histologic evidence to recognize disease relapse. Study-specific relative risks (RRs) were combined using a random effects model. A total of 440 identified published papers were screened, of which 7 records were selected following full-text reviewing and eligibility assessment for dose-response meta-analysis. According to our analysis, the risk of CD relapse is estimated to be 0.2% (RR: 1.002; 95% CI: 1.001 to 1.004) following the consumption of 6 mg gluten/day, which was increased to 7% (RR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.10), 50% (RR: 1.50; 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.82), 80% (RR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.36 to 2.38), and 100% (RR: 2.00; 95% CI: 1.43 to 2.78) by the daily intake of 150, 881, 1276, and 1505 mg gluten, respectively. Although good adherence to a GFD can adequately control CD-related symptoms, disease relapse might happen even with a very low dose of gluten, and the duration of exposure to gluten is also an important matter. The current literature has substantial limitations, such as relying on the data from just a few countries that were different in terms of the amount of gluten administered, the duration of the challenge, etc. Therefore, more randomized clinical trials using a standardized gluten challenge protocol are needed to confirm the findings of the present study. © 2023 by the authors."
"Introduction Valid and reliable scores from measurement tools to test competency in basic manual wheelchair-service-provision are needed to promote good practice and support capacity building. The International Society of Wheelchair Professionals’ (ISWP) Basic Test Version 1 in English, launched in 2015, is the most frequently used outcome measure tool to test basic manual wheelchair-service-provision knowledge and is part of an international certification process. Despite the wide acceptance and use of the test, its psychometric properties have not yet been established. The objectives of this study were 1) to evaluate the test’s psychometric properties, 2) to develop the test’s Version 2, and 3) to evaluate the content validity of the new version. Methods For Objective 1, methods from the Classical Test Theory were used to obtain items’ difficulty, item discrimination index and domains’ reliability. For Objective 2, a team of experts in wheelchair service delivery and education conducted a systematic qualitative review of the questions’ text and answers and updated them using evidence-based guidelines. For Objective 3, an external team reviewed the clarity, relevance and domain allocation of the developed items using a 4-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistics were used to describe and characterize the results for each objective. Item-content (I-CVI) and Scale-content (S-CVI) validity indexes were calculated to compute content validity. Results For Objective 1, all domains in the test were below the threshold for acceptable internal consistency reliability; 80% of the total test pool (116 items from the total pool of 145) did not meet the thresholds for item difficulty and index of discrimination suggested in the literature. Of the items in the Test, 78% could be responded to intuitively and 66% did not distinguish between test-takers who were knowledgeable in the content area and those who were not. For Objective 2, experts found concerns such as items being grouped in the wrong domain, being repeated, not using person-first language, and using terms inconsistently. Thirty-four (23.4%) items were dropped and 111 (76.5%) were updated. In addition, 61 new items were developed. Members re-categorized the items and proposed a new classification of subdomains. For Objective 3, good agreement between subject-matter experts was found; the S-CVI calculated using the I-CVIs related to item clarity was 84% while using the I-CVIs related to item relevance was 98%. Only 7 items (4.1%) were deemed to be in the wrong domain and 4 items (2.3%) were considered irrelevant and dropped. Conclusion The psychometric evidence in support of ISWP Basic Test Version 1 in English is suboptimal. A new set of items developed by experts in the field has shown excellent content validity. Ongoing assessments will be needed as ISWP Basic Test Version 2 is implemented and monitored. Copyright: © 2023 Burrola-Mendez et al.

"Hypoplastic or hypomineralized enamel defects represent a recurrent reason for consultation within the pediatric population, causing great discomfort due to their aesthetic appearance, as well as their functional limitations. Current conservative dentistry requires minimally invasive treatments in order to treat such defects and provide successful, definitive solutions. A systematic review of the literature has been carried out in accordance with the PRISMA recommendations. A search was carried out in the PubMed, Scopus, SciELO and Web of Science databases, completed with a manual search. The following variables were extracted from the selected studies: author, year, publication journal, type of study, sample, age of the participants and the materials used for its development. From the initial electronic search of the four databases, 282 articles were identified: 34 from PubMed, 240 from Scopus, 0 from SciELO and 8 from Web of Science. After eliminating duplicate articles, a total of 225 remained. After reading the title and abstract, 158 articles were eliminated, leaving 68. Upon reading the full text, the remaining studies were eliminated for not answering the research question or the inclusion criteria, leaving a total of 13 articles. Finally, 12 articles were used to carry out the systematic review. Treatments performed to date with the ICON™ system in pediatric patients have shown good results after their application. Since the variability of diagnostic methods has been observed, new diagnostic and assessment protocols should be created after treatment to objectify their effect on hypoplastic or hypomineralized enamel defects. In the same way, it has been described that treatment provides better results if combined with other opalustre-type or remineralizing materials.

"Pauses act as important acoustic cues to prosodic phrase boundaries. However, the distribution and phonetic characteristics of pauses have not yet been fully described either cross-linguistically or in different genres and speech styles within languages. The current study examines the pausal performance of 24 Czech speakers in two genres of read speech: news reading and poetry reciting. The pause rate and pause duration are related to genre differences, overt and covert text organization, and speech tempo. We found a significant effect of several levels of text organization, including a strong effect of punctuation. This was reflected in both measures of pausal performance. A grammatically informed analysis of a subset of pauses within the smallest units revealed a significant contribution for pause rate only. An effect of tempo was found in poetry reciting at a macro level (speaker averages) but not when pauses were observed individually. Genre differences did not manifest consistently and analogically for the two measures. The findings provide evidence that pausing is used systematically by speakers in read speech to convey not only prosodic phrasing but also text structure, among other things. © 2023 by the authors."
"The trend of E-commerce and online shopping is increasing rapidly. However, it is difficult to know about the quality of items from pictures and videos available on the online stores. Therefore, online stores and independent products reviews sites share user reviews about the products for the ease of buyers to find out the best quality products. The proposed work is about measuring and detecting product quality based on consumers’ attitude in product reviews. Predicting the quality of a product from customers’ reviews is a challenging and novel research area. Natural Language Processing and machine learning methods are popularly employed to identify product quality from customer reviews. Most of the existing research for the product review system has been done using traditional sentiment analysis and opinion mining. Going beyond the constraints of opinion and sentiment, such as a deeper description of the input text, is made possible by utilizing appraisal categories. The main focus of this study is exploiting the quality subcategory of the appraisal framework in order to predict the quality of the product. This paper presents a quality of product-based classification model (named QLeBERT) by combining quality of product-related lexicon, N-grams, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (BiLSTM). In the proposed model, the quality of the product-related lexicon, N-grams, and BERT are employed to generate vectors of words from part of the customers’ reviews. The main contribution of this work is the preparation of the quality of product-related lexicon dictionary based on an appraisal framework and automatically labelling the data accordingly before using them as the training data in the BiLSTM model. The proposed model is evaluated on an Amazon product reviews dataset. The proposed QLeBERT outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models by achieving an F1macro score of 0.91 in binary classification. © 2023 by the authors."
"The growing enthusiasm for STEAM (STEM + Arts) initiatives reflects the rich potential for inquiry and integration between arts and sciences. Biologically informed poetry is an active interdisciplinary area of creation and analysis that requires biologically attuned illustration and translation to retain its STEAM effectiveness across linguistic barriers. Pablo Neruda, Chilean poet and Nobel laureate, was a keen observer and informed scholar who wove his scientific knowledge into his poetry. He was particularly obsessed with the sea and featured marine invertebrates in many of his works. The molluscs in his poem “Mollusca Gongorina” are unusual in being specified by their Latin genera. In this zoopoetic analysis, we first ask whether the 11 specimens can be identified to species and find that eight have ready identifications based on morphology in the poem's text, and three have likely identifications based on the poem's themes. We then examine illustrations and translations of the poem, identify where they are consonant or dissonant with the biology of the original, and propose alternative translations informed by the species' identities. Our zoopoetic approach to what could today be considered a STEAMy poem surfaces the beauty of its imagery and narrative, reflects the biological sophistication of the poet, enhances the coherence of its translations making it accessible to a wider audience, and allows it to enhance the biological literacy of the reader. © 2023 The American Microscopical Society LLC."
"The potential applications of blockchain technology across various business functions and industries have generated significant interest. However, its underlying knowledge structure remains unclear. This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the technological domain and knowledge structure of blockchain technology by analyzing 4753 USPTO patent data from 2008 to 2019. We used multiple approaches, such as analyzing patent filing volumes, constructing co-citation networks, and examining text (patent abstract) data with a variant of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). The results demonstrate the advantages of using an NLP-based BERT text analysis approach for examining technological knowledge and relationships within the blockchain technology field. Our findings reveal that the field of blockchain technology is expanding and diversifying, with increasing patent filings in both cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technologies and growing knowledge similarity between these two subdomains. We also found that patent assignees (companies) engage differently in innovative activities within the blockchain technology domain based on their prior experience in the field. These results hold potential for informing future research in emerging technology studies and guiding industry and policy decisions related to blockchain technology. © 2023 by the authors."

"With the rapid development of social network platforms, Sina Weibo has become the main carrier for modern netizens to express public views and emotions. How to obtain the tendency of public opinion and analyze the text’s emotion more accurately and reasonably has become one of the main challenges for the government to monitor public opinion in the future. Due to the sparseness of Weibo text data and the complex semantics of Chinese, this paper proposes an emotion analysis model based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers pre-training model (BERT), Fast Gradient Method (FGM) and the bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), namely BERT-FGM-BiGRU model. Aiming to solve the problem of text polysemy and improve the extraction effect and classification ability of text features, this paper adopts the BERT pre-training model for word vector representation and BiGRU for text feature extraction. In order to improve the generalization ability of the model, this paper uses the FGM adversarial training algorithm to perturb the data. Therefore, a BERT-FGM-BiGRU model is constructed with the goal of sentiment analysis. This paper takes the Chinese text data from the Sina Weibo platform during COVID-19 as the research object. By comparing the BERT-FGM-BiGRU model with the traditional model, and combining the temporal and spatial characteristics, it further studies the changing trend of user sentiment. Finally, the results show that the BERT-FGM-BiGRU model has the best classification effect and the highest accuracy compared with other models, which provides a scientific method for government departments to supervise public opinion. Based on the classification results of this model and combined with the temporal and spatial characteristics, it can be found that public sentiment is spatially closely related to the severity of the pandemic. Due to the imbalance of information sources, the public showed negative emotions of fear and worry in the early and middle stages, while in the later stage, the public sentiment gradually changed from negative to positive and hopeful with the improvement of the epidemic situation. © 2023 by the authors."
"PURPOSE: A range of materials for single-tooth computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) restorations have been introduced that may affect CAM accuracy. This study aimed to review articles evaluating marginal and internal fit of lithium disilicate (LD) and zirconia (Z) crowns fabricated by CAD-CAM systems using intraoral optical scanners (IOS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Under the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA), a systematic review was performed along with an electronic article search in the Medline/Pubmed database. The articles were limited to those in the English language that were published within the past ten years. RESULTS: The initial search resulted in 50 articles and of those, a total of 18 articles were selected for full-text review following abstract evaluation. Eight articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded and the remaining ten articles, which provided internal and marginal gap values, were used in this review. For LD crowns, marginal gap values ranged between 45µm and 190.2µm. For Z crowns, the values varied between 39µm and 126.4µm. For LD crowns, the internal gap values were between 57.8µm and 475.4µm, and for Z crowns, the values were between 79µm and 205.8µm. CONCLUSION: The outcome of this review suggests that clinically acceptable marginal and internal fit can be attained with LD and Z all-ceramic CAD-CAM crowns using digital impressions. Additionally, it has been found that LD and Z ceramics provide similar marginal gap values, but LD material provides better internal fit than Z."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis is a fine-grained sentiment analysis that focuses on the sentiment polarity of different aspects of text, and most current research methods use a combination of dependent syntactic analysis and graphical neural networks. In this paper, a graph attention network aspect-based sentiment analysis model based on the weighting of dependencies (WGAT) is designed to address the problem in that traditional models do not sufficiently analyse the types of syntactic dependencies; in the proposed model, graph attention networks can be weighted and averaged according to the importance of different nodes when aggregating information. The model first transforms the input text into a low-dimensional word vector through pretraining, while generating a dependency syntax graph by analysing the dependency syntax of the input text and constructing a dependency weighted adjacency matrix according to the importance of different dependencies in the graph. The word vector and the dependency weighted adjacency matrix are then fed into a graph attention network for feature extraction, and sentiment polarity is predicted through the classification layer. The model can focus on syntactic dependencies that are more important for sentiment classification during training, and the results of the comparison experiments on the Semeval-2014 laptop and restaurant datasets and the ACL-14 Twitter social comment dataset show that the WGAT model has significantly improved accuracy and F1 values compared to other baseline models, validating its effectiveness in aspect-level sentiment analysis tasks. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques and methodologies for problem solving are emerging as formal tools essential to assist in nursing care. Given their potential to improve workflows and to guide decision making, several studies have been developed; however, little is known about their impact, particularly on decision making. Objective: The aim of this study was to map the existing research on the use of AI in decision making in nursing. With this review protocol, we aimed to map the existing research on the use of AI in nursing decision making. Methods: A scoping review was conducted following the framework proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI). The search strategy was tailored to each database/repository to identify relevant studies. The contained articles were the targets of the data extraction, which was conducted by two independent researchers. In the event of discrepancies, a third researcher was consulted. Results: This review included quantitative, qualitative and mixed method studies. Primary studies, systematic reviews, dissertations, opinion texts and gray literature were considered according to the three steps that the JBI has defined for scoping reviews. Conclusions: This scoping review synthesized knowledge that could help advance new scientific developments and find significant and valuable outcomes for patients, caregivers and leaders in decision making. This review was also intended to encourage the development of research lines that may be useful for the development of AI tools for decision making. © 2023 by the authors."
"Purpose: The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to determine whether there are speech rhythm differences between preschool-age children who stutter that were eventually diagnosed as persisting (CWS-Per) or recovered (CWS-Rec) and children who do not stutter (CWNS), using empirical spectral analysis and empirical mode decomposition of the speech amplitude envelope, and (b) to determine whether speech rhythm characteristics close to onset are predictive of later persistence. Method: Fifty children (3–4 years of age) participated in the study. Approxi-mately 2–2.5 years after the experimental testing took place, children were assigned to the following groups: CWS-Per (nine boys, one girl), CWS-Rec (18 boys, two girls), and CWNS (18 boys, two girls). All children produced a narrative based on a text-free storybook. From the audio recordings of these narra-tives, fluent utterances were selected for each child from which seven envelope-based measures were extracted. Group-based differences on each measure as well as predictive analyses were conducted to identify measures that discriminate CWS-Per versus CWS-Rec. Results: CWS-Per were found to have a relatively higher degree of power in suprasyllabic oscillations and greater variability in the timing of syllabic rhythms especially for longer utterances. A logistic regression model using two speech rhythm measures was able to discriminate the eventual outcome of recovery versus persistence, with 80% sensitivity and 75% specificity. Conclusion: Findings suggest that envelope-based speech rhythm measures are a promising approach to assess speech rhythm differences in developmental stuttering, and its potential for identification of children at risk of developing persistent stuttering should be investigated further. © 2023 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association."
"Background: Recent years have seen major advancements in xenotransplantation: the first pig-to-human heart transplant, the development of a brain-dead recipient model for kidney xenotransplantation, and the registration of the first xenokidney clinical trial. The attitudes of patients with kidney disease or transplants on xenotransplantation and an assessment of their reservations and considerations regarding the technology are crucial to successful clinical translation and eventual widespread implementation. Methods: This systematic review was registered through PROSPERO (CRD42022344581) prior to initiation of the study and reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We included studies that evaluated attitudes towards and willingness to undergo xenotransplantation in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), including those who had already undergone transplantation. MEDLINE (via Ovid), Embase (via Elsevier), and Web of Science (via Clarivate) were searched from database inception to July 15, 2022 by an experienced medical librarian for studies on xenotransplantation and attitudes. Abstracts and full text were screened using Covidence software and data items regarding study methodology, patient demographics, and attitudes regarding xenotransplantation were extracted using Microsoft Excel. Risk of bias assessments were performed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programmed and National Institute of Health study quality assessment tools. Results: Of 1992 studies identified, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies were conducted across eight countries, four in the United States, for a total of 3114 patients on the kidney waitlist or with a kidney transplant. All patients were over 17 years old and 58% were male. Acceptance of a xenotransplant was assessed using surveys in 12 studies. Sixty-three percent (n = 1354) of kidney patients reported that they would accept a xenotransplant with function comparable to that of an allotransplant. Acceptance of xenografts with inferior function to allografts (15%) or as bridge organs (35%) to allotransplantation was lower. Specific concerns expressed by patients included graft function, infection, social stigma, and animal rights. Subgroup analyses showed higher acceptance in already transplanted compared to waitlist patients and white compared to Black Americans. Conclusion: An understanding of patient attitudes and reservations is key to the successful execution of the first xenotransplantation clinical trials. This study compiles important factors to consider, such as patient concerns, attitudes regarding practical clinical scenarios for the use of xenotransplantation, and the impact of demographic factors on acceptance of this emerging technology. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"This paper uses supervised machine learning (sentiment analysis) to analyze the sentiments of social media information in the P2P lending market. After segmentation, filtering, feature word extraction, and model training of the text information captured by Python, the sentiments of media and social media information were calculated to examine the effect of media and social media sentiments on default probability and cost of capital of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms in China (2015–2019). We find that only positive changes in media and social media sentiment have significantly negative effects on the platform’s default probability and cost of capital, while negative changes in sentiment do not have any effects. We conclude the existence of an asymmetric effect of media and social media sentiments in the Chinese peer-to-peer lending market. © 2023 by the authors."
"The political debate in social networks, and its derivatives such as hate speech, has surfaced at the top of the social agenda due to its impact on public opinion and, consequently, in the communication strategies of political parties, public institutions, media corporations, and lobbies. The scientific community has been working to respond to the demand for tools that allow studying the political attitude of citizens in these networks, focusing on sentiment analysis methodologies. However, their work has been hampered by several significant challenges, such as the absence of standardized investigation methodologies, the filtering of content created by bots and spammers, or the interpretation of slang and other conventionalisms that are specific to microblogging platforms. In addition to these challenges and the generic problems related to the interpretation of human language, researchers from the Spanish-speaking community have found themselves with the additional problem of developing strategies and methodologies suitable for Spanish text, in a scenario dominated by research aimed at the English language. In this paper, we present a systematic review that describes the state of the art in sentiment analysis methods for politics and hate speech contents in the Spanish language, by systematically reviewing the relevant papers available. © 2003-2012 IEEE."
"Gamers’ perceptions of using competitive digital games, especially concerning anxiety and socialization, have raised doubts about the benefits of playing such games. Since different studies highlight different results, this research aims to explore these differences by analyzing the perceptions of adults involved in playing a competitive digital game, in this case, FIFA, considering data that were collected during the COVID-19 pandemic period. The main question is ‘How do adults perceive anxiety, stress, and socialization when playing the FIFA digital game?’. The research comprises two studies involving volunteer participants: In the first part, which adopts a qualitative approach, the participants’ perceptions of what they think and feel when playing FIFA were analyzed and interpreted using text mining analysis. In the second, a quantitative study, FIFA users’ perceptions of the gaming experience were statistically analyzed. The results show that adult users tend to refer to positive perceived stress and socialization. The fact that participants identified manipulations and interference in the game and no longer allowed its use to influence their mood reveals that perceptions of attacks of rage were considered possible reactions to the use of the game, interpreted from the interface, and leading to the creation of knowledge. © 2022 by the authors."
"Do extreme events have a significant effect about textual sentiment? The purpose of this article is to highlight the need to correct the estimation of indicators of economic uncertainty. The indicators were constructed from textual data about the perspective of extreme events. For this purpose, based on data extracted from the minutes of mee-tings of the Monetary Policy of eighteen Central Banks, we estimated two variables of perception of economic uncertainty: the first using only a traditional sentiment dictio-nary and the second incorporating terms associated with the extreme event (COVID- 19 Pandemic) in its word list. Initial results show that there is a significant effect of COVID-19 on the estimation of the perception of economic uncertainty; this effect acts as an accelerator that potentiates its impact. It was evident that incorporating conjunctural issues - be it local or global - is indispensable when performing sentiment analysis in texts during extreme events. Moreover, failing to take conjunctural issues into account throughout the estimation process can result in variables with biased in-formation. © 2023 The Authors"
"PURPOSE:Consent processes are critical for clinical care and research and may benefit from incorporating digital strategies. We compared an electronic informed consent (eIC) option to paper consent across four outcomes: (1) technology burden, (2) protocol comprehension, (3) participant agency (ability to self-advocate), and (4) completion of required document fields. METHODS:We assessed participant experience with eIC processes compared with traditional paper-based consenting using surveys and compared completeness of required fields, over 3 years (2019-2021). Participants who consented to a clinical trial at a large academic cancer center via paper or eIC were invited to either pre-COVID-19 pandemic survey 1 (technology burden) or intrapandemic survey 2 (comprehension and agency). Consent document completeness was assessed via electronic health records.RESULTS:On survey 1, 83% of participants (n = 777) indicated eIC was easy or very easy to use; discomfort with technology overall was not correlated with discomfort using eIC. For survey 2, eIC (n = 262) and paper consenters (n = 193) had similar comprehension scores. All participants responded favorably to at least five of six agency statements; however, eIC generated a higher proportion of positive free-text comments (P <.05), with themes such as thoroughness of the discussion and consenter professionalism. eIC use yielded no completeness errors across 235 consents versus 6.4% for paper (P <.001).CONCLUSION:Our findings suggest that eIC when compared with paper (1) did not increase technology burden, (2) supported comparable comprehension, (3) upheld key elements of participant agency, and (4) increased completion of mandatory consent fields. The results support a broader call for organizations to offer eIC for clinical research discussions to enhance the overall participant experience and increase the completeness of the consent process.  © American Society of Clinical Oncology."
"It is important to classify academic papers in a fine-grained manner to uncover deeper implicit themes and semantics in papers for better semantic retrieval, paper recommendation, research trend prediction, topic analysis, and a series of other functions. Based on the ontology of the climate change domain, this study used an unsupervised approach to combine two methods, syntactic structure and semantic modeling, to build a framework of subject-indexing techniques for academic papers in the climate change domain. The framework automatically indexes a set of conceptual terms as research topics from the domain ontology by inputting the titles, abstracts and keywords of the papers using natural language processing techniques such as syntactic dependencies, text similarity calculation, pre-trained language models, semantic similarity calculation, and weighting factors such as word frequency statistics and graph path calculation. Finally, we evaluated the proposed method using the gold standard of manually annotated articles and demonstrated significant improvements over the other five alternative methods in terms of precision, recall and F1-score. Overall, the method proposed in this study is able to identify the research topics of academic papers more accurately, and also provides useful references for the application of domain ontologies and unsupervised data annotation. © 2023 by the authors."
"Objective: To assess the influence of systemic sclerosis (SSc) on the survival rate of dental implants in SSc patients receiving implant-supported treatments. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) Statement and the Cochrane Collaboration's guiding principles were followed during the study's execution. The data from three databases, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, available until January 2023, were used to compile the material for our research. Only English-language publications were submitted for this research and evaluated based on their titles, abstracts, and full texts. For performing a quality assessment, quality scores were calculated. Results: The total number of patients and implants studied were 37 and 153, respectively, all having had scleroderma. The patients’ ages ranged from 28 to 77 years old, with a mean (SD) age of 58.16 (12.88). All the patients in the case reports and most in the case series study were female. The range of follow-up duration was from 1 to 10 years. In case report studies, the survival rate was 100%; in case series, it was 89.2%. Conclusion: The SSc status had no discernible impact on the implant survival rate. Implant-based treatments in SSc patients should not worsen the overall morbidity and should not conflict with systemic treatments. Before starting implant therapy, a thorough risk assessment is essential, though. © 2023 The Authors. Immunity, Inflammation and Disease published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."

"The article is carried out within the framework of a scientific project, is devoted to the analysis of book maps of Russian authors of the XIX – early XX centurшуы, cataloging and introduction into scientific circulation of cartographic unique, little-known data in order to study the visual history of Kazakhstan. The source base was the book collections of rare editions with book maps of the National Library named after Alisher Navoi, Tashkent (NBUz) and of the Orenburg Universal Scientific Library named after N.K. Krupskaya (OUSL). During the preparation of the catalog, a single catalog description of the book maps was developed. The methodology of the research is a comprehensive interdisciplinary approach of broad interaction between the humanities and natural sciences, which made it possible to identify, analyze and prepare a bibliography of book maps. A cartographic method is used as a special method, which allows cataloging and description of book maps. The operational and functional advantages of the catalog of cartographic materials are substantiated, where each researcher can get an answer where and under what number the necessary book with a book maps is located. In the description of the book maps using the materials of the book, additional opportunities appear to characterize historical facts more fully and visually show the dynamics of the events taking place. Comparison of the book maps and the text showed that the cartographic material contains information that is not in the text of the book. The historical details of the formation of the border, possible ways of melioration of the Central Asian region unknown pages of military history, the participation of the Kazakhs in the military campaign to Khiva in 1839-1840, the peculiarities of the distribution and nomadic ways of the Kazakhs district were revealed. The authors conclude that Russian scientists, travelers, bureaucrats and the military left a significant book heritage with phenomenal cartographic material for studying the visual history of Kazakhstan.

"This Cord erratum Injury” corrects (J. Haefeli, the article Mabray “Multivariate MC, Whetstone Analysis WD, of et MRI al. AJNR Biomarkers Am J Neuroradiol for Predicting 2017;38:648 Neurologic –55 Impairment 10.3174/ajnr.A5021). in Cervical Spinal In the original publication, there was an error in the Materials and Methods section on page 649 under the Image Analysis heading related to a description of the Brain and Spinal Injury Center (BASIC) score grading, which erroneously included a description of 6 distinct grades. The corrected version of text for this section is below and describes the correct 5 grades (grade 0 through grade 4) composing the BASIC score. A neuroradiology fellow (M.C.M.) and attending physician (J.F.T.) performed consensus MR imaging ratings for all metrics while blinded to clinical outcome. The interrater reliability and BASIC axial MR imaging grading have been previously described as follows:4,30 grade 0, no cord signal abnormality; grade I, T2 hyperintensity confined to GM; grade II, intramedullary T2 hyperintensity extending beyond the expected gray matter margins to involve spinal white matter but not involving the entire transverse extent of the spinal cord; grade III, T2 hyperintensity involving the entire axial plane of the spinal cord; grade IV, grade III injury with the addition of foci of T2 hypointensity consistent with hemorrhage. Sagittal grading was assigned as previously described as follows: grade I, no spinal cord signal abnormality; grade II, single-level T2 hyperintensity; grade III, .1 vertebral-level T2 signal hyperintensity; grade IV, T2 signal hyperintensity with areas of hypointensity representing hemorrhage.1,19 The greatest length (millimeters) of injury on sagittal T2 was measured as described in the National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke SCI Common Data Elements, Version 1.0.3 Maximum canal compromise (MCC) and maximum spinal cord compression (MSCC) assessed midsagittal images by dividing the anterior-posterior diameter of the canal (on sagittal T1 for MCC) and the anterior-posterior diameter of spinal cord (on sagittal T2 for MSCC) by the average of the canal or spinal cord above and below as previously described.8,15,16,22,. © 2023 American Society of Neuroradiology.

"Phrase-final syllable duration and pauses are generally considered to be positively correlated: The stronger the boundary, the longer the duration of phrase-final syllables, and the more likely or longer a pause. Exploring a large sample of complex literary prose texts read aloud, we examined pause likelihood and duration, pre-boundary syllable duration, and the pitch excursion at prosodic boundaries. Comparing these features across six predicted levels of boundary strength (level 0: no break; 1: simple phrase break; 2: short comma phrase break; 3: long comma phrase break; 4: sentence boundary; 5: direct speech boundary), we find that they are not correlated in a simple monotonic fashion. Whereas pause duration monotonically increases with boundary strength, both pre-boundary syllable duration and the pitch excursion on the pre-boundary syllable are largest for level-2 breaks and decrease significantly through levels 3 to 5. Our analysis suggests that pre-boundary syllable duration is partly contingent on the tonal realization, which is subject to f0 declination as the utterance progresses. We also surmise that pre-boundary syllable duration reflects differences in planning complexity for the different prosodic and syntactic boundaries. Overall, this study shows that a simple monotonic correlation between pause duration and pre-boundary syllable duration is not valid. © 2023 The Authors"
"Aims and objectives Studies have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on individuals who interact with patients with SARS-CoV-2 but focused largely on clinicians in acute care settings. This qualitative descriptive study aimed to understand the experiences and well-being of essential workers across settings during the pandemic. Background Multiple studies of the well-being of individuals who have cared for patients during the pandemic have included interviews of clinicians from acute care settings and revealed high levels of stress. However, other essential workers have not been included in most of those studies, yet they may also experience stress. Methods Individuals who participated in an online study of anxiety, depression, traumatic distress, and insomnia, were invited to provide a free-text comment if they had anything to add. A total of 2,762 essential workers (e.g., nurses, physicians, chaplains, respiratory therapists, emergency medical technicians, housekeeping, and food service staff, etc.) participated in the study with 1,079 (39%) providing text responses. Thematic analysis was used to analyze those responses. Results Four themes with eight sub-themes were: Facing hopelessness, yet looking for hope; Witnessing frequent death; Experiencing disillusionment and disruption within the healthcare system, and Escalating emotional and physical health problems. Conclusions The study revealed major psychological and physical stress among essential workers. Understanding highly stressful experiences during the pandemic is essential to identify strategies that ameliorate stress and prevent its negative consequences. This study adds to the research on the psychological and physical impact of the pandemic on workers, including non-clinical support personnel often overlooked as experiencing major negative effects. Relevance to clinical practice The magnitude of stress among all levels of essential workers suggests the need to develop strategies to prevent or alleviate stress across disciplines and all categories of workers. © 2023 Copel et al.

"Acoustic emission (AE) was monitored during stress intensity factor (SIF)-controlled high-cycle fatigue (HCF) tests on an aluminum 2024-T3 specimen with a fatigue crack growing at its center. The SIF control was implemented in such a manner that crack growth could be slowed down and even inhibited while the fatigue experiment continued. In the beginning, a specific type of AE signal was observed while the crack was allowed to grow to up to approximately 9.4 mm in length. Subsequently, the load was reduced in order to control the SIF value at the crack tip and to inhibit the crack growth. AE signals were recorded even when the crack stopped growing, although the specific signature of these AE signals was different from those observed when the crack was growing, as discussed in the text. The gist of the phenomenon reported in this article is that strong AE signals could still be observed even when the crack stopped growing. These latter AE signals could be due to rubbing and clapping of the crack faying surfaces. Travel analysis was consistently performed to ensure that these AE signals were originating from the crack, though not necessarily from the crack tip. In addition, absorbing clay wave dams were built around the crack region to inhibit boundary reflections and grip noise. Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Choi–Williams Transform (CWT) analysis were performed to classify the AE signals. It was observed that the AE signals related to crack growth were clearly different from the AE signals originating from the crack while the crack was not growing. Strong S0-mode Lamb wave components were observed in the crack-growth AE signals, whereas strong A0-mode Lamb wave components dominated the non-crack-growth AE signals. Pearson correlation clustering analysis was performed to compare the crack-growth and non-crack growth AE signals. We propose that the fatigue-crack faying surfaces may undergo rubbing and/or clapping during fatigue cyclic loading and thus produce strong AE signals that are registered by the AE system as hits, although the crack is not actually growing. The understanding of this phenomenon is very important for the design of the structural health monitoring (SHM) system based on AE-hit signal capture and interpretation. © 2023 by the authors."
"Digitization and transcription of historic documents offer new research opportunities for humanists and are the topics of many edition projects. However, manual work is still required for the main phases of layout recognition and the subsequent optical character recognition (OCR) of early printed documents. This paper describes and evaluates how deep learning approaches recognize text lines and can be extended to layout recognition using background knowledge. The evaluation was performed on five corpora of early prints from the 15th and 16th Centuries, representing a variety of layout features. While the main text with standard layouts could be recognized in the correct reading order with a precision and recall of up to 99.9%, also complex layouts were recognized at a rate as high as 90% by using background knowledge, the full potential of which was revealed if many pages of the same source were transcribed. © 2023 by the authors."
"Analysing writing development as a function of foreign language competence is important in secondary school children because the developmental patterns are strongest at a young age when successful interventions are needed. Although a number of researchers have explored the degree to which specific textual characteristics in EFL students’ essays are associated with high and low ratings by teachers, the extent to which such characteristics are associated with rater-mediated assessment under standard exam conditions remains relatively unexplored. Motivated by the above void in pertinent literature, the overall aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between specific discourse features present in the writing scripts of EFL learners sitting for the British Council’s APTIS for TEENS exam and the assigned scores during operational scoring by specially trained raters. A total of 800 international EFL students aged 13 to 15 years old took part in the study, and 800 scored written essays on the same task prompt of the pertinent test produced under standard exam conditions were analysed. The results showed statistically significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) between the linguistic features identified in the essays produced by young EFL learners at different levels of language competence. The main text features that were repeatedly found to make a significant contribution to distinguishing scores assigned to texts both within and across levels were word frequency, word abstractness, lexical diversity, lexical and semantic overlap, all of which could be used to obtain a numerical cut-off point between proficiency levels. These findings support the notion that progress in L2 writing is primarily associated with producing more elaborate texts with more sophisticated words, more complex sentence structure and fewer cohesive features as a function of increased language competence. The findings of the study could provide practical guidance to EFL teachers, material developers and test designers as to the kind of linguistic strategies young EFL learners develop as a function of their level of language competence and suggestions to consider when designing EFL classroom curricula, writing skills textbooks and exam papers on written production. © 2022 by the author."
"Background This systematic review evaluates pneumolysin (PLY) as a target for new treatments against pneumococcal infections. Pneumolysin is one of the main virulence factors produced by all types of pneumococci. This toxin (53 kDa) is a highly conserved protein that binds to cholesterol in eukaryotic cells, forming pores that lead to cell destruction. Methods The databases consulted were MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus. Articles were independently screened by title, abstract, and full text by two researchers, and using consensus to resolve any disagreements that occurred. Articles in other languages different from English, patents, cases report, notes, chapter books and reviews were excluded. Searches were restricted to the years 2000 to 2021. Methodological quality was evaluated using OHAT framework. Results Forty-one articles describing the effects of different molecules that inhibit PLY were reviewed. Briefly, the inhibitory molecules found were classified into three main groups: those exerting a direct effect by binding and/or blocking PLY, those acting indirectly by preventing its effects on host cells, and those whose mechanisms are unknown. Although many molecules are proposed as toxin blockers, only some of them, such as antibiotics, peptides, sterols, and statins, have the probability of being implemented as clinical treatment. In contrast, for other molecules, there are limited studies that demonstrate efficacy in animal models with sufficient reliability. Discussion Most of the studies reviewed has a good level of confidence. However, one of the limitations of this systematic review is the lack of homogeneity of the studies, what prevented to carry out a statistical comparison of the results or meta-analysis. Conclusion A panel of molecules blocking PLY activity are associated with the improvement of the inflammatory process triggered by the pneumococcal infection. Some molecules have already been used in humans for other purposes, so they could be safe for use in patients with pneumococcal infections. These patients might benefit from a second line treatment during the initial stages of the infection preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome and invasive pneumococcal diseases. Additional research using the presented set of compounds might further improve the clinical management of these patients. Copyright: © 2023 Cima Cabal et al.

SURFE²R allows the use of the standard 96-well format, making it an ideal platform for tertiary assays in a drug-discovery campaign. The assays are performed with cell-line-derived membrane fractions or proteoliposomes containing the transporter of interest. Three main protocols are described for the isolation of membrane fractions from cell culture and the generation of proteoliposomes containing the transporter of interest. Additionally, detailed protocols for SURFE²R single concentration and dose-response experiments are included to measure the potencies of test compounds in stimulating or inhibiting transporter function (EC50 or IC50 values, respectively) and kinetic functional assays to calculate apparent affinity (kM) and maximal velocity (Vmax) of substrate uptake. © 2023 Sanofi.

"Using data on Chinese A-share listed firms from 2008 to 2017, we explore how corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance is affected by managerial short-termism and what factors influence the association between the two. First, by employing text analysis in conjunction with machine learning, we construct a new managerial short-termism indicator. Using panel fixed models, we find that managerial short-termism has an adverse impact on CSR performance, and the results are consistent in a series of robustness checks. The heterogeneous test results show that the negative effect is significant only for firms with lower internal corporate governance, for firms in less competitive industries, for firms with less analyst attention, and for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Additionally, a better institutional environment weakens the negative impact of managerial short-termism on CSR performance. The findings shed light on policy implications for emerging countries. © 2023 The Authors"
"Background and objectives: Medical notes are narratives that describe the health of the patient in free text format. These notes can be more informative than structured data such as the history of medications or disease conditions. They are routinely collected and can be used to evaluate the patient's risk for developing chronic diseases such as dementia. This study investigates different methodologies for transforming routine care notes into dementia risk classifiers and evaluates the generalizability of these classifiers to new patients and new health care institutions. Methods: The notes collected over the relevant history of the patient are lengthy. In this study, TF-ICF is used to select keywords with the highest discriminative ability between at risk dementia patients and healthy controls. The medical notes are then summarized in the form of occurrences of the selected keywords. Two different encodings of the summary are compared. The first encoding consists of the average of the vector embedding of each keyword occurrence as produced by the BERT or Clinical BERT pre-trained language models. The second encoding aggregates the keywords according to UMLS concepts and uses each concept as an exposure variable. For both encodings, misspellings of the selected keywords are also considered in an effort to improve the predictive performance of the classifiers. A neural network is developed over the first encoding and a gradient boosted trees model is applied to the second encoding. Patients from a single health care institution are used to develop all the classifiers which are then evaluated on held-out patients from the same health care institution as well as test patients from two other health care institutions. Results: The results indicate that it is possible to identify patients at risk for dementia one year ahead of the onset of the disease using medical notes with an AUC of 75% when a gradient boosted trees model is used in conjunction with exposure variables derived from UMLS concepts. However, this performance is not maintained with an embedded feature space and when the classifier is applied to patients from other health care institutions. Moreover, an analysis of the top predictors of the gradient boosted trees model indicates that different features inform the classification depending on whether or not spelling variants of the keywords are included. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that medical notes can enable risk prediction models for complex chronic diseases such as dementia. However, additional research efforts are needed to improve the generalizability of these models. These efforts should take into consideration the length and localization of the medical notes; the availability of sufficient training data for each disease condition; and the variabilities resulting from different feature engineering techniques. © 2023 The Authors"
"Background: Good communication is central to effective social work practice, helping to develop constructive working relationships and improve the outcomes of people in receipt of social work services. There is strong consensus that the teaching and learning of communication skills for social work students is an essential component of social work qualifying courses. However, the variation in communication skills training and its components is significant. There is a sizeable body of evidence relating to communication skills training therefore a review of the findings helps to clarify what we know about this important topic in social work education. We conducted this systematic review to determine whether communication skills training for social work students works and which types of communication skills training, if any, were more effective and lead to the most positive outcomes. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to critically evaluate all studies which have investigated the effectiveness of communication skills training programmes for social work students. The research question which the review posed is: ‘What is the effectiveness of communication skills training for improving the communicative abilities of social work students?’ It was intended that the review would provide a robust evaluation of communication skills training for social work students and help explain variations in practice to support educators and policy-makers to make evidence-based decisions in social work education, practice and policy. Search Methods: We conducted a search for published and unpublished studies using a comprehensive search strategy that included multiple electronic databases, research registers, grey literature sources, and reference lists of prior reviews and relevant studies. Selection Criteria: Study selection was based on the following characteristics: Participants were social work students on generic (as opposed to client specific) qualifying courses; Interventions included any form of communication skills training; eligible studies were required to have an appropriate comparator such as no intervention or an alternative intervention; and outcomes included changes in knowledge, attitudes, skills and behaviours. Study selection was not restricted by geography, language, publication date or publication type. Data Collection and Analysis: The search strategy was developed using the terms featuring in existing knowledge and practice reviews and in consultation with social work researchers, academics and the review advisory panel, to ensure that a broad range of terminology was included. One reviewer conducted the database searches, removing duplicates and irrelevant records, after which each record was screened by title and abstract by both reviewers to ensure robustness. Any studies deemed to be potentially eligible were retrieved in full text and screened by both reviewers. Main Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Overall, findings indicate that communication skills training including empathy can be learnt, and that the systematic training of social work students results in some identifiable improvements in their communication skills. However, the evidence is dated, methodological rigour is weak, risk of bias is moderate to high/serious or incomplete, and extreme heterogeneity exists between the primary studies and the interventions they evaluated. As a result, data from the included studies were incomplete, inconsistent, and lacked validity, limiting the findings of this review, whilst identifying that further research is required. Authors’ Conclusions: This review aimed to examine effects of communication skills training on a range of outcomes in social work education. With the exception of skill acquisition, there was insufficient evidence available to offer firm conclusions on other outcomes. For social work educators, our understanding of how communication skills and empathy are taught and learnt remain limited, due to a lack of empirical research and comprehensive discussion. Despite the limitations and variations in educational culture, the findings are still useful, and suggest that communication skills training is likely to be beneficial. One important implication for practice appears to be that the teaching and learning of communication skills in social work education should provide opportunities for students to practice skills in a simulated (or real) environment. For researchers, it is clear that further rigorous research is required. This should include using validated research measures, using research designs which include appropriate counterfactuals, alongside more careful and consistent reporting. The development of the theoretical underpinnings of the interventions used for the teaching and learning of communication skills in social work education is another area that researchers should address. © 2023 The Authors.

"Objective To systematically review the effects of the early childhood physical activity program (ECPAP) on gross motor skill (GMS) in preschool children. Methods We searched Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Library, EBSCO SPORTDiscus with Full Text, CNKI, WanFangData and VIP databases to collect randomized controlled trails (RCT) about ECPAP for improving GMS in preschool children from the establishment of the database to August 8, 2022. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. Meta-analysis was then performed using RevMan 5.4.1 and Stata 15.0 software. Results A total of 18 studies including 1 141 children in experimental group and 1 135 children in control group were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that after ECPAP, the GMS (SMD=1.96, 95%CI 1.44 to 2.49), locomotor skills (SMD=1.15, 95%CI 0.83 to 1.46) and manipulative skills (SMD=1.25, 95%CI 0.84 to 1.65) of the experimental group were significantly better than those of the control group (P<0.05). Conclusion ECPAC is considered to significantly promote the GMS of preschool children. Due to the limited quantity and quality of the included studies, more high-quality studies are needed to verify the above conclusion. © 2023 West China University of Medical Science.

"This paper compares the results of a real linear synchronous motor and its digital twin. It differs from other common publications in that it uses only basic mathematical models representing a particular physical principle. In this way, a minimum of input parameters was achieved. At the same time, all model input parameters are normally listed in the motor datasheet or are easily measurable. Nowadays, digital twins are very important for the development of new machines. Achieving accuracy using the finite element method is possible, but the time requirement does not allow real-time simulations. The digital twin in this paper is based on a mathematical model involving temperature dependence. The real motor is loaded at different operating points to better evaluate the quality of the model. The structure of the control loops has a significant effect on the response of the digital twin, so the design is based on the motor driver used. The text focuses on linear synchronous motors, but the methods used can be generalized to the plane of rotary synchronous motors. © 2023, MM publishing Ltd.. All rights reserved."
"Considering that the public health sector has been considered as a key stakeholder in climate action, it seems important to understand what interventions are carried out globally by trusted professionals such as nurses engaged in health promotion and environmental health in optimizing the health of individuals, families, and communities toward the dissemination of lifestyle decarbonization and guidance on healthier climate-related choices. The objective of this review was to understand the extent and type of evidence related to the community-based interventions of nurses that are being led or have been implemented thus far with the aim of reducing the health risks from climate change impact in urban areas. The present protocol follows the JBI methodological framework. Databases to be searched include PubMed, MEDLINE complete, CINAHL, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library Online), and BASE (Bielefeld Academic Search Engine). Hand searched references were also considered for inclusion. This review will include quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies from 2008 onwards. Systematic reviews, text, opinion papers, and the gray literature in English and Portuguese were also considered. Mapping the nurse led interventions or those that have been implemented thus far in urban areas may lead to further reviews that may help identify the best practices and gaps within the field. The results are presented in tabular format alongside a narrative summary. © 2023 by the authors."
"Objective The purpose of this study is to evaluate reading time and characteristics of fixations at different distances when looking through different areas of progressive power lenses (PPL) with different power distributions by means of eye-tracking technology. Method A wearable eye tracker system (Tobii-Pro Glasses 3) was used to record the pupil position of 28 PPL subjects when reading at near and distance vision while using 3 different PPL designs: a PPL optimized for distance vision (PPL-Distance), a PPL optimized for near vision (PPL-Near) and one of them balanced for a general use (PPL-Balance). Subjects were asked to read out loud a text displayed on a digital screen located at 5.25m and 0.37m when they were looking through the central and peripheral regions of each PPL. Reading time, total duration of fixations, and the number of fixations were analyzed for each reading condition and PPL. Statistical analysis was carried out using Statgraphics Centurion XVII.II Software. Results The analysis of eye movements at distance-reading vision showed a statistically significant lower reading time (p = 0.004) and lower total duration of fixations (p = 0.01) for PPL-Distance. At near-reading vision, PPL-Near provided statistically significant lower reading time (p<0.001), lower total duration of fixations (p = 0.02), and less fixation count(p<0.001) in comparison with PPL-Balance and PPL-Distance. Conclusions Reading time and fixations characteristics are affected by the power distribution of a PPL. A PPL design with a wider distance region provides better distance-reading performance while a PPL with a wider near area performs better at a near-reading task. The power distribution of PPLs influences the user performance at vision-based tasks. Thus, to provide the user with the best visual experience, PPL selection must consider user needs. © 2023 Concepcion-Grande et al.

"Nowadays, e-learning and web-based learning are the most integrated new learning methods in schools, colleges, and higher educational institutions. The recent web-search-based learning methodological approach has helped online users (learners) to search for the required topics from the available online resources. The learners extracted knowledge from textual, video, and image formats through web searching. This research analyzes the learner’s significant attention to searching for the required information online and develops a new recommendation system using machine learning (ML) to perform the web searching. The learner’s navigation and eye movements are recorded using sensors. The proposed model automatically analyzes the learners’ interests while performing online searches and the origin of the acquired and learned information. The ML model maps the text and video contents and obtains a better recommendation. The proposed model analyzes and tracks online resource usage and comprises the following steps: information logging, information processing, and word mapping operations. The learner’s knowledge of the captured online resources using the sensors is analyzed to enhance the response time, selectivity, and sensitivity. On average, the learners spent more hours accessing the video and the textual information and fewer hours accessing the images. The percentage of participants addressing the two different subject quizzes, Q1 and Q2, increased when the learners attempted the quiz after the web search; 43.67% of the learners addressed the quiz Q1 before completing the web search, and 75.92% addressed the quiz Q2 after the web search. The average word counts analysis corresponding to text, videos, overlapping text or video, and comprehensive resources indicates that the proposed model can also apply for a continuous multi sessions online search learning environment. The experimental analysis indicates that better measures are obtained for the proposed recommender using sensors and ML compared with other methods in terms of recall, ranking score, and precision. The proposed model achieves a precision of 27% when the recommendation size becomes 100. The root mean square error (RMSE) lies between 8% and 16% when the number of learners < 500, and the maximum value of RMSE is 21% when the number of learners reaches 1500. The proposed recommendation model achieves better results than the state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
"Background Appropriate medication use is essential in ensuring optimal pharmacotherapeutic outcomes. It is mistakenly assumed that adults can swallow solid oral dosage forms (SODFs, e.g.Tablets/ capsules colloquially referred to as 'pills'), without difficulty and that children cannot. KidzMed is a 'pill swallowing' training programme designed to teach effective SODF use in patients of all ages. It may be utilised by healthcare professionals to assist patients taking SODFs. E-learning was essential for training during COVID pandemic to reduce viral transmission. The aim of this study was to explore UK student pharmacists views of e-learning to support swallowing solid oral dosage forms. Methods This study used pre-and post-intervention online surveys on Microsoft Forms to evaluate self-directed eLearning about pill swallowing on MPharm programmes at three UK Universities using a 13-item survey. A combination of five-point Likert Scales and free-Text items were used. The eLearning was available via the virtual learning environment at the University and embedded within existing curriculum. Descriptive statistical analysis was used to explore responses. Results In total, 113 of 340 (33%) students completed the survey. Seventy-eight percent (n = 65) reported the eLearning would enable them to teach adults and children to swallow SODFs successfully. Learners either agreed or strongly agreed that they felt comfortable to teach patients (95%, n = 62/113) and parents or carers (94%, n = 60) to swallow medications having completed the e-learning. Student pharmacists generally found eLearning as an acceptable way to reflect on their own experiences of 'pill' swallowing and how to support patients to swallow SODFs. Conclusion The KidzMed eLearning was well received by student pharmacists. Further work is needed to explore whether skills translates into real life application in the clinical settings.  © 2023 McCloskey et al."
"Evidence on the effectiveness of melatonin in breast cancer patients suffering from sleep disturbances is contradictory, and there have been no meta-analyses on its use in humans with breast cancer. This study investigated the melatonin supplementation effectiveness in alleviating sleep disturbances in breast cancer patients. We searched Embase, PubMed, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and Clinical trial.org databases for relevant reports by following PRISMA guidelines and collected clinical experimental studies of melatonin supplementation in breast cancer patients. Breast cancer for the population, melatonin supplementation for intervention, including sleep indicator, cancer treatment-related symptoms for outcomes, and clinical trial for humans were the searched keywords. Among the 1917 identified records, duplicates and irrelevant articles were excluded. Among the 48 full-text articles assessed, 10 studies met the criteria for inclusion in a systematic review, and five studies had sleep-related indicators and were included in the meta-analysis after quality assessment. The estimated average effect size (Hedges’ g) was −0.79 (p < 0.001) in a random-effects model, thus indicating that melatonin supplementation had a moderate effect in ameliorating sleep quality in breast cancer patients. Pooled data from studies on melatonin supplementation indicate that melatonin administration may alleviate sleep problems related to treatments in breast cancer patients. © 2023 by the authors."
"Volume 199, no. 17, e00359-17, 2017, https://doi.org/10.1128/JB.00359-17. Genomic analysis of the DTTHA0328 deletion strain developed in this study revealed that this strain is a derivative of Thermus thermophilus HB27 and not HB8. However, the amino acid sequence of the product of TTHA0328 in the HB8 strain is a perfect match with the homologue of the HB27 strain (locus tag: TTC1655), and all other genes involved in the NAD1 salvage pathway were also conserved between the two strains. In addition, gene organization and the sequence around the nicotinamidase (NAMase) are similar between the two strains and thus the knockout mutant for TTC1655 was successfully constructed using the primers that were designed based on the HB8 genome sequence. Therefore, the results and conclusions presented in the original paper, including sequence alignment (Fig. 2) and recombinant protein characteristics (Fig. 3), are valid if the strain and gene names are replaced throughout the text and Fig. 2 and 3 as shown in the table in this correction (Table Presented).

"Featured Application: Text Mining, Apriori Algorithm, Association Rules, Rule-based Machine Learning Method, Web Graph Analysis, Content Analysis, Qualitative Projective Technique, Textual Complaints. By looking at complaints made by guests of different star-rated hotels, this study attempts to detect associations between complaint attributions and specific consequences. A multifaceted approach is applied. First, a content analysis is conducted to transform textual complaints into categorically structured data. Furthermore, a web graph analysis and rule-based machine learning method are applied to discover potential relationships among complaint antecedents and consequences. These are validated using a qualitative projective technique. Using an Apriori rule-based machine learning algorithm, optimal priority rules for this study were determined for the respective complaining attributions for both the antecedents and consequences. Based on attribution theory, we found that Customer Service, Room Space, and Miscellaneous Issues received more attention from guests staying at higher star-rated hotels. Conversely, cleanliness was a consideration more prevalent amongst guests staying at lower star-rated hotels. Qualitative research was conducted to corroborate the findings. Other machine learning techniques (i.e., Decision Tree) build rules based on only a single conclusion, while association rules attempt to determine many rules, each of which may lead to a different conclusion. The main contributions of this study lie in the fact that this is one of the first attempts to detect correlations within the online complaining behaviors of guests of different star-rated hotels by utilizing rule-based machine learning. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background and Aims: The success of every new technology depends on numerous factors, including specialists' knowledge and perceptions of the concept, acquired attitude skills, and work environments. This systematic review aimed to examine medical students' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of telemedicine. Methods: Studies were obtained from the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases on June 9, 2022. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Cross-sectional studies that examined medical students' knowledge, attitude, and perceptions of telemedicine approaches were considered inclusion criteria. Titles and abstracts were independently screened based on eligibility criteria. Articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded from this review. After that, the complete texts were retrieved and screened by two separate researchers based on the eligibility criteria. Disputes were resolved by discussion. The same checklist was used for data extraction. To assess the quality of the studies entering this study, the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for analytical cross-sectional studies was used. Results: In total, 10 eligible articles were found through this review. The sample size of the studies ranged from 60 to 3312 participants, or 6172 participants on the whole. The medical students' attitudes toward telemedicine were evaluated in eight included studies. Many of these studies (seven cases) reported positive and promising perspectives on telemedicine. However, in one study, participants revealed moderate attitudes toward online health information and online health experience sharing (p < 0.05). Students' knowledge of the telemedicine approach was evaluated in eight included studies. Many of these studies (five cases) reported that students possessed an extensively poor knowledge of telemedicine's uses. In three other studies, two reported moderate and one disclosed desirable levels of students' knowledge. All the included studies attributed medical students' poor knowledge to the lack of, and thus failure of, educational courses in this field. Conclusion: The evidence obtained from this review reveals that medical students possess positive and promising attitudes toward telemedicine technology for education, treatment, and care. However, their knowledge levels were extremely insufficient, and many had not passed any educational courses in this respect. Such results can foreground the health and education policymakers' obligations for planning, training, and empowering digital health and telemedicine literacy among medical students as the primary players in social health. © 2023 The Authors.

"The implementation of digitalization has gradually become an important strategy for many enterprises to improve sustainability. The text mining and principal component analysis methods were used to measure enterprise digitalization and the level of enterprise resilience from 2011 to 2019, respectively. This study then explored the impact of digitalization on enterprise resilience. This research comes to three conclusions. (1) Digitalization can improve enterprise resilience significantly, but beyond the threshold, it inhibits enterprise resilience. In other words, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between digitalization and enterprise resilience, and the steepness of this inverted U-shape shows a marginal increasing trend. (2) Notably, Resource allocation efficiency and information accessibility play a mediating effect in the impact of digitization on enterprise resilience. Further analysis found that the improvement of enterprise resilience is not only conducive to the growth of total factor productivity but also conducive to the high-quality development of the manufacturing industry. (3) The influence of digitization on enterprise resilience in areas with a high level of marketization, labor-and technology-intensive industries, and eastern and coastal areas is more obvious. The impact of digitization on the sustainable development of small and medium-sized enterprises, and private and foreign-funded enterprises is more significant. Finally, corresponding policy suggestions are proposed. © 2023"
"Background The international collaboration study PRICOV-19 -Primary Health Care in times of COVID-19 aims to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the organisation of primary health care. The German part focuses on the subjective perceptions of general practitioners on primary health care and the impact of political measures during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Within this survey, the “open text field” of the questionnaire was utilised remarkably frequently and extensively by the respondents. It became clear that the content that was named needed to be analysed in an exploratory manner. Accordingly, this paper addresses the following question: What preoccupies general practitioners in Germany during COVID-19 that we have not yet asked them enough? Methods The data collection took place throughout Germany from 01.02.2021 to 28.02.2021with a quantitative online questionnaire consisting of 53 items arranged across six topics as well as an “open text field” for further comments. The questionnaire's open text field was analysed following the premises of the qualitative content analysis. Results The topics discussed by the respondents were: insufficient support from health policies, not being prioritised and involved in the vaccination strategy, feeling insufficient prepared, that infrastructural changes and financial concerns threatened the practice, and perceiving the own role as important, as well as that health policies affected the wellbeing of the respondents. One of the main points was the way general practitioners were not sufficiently acknowledged for their contribution to ensuring high-quality care during the pandemic. Discussion German general practitioners perceived their work and role as highly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic. In controversy with their perception, they described political conditions in which they were the ones who contributed significantly to the fight against the pandemic but were not given enough recognition.

"Background: Healthcare providers (HCPs) may be at elevated risk for moral injury due to increased exposure to potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs) throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Identifying PMIEs experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic is a critical first step for understanding moral injury in HCPs. Accordingly, the purpose of the present study was to gain a deeper understanding of the work-related PMIEs experienced by HCPs in Canada during the pandemic. Methods: Canadian HCPs completed an online survey between February and December 2021 about mental health and functioning, including demographics and the Moral Injury Outcome Scale (MIOS). We conducted a qualitative thematic analysis of PMIEs described extemporaneously by HCPs in the open-text field of the MIOS. Results: One-hundred and twenty-four (N = 124) HCPs were included in analysis. Eight PMIE-related themes were identified, comprising patients dying alone; provision of futile care; professional opinion being ignored; witnessing patient harm; bullying, violence and divided opinions; resources and personal protective equipment; increased workload and decreased staffing; and conflicting values. Conclusions: Understanding broad categories of PMIES experienced by Canadian HCPs during the COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to enhance cultural competency surrounding their experiences which will aid the development of targeted prevention and intervention approaches. © 2023 by the authors."
"Objective: Evaluation of the success and/or survival rates of resin-bonded fixed partial dentures (RBFPDs) reported in the scientific literature with a minimum average observation time of five years. Materials and Methods: Search conducted in Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases in free-text format and MESH terms, until May 2021. The random-effects model was used for the estimated survival rate, percentage per year of estimated failure, and existing complications for the meta-analysis. Study heterogeneity was assessed by the inconsistency test (I2) and study quality by the Downs and Black scale. Results: Eleven articles were included, with 687 participants and 783 RBFPDs, with a mean observation time of 8.2 years, with success rates mentioned in three articles and survival rates reported in nine articles. A total of 142 failures were reported for 783 prostheses, the most frequent being debonding. The estimated failure rate was between 0.53% and 5.10% per year. The studies were of sufficient quality. In the meta-analysis, the survival rates showed a significant result (p < 0.001), with moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 58.76%). Conclusions: Within the limitations of this research, mainly related to the heterogeneity of the studies and their quality, it seems possible to conclude that RBFPDs are a viable clinical option for the rehabilitation of patients with single edentulous spaces, mainly when using a single retainer and a zirconia-ceramic prosthesis. © 2023 by the authors."
"In the energy sector, since the adoption of remote device management for massive advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) devices and Internet of Things (IoT) technology using a representational state transfer (RESTful) architecture, a blurred boundary has been developed between traditional AMI and IoT. With respect to smart meters, the standard-based smart metering protocol, called the device language message specification (DLMS) protocol, still has a predominant role in the AMI industry. Thus, we aim to propose a novel data interworking model in this article that embraces the DLMS protocol in AMI using the most promising IoT protocol, the so-called lightweight machine-to-machine (LwM2M) protocol. We provide a 1:1 conversion model using the correlation of the two protocols with an analysis of the object modeling and resource management methods of both the LwM2M and DLMS protocols. The proposed model utilizes a complete RESTful architecture, which is the most beneficial in the LwM2M protocol. It improves the average packet transmission efficiency and packet delay on the plaintext and encrypted text (session establishment and authenticated encryption) by 52.9%p and 9.9%p, respectively, and by 11.86 ms for both cases, compared to the encapsulation method of the LwM2M protocol, KEPCO’s current approach. This work provides the key idea to unify the protocol for the remote metering and device management of field devices into the LwM2M protocol, and it is expected that this work will improve the efficiency in the operation and management of KEPCO’s AMI system. © 2023 by the authors."
"The impact of a chief executive officer s (CEO s) functional experience on firm performance has gained the attention of many scholars. However, the measurement of functional experience is rarely disclosed in the public database. Few studies have been conducted on the comprehensive functional experience of CEOs. This paper used the upper echelons theory and obtained deep-level curricula vitae (CVs) data through the named entity recognition technique. First, we mined 15 consecutive years of CEOs CVs from 2006 to 2020 from Chinese listed companies. Second, we extracted information throughout their careers and automatically classified their functional hierarchy. Finally, we constructed breadth (functional breadth: functional experience richness) and depth (functional depth: Average tenure and the hierarchy of function) for empirical analysis. We found that a CEO s breadth is significantly negatively related to firm performance, and the quadratic term is significantly positive. A CEO s depth is significantly positively related to firm performance, and the quadratic term is significantly negative. The research results indicate a u-shaped relationship between a CEO s breadth and firm performance and an inverted u-shaped relationship between their depth and firm performance. The study s findings extend the literature on factors influencing firm performance and CEOs functional experience. The study expands from the horizontal macro to the vertical micro level, providing new evidence to support the recruitment and selection of high-level corporate talent. © 2023 Public Library of Science.

"It is critical to safeguard confidential data, especially secret and private messages. This study introduces a novel data cryptography approach. The new approach will be capable of encrypting and decrypting any communication size. The suggested approach will use a sophisticated private key with a convoluted structure. The private key will have 5 components with a double data type to prevent guessing or hacking. The confidential data will produce two secret keys, the first of which will be taken from the image key. These keys will be vulnerable to slight changes in private key information. To maximize the approach's efficiency, the suggested method will deal with lengthy messages by splitting them into chunks. On the other hand, the chaotic logistic map model will be used to create the second key. The suggested technique will be implemented, and several sorts of analysis (sensitivity, quality, security, and speed analysis) will be undertaken to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method. The quality metrics MSE, PSNR, and CC will be com-puted to validate the suggested method's quality. To illustrate the efficiency of the proposed tech-nique, encryption and decryption times will be measured, and cryptography throughputs will be determined. Various PKs will be tried throughout the decryption process to demonstrate how sen-sitive the produced outputs are to changes in the private key. The suggested approach will be tested, and the results will be compared to the results of existing methods to demonstrate the improvement offered by the proposed method. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada."
"Introduction: As the significance of social workers (SW) in improving healthcare delivery in the emergency department (ED) continues to expand, emergency physicians will increasingly be expected to effectively partner with SWs in both academic and community settings. In this scoping review we sought to provide evidence-based recommendations for effective emergency clinician educational interventions on how to incorporate SWs in the ED to address health-related social needs while also identifying directions for future research. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review of publications in PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and APA PsycINFO. A search strategy was designed in accordance with Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategies (PRESS) guidelines. Using the scoping review framework by Arksey and O’Malley, we applied consensus-based inclusion and exclusion criteria to guide study selection. A Preferred Reporting Items for Systemic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow chart delineating the selection process was generated using Covidence. Results: Our search strategy identified nine qualifying articles for further analysis out of an initial sample of 2,119 articles. Of the nine articles that underwent full text review, 89% (8/9) evaluated a short educational didactic with or without a hands-on component to reinforce learning. Barriers to successful implementation of curricula discussed in all articles included time constraints, lack of buy-in from clinical faculty, lack of knowledge of appropriate referral sources once a problem is identified, and perceived distraction of the training from more standard clinical topics. Facilitators of curricula implementation and training success included the presence of a pre-existing and structured weekly conference schedule, ability to complete the training in a relatively short time frame or during intern orientation, presence of simulation resources, and residents’ overall perceived interest in the topics. Conclusion: Ultimately, we found that interdisciplinary learning with SWs is generally well received by participants, and we offer various suggestions on incorporation into student and resident education. Moving forward, we recommend that a standardized curriculum of working with SWs be developed using didactic sessions, simulation, and/or direct observation with feedback. © 2023 Rehman et al."
"Introduction: In people living with human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV), traditional cardiovascular risk factors, exposure to HIV per se and antiretroviral therapy (ART) are assumed to contribute to cardiometabolic diseases. Nevertheless, controversy exists on the relationship of HIV and ART with diabetes. To clarify the relationship between HIV and type 2 diabetes, this review determined, in PLHIV in Africa, diabetes and prediabetes prevalence, and the extent to which their relationship was modified by socio-demographic characteristics, body mass index (BMI), diagnostic definitions used for diabetes and prediabetes, and HIV-related characteristics, including CD4 count, and use and duration of ART. Methods: For this systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration CRD42021231547), a comprehensive search of major databases (PubMed-MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and WHO Global Health Library) was conducted. Original research articles published between 2000 and 2021 in English and French were included, irrespective of study design, data collection techniques and diagnostic definitions used. Observational studies comprising at least 30 PLHIV and reporting on diabetes and/or prediabetes prevalence in Africa were included. Study-specific estimates were pooled using random effects models to generate the overall prevalence for each diagnostic definition. Data analyses used R statistical software and “meta” package. Results: Of the 2614 records initially screened, 366 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 61 were selected. In the systematic review, all studies were cross-sectional by design and clinic-based, except for five population-based studies. Across studies included in the meta-analysis, the proportion of men was 16–84%. Mean/median age was 30–62 years. Among 86,412 and 7976 participants, diabetes and prediabetes prevalence rates were 5.1% (95% CI: 4.3–5.9) and 15.1% (9.7–21.5). Self-reported diabetes (3.5%) was lower than when combined with biochemical assessments (6.2%; 7.2%). Discussion: While not statistically significant, diabetes and prediabetes were higher with greater BMI, in older participants, urban residents and more recent publications. Diabetes and prediabetes were not significantly different by HIV-related factors, including CD4 count and ART. Conclusions: Although HIV-related factors did not modify prevalence, the diabetes burden in African PLHIV was considerable with suboptimal detection, and likely influenced by traditional risk factors. Furthermore, high prediabetes prevalence foreshadows substantial increases in future diabetes in African PLHIV. © 2023 The Authors.

"Background: Frequent use of antibiotics in patients with COVID-19 threatens to exacerbate antimicrobial resistance. We aimed to establish the prevalence and predictors of bacterial infections and antimicrobial resistance in patients with COVID-19. Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies of bacterial co-infections (identified within ≤48 h of presentation) and secondary infections (>48 h after presentation) in outpatients or hospitalised patients with COVID-19. We searched the WHO COVID-19 Research Database to identify cohort studies, case series, case-control trials, and randomised controlled trials with populations of at least 50 patients published in any language between Jan 1, 2019, and Dec 1, 2021. Reviews, editorials, letters, pre-prints, and conference proceedings were excluded, as were studies in which bacterial infection was not microbiologically confirmed (or confirmed via nasopharyngeal swab only). We screened titles and abstracts of papers identified by our search, and then assessed the full text of potentially relevant articles. We reported the pooled prevalence of bacterial infections and antimicrobial resistance by doing a random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression. Our primary outcomes were the prevalence of bacterial co-infection and secondary infection, and the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens among patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and bacterial infections. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021297344). Findings: We included 148 studies of 362 976 patients, which were done between December, 2019, and May, 2021. The prevalence of bacterial co-infection was 5·3% (95% CI 3·8–7·4), whereas the prevalence of secondary bacterial infection was 18·4% (14·0–23·7). 42 (28%) studies included comprehensive data for the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial infections. Among people with bacterial infections, the proportion of infections that were resistant to antimicrobials was 60·8% (95% CI 38·6–79·3), and the proportion of isolates that were resistant was 37·5% (26·9–49·5). Heterogeneity in the reported prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in organisms was substantial (I2=95%). Interpretation: Although infrequently assessed, antimicrobial resistance is highly prevalent in patients with COVID-19 and bacterial infections. Future research and surveillance assessing the effect of COVID-19 on antimicrobial resistance at the patient and population level are urgently needed. Funding: WHO. © 2023 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

"The paper investigates the multiple representation approach as used in elementary school science learning. A systematic literature review (SLR) method and preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) protocol were employed in this research. This included systematic review stages, eligibility and exclusion criteria, review process procedures, and data abstraction and analysis assisted by Publish or Perish 7, VOSviewer, and NVivo 12 Plus applications. The search for publications on Scopus through the Publish or Perish 7 application yielded 605 publications, and for the ERIC database, there were 2018 publications, making 2623 publications. The publications were then filtered according to compatible themes and 50 were selected to be used as material for the SLR. The 50 publications were analyzed according to the assigned topics through the NVivo 12 Plus application, and the results are described in this paper. According to literature, multiple representations is a learning approach that involves using more than one or two representations. This is done by utilizing text, video, tables, audio, animation, diagrams, analogies, cartoons, movements, formulas, and graphs to reflect, interpret, and solve scientific problems in elementary science learning. The multiple representation approach is implemented through task assignment, visualization technology; representation of images, symbols, tables, pictures, and graphs; scientific investigations; engineering design; technological skills; applications; recordings; and written symbols. The impact that the multiple representation approach has in elementary science learning is an increase in reasoning skills, critical thinking skills, communication skills, solving of science problems, concern for nature conservation, and social and visual intelligence. This paper contributes to research examining multiple representations in elementary school science learning. © Authors."
"Background and Aims: This systematic review examined healthcare students' attitudes, knowledge, and skill in Artificial Intelligence (AI). Methods: On August 3, 2022, studies were retrieved from the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses recommendations were followed. We included cross-sectional studies that examined healthcare students' knowledge, attitudes, skills, and perceptions of AI in this review. Using the eligibility requirements as a guide, titles and abstracts were screened. Complete texts were then retrieved and independently reviewed per the eligibility requirements. To collect data, a standardized form was used. Results: Of the 38 included studies, 29 (76%) of healthcare students had a positive and promising attitude towards AI in the clinical profession and its use in he future; however, in nine of the studies (24%), students considered AI a threat to healthcare fields and had a negative attitude towards it. Furthermore, 26 studies evaluated the knowledge of healthcare students about AI. Among these, 18 studies evaluated the level of student knowledge as low (50%). On the other hand, in six of the studies, students' high knowledge of AI was reported, and two of the studies reported average student general knowledge (almost 50%). Of the six studies, four (67%) of the students had very low skills, so they stated that they had never worked with AI. Conclusion: Evidence from this review shows that healthcare students had a positive and promising attitude towards AI in medicine; however, most students had low knowledge and limited skills in working with AI. Face-to-face instruction, training manuals, and detailed instructions are therefore crucial for implementing and comprehending how AI technology works and raising students' knowledge of the advantages of AI. © 2023 The Authors.

"Words are fundamental linguistic units that connect thoughts and things through meaning. However, words do not appear independently in a text sequence. The existence of syntactic rules induces correlations among neighboring words. Using an ordinal pattern approach, we present an analysis of lexical statistical connections for 11 major languages. We find that the diverse manners that languages utilize to express word relations give rise to unique pattern structural distributions. Furthermore, fluctuations of these pattern distributions for a given language can allow us to determine both the historical period when the text was written and its author. Taken together, our results emphasize the relevance of ordinal time series analysis in linguistic typology, historical linguistics, and stylometry.  © 2023 Author(s)."
"Cypriot Arabic (CyAr) is a severely endangered Semitic variety spoken by Cypriot Maronites. It belongs to the group of “peripheral varieties” of Arabic that were separated from the core Arabic-speaking area and came into contact with non-Semitic languages. Although there has been a renewed interest since the turn of the century for the study of CyAr, some aspects of its structure are still not well known. In this paper, we present and analyze a number of developments in CyAr induced by contact with Cypriot Greek. Our methodology for investigating such phenomena makes a novel contribution to the description of this underrepresented variety, as it was based not only on existing linguistic descriptions and text corpora in the literature, but mainly on a vast corpus of naturalistic oral speech data from the Archive of Oral Tradition of CyAr. Our analysis revealed the complexity of investigated contact phenomena and the differing degrees of integration of borrowings into the lexico-grammatical system of CyAr. © 2022 by the authors."
"Current research on knowledge graph construction is focused chiefly on general-purpose fields, whereas constructing knowledge graphs in vertically segmented professional fields faces numerous difficulties. To solve the problems of complex relation types of domain entities, the lack of a large amount of annotated corpus, and the difficulty of extraction, this study proposed a method for constructing domain-annotated datasets based on publicly available texts on the web, which integrates remote supervision and semi-supervision. For the relational triad extraction of a given core entity (an entity lexicon defined semi-automatically by experts), an inflated gate attention network structure for increasing the perceptual field of the model is proposed. In addition, a relational extraction model, Ro-DGANet, was designed based on this structure, incorporating the idea of a probability graph. The Ro-DGANet model was experimentally evaluated on the publicly available Chinese datasets LIC2019 and CHIP2020 and compared with the mainstream relation extraction models, achieving the best results with F1 values of 82.99% and 66.39%, respectively. Finally, the Ro-DGANet model was applied to the relation extraction task of equipment components in industrial scenarios and to the relation extraction task of core knowledge points of programming languages. The analysis results show that the proposed method is applicable to open relation extraction among core entities in different domains with reliable performance and portability. © 2023 by the authors."
"Introduction: Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is most common in the upper limb and associated with high disability. The purpose of this review was to critically appraise and synthesise literature exploring non-pharmacological treatment for upper limb CRPS, to guide upper-limb-specific management. Methods: Using an integrative review methodology, 13 databases were searched to identify all published studies on non-pharmacological management of upper limb CRPS. The Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool was used to provide quality ratings for included studies, and analysis employed a qualitative descriptive approach. Results: From 236 abstracts reviewed, 113 full texts were read, and 38 articles selected for data extraction. Designs included single case (n = 14), randomised controlled trial (n = 8), prospective cohort (n = 8), case series (n = 4), retrospective (n = 3), and mixed methods (n = 1). Interventions were categorised as sensory retraining (n = 13), kinesiotherapy (n = 7), manual therapies (n = 7), physical modalities (n = 6), and interdisciplinary treatment programmes (n = 5). All studies measured pain intensity, and most (n = 24) measured physical parameters such as strength, movement, or perceptual abilities. Few measured patient-rated function (n = 13) or psychological factors (n = 4). Quality ratings ranged from 30% to 93%, with a median of 60%. Conclusion: Methodological quality of non-pharmacological treatment approaches for upper limb CRPS is overall poor. Movement, desensitisation, and graded functional activity remain the mainstays of intervention. However, despite the impact of CRPS on wellbeing and function, psychological factors and functional outcomes are infrequently addressed. Further robust research is required to determine which aspects of treatment have the greatest influence on which symptoms, and when and how these should be introduced and progressed. © The Author(s) 2023."
"This study aims to provide research results through empirical analysis on how customers’ reactions on social media affect the present and future value of a company. This research selected Korean KOSPI-listed companies that actually own and operate YouTube channels, and collected data through text mining the comments on YouTube videos with high views. In addition, the TF-IDF value was calculated, keywords were extracted, and keywords were classified into three groups through topic modeling. The characteristics of the three groups could be transformed into a “current-oriented topic” as advertising promotion content focused on fun or interest; a “future-oriented topic” as critical content pointing out problems, and a “neutral topic” as content of a neutral attitude toward companies. This study uses a regression analysis model to perform an empirical analysis by setting a company’s YouTube-related variable as an independent variable and setting a company’s current value and future value-related variable as a dependent variable. The results of this research are as follows. First, this paper found that companies that directly operate and manage YouTube accounts currently have lower corporate value than those that do not. Second, this study also found that companies which directly operate and manage YouTube accounts have higher future corporate value than those that do not. Third, the results showed that if a customer simply mentions interesting content or advertising/promotion-related content through corporate YouTube comments, the current corporate value may be improved in the short term, but in the long term, it has a negative effect on future corporate value. Fourth, the results of this research also presented that if a customer criticizes a company or points out a company’s problems through YouTube comments, the current corporate value decreases due to damage to the company’s image, but it was found that the future corporate value increases. Fifth, this paper found that neutral content, not just for fun and interest, nor for constructive criticism or dissatisfaction with the company, was not related to the company’s current and future corporate value. The contributions and expected effects of this paper are as follows. First of all, this paper provides useful information through research results which shows that companies are more advantageous in improving future corporate value from a long-term perspective by strategically operating social media directly. In addition, the research results of this study objectively demonstrated through YouTube channels that it is more helpful for companies in the long run to respond well to customer complaints and negative opinions, and to implement policies that continuously manage customer opinions. Finally, the research method used in this paper, that is, the research methodology that conducted empirical analysis through quantification of unstructured tax data, is expected to provide guidelines for many scholars to expand the scope of data available for empirical research in the future. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background Decision impact studies have become increasingly prevalent in cancer prognostic research in recent years. These studies aim to evaluate the impact of a genomic test on decision-making and appear to be a new form of evidence of clinical utility. The objectives of this review were to identify and characterize decision impact studies in genomic medicine in cancer care and categorize the types of clinical utility outcomes reported. Methods We conducted a search of four databases, Medline, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science, from inception to June 2022. Empirical studies that reported a “decision impact” assessment of a genomic assay on treatment decisions or recommendations for cancer patients were included. We followed scoping review methodology and adapted the Fryback and Thornbury Model to collect and analyze data on clinical utility. The database searches identified 1803 unique articles for title/abstract screening; 269 articles moved to full-text review. Results 87 studies met inclusion criteria. All studies were published in the last 12 years with the majority for breast cancer (72%); followed by other cancers (28%) (lung, prostate, colon). Studies reported on the impact of 19 different proprietary (18) and generic (1) assays. Across all four levels of clinical utility, outcomes were reported for 22 discrete measures, including the impact on provider/team decision-making (100%), provider confidence (31%); change in treatment received (46%); patient psychological impacts (17%); and costing or savings impacts (21%). Based on the data synthesis, we created a comprehensive table of outcomes reported for clinical utility. Conclusions This scoping review is a first step in understanding the evolution and uses of decision impact studies and their influence on the integration of emerging genomic technologies in cancer care. The results imply that DIS are positioned to provide evidence of clinical utility and impact clinical practice and reimbursement decision-making in cancer care.

"Background: Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring reduces heart failure (HF) hospitalizations (HFHs) and improves quality of life in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III HF. We evaluated the impact of PAP monitoring on outcomes and health spending in a Canadian ambulatory HF cohort. Methods: Twenty NYHA III HF patients underwent wireless PAP implantation at Foothills Medical Centre, Calgary, Alberta. Baseline, and 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month assessments of laboratory parameters, hemodynamics, 6-minute walk text and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire scores were collected. Healthcare costs 1 year pre- and post-implantation were collected from administrative databases. Results: Mean age was 70.6 years; 45% were female. Results were as follows: an 88% reduction in emergency room visits (P = 0.0009); an 87% reduction in HFHs (P < 0.0003); a 29% reduction in heart function clinic visits (P = 0.033), and a 178% increase in nurse calls (P < 0.0002). Questionnaire and 6-minute walk test scores at baseline vs last follow-up were 45.4 vs 48.4 (P = 0.48) and 364.4 vs 402.8 m (P = 0.58), respectively. Mean PAP at baseline vs follow-up was 31.5 vs 24.8 mm Hg (P = 0.005). NYHA class improved by at least one class in 85% of patients. Mean measurable HF-related spending preimplantation was CAD$29,814 per patient per year and postimplantation was CAD$25,642 per patient per year (including device cost). Conclusions: PAP monitoring demonstrated reductions in HFHs, and emergency room and heart function clinic visits, with improvements in NYHA class. Although further economic evaluation is needed, these results support the use of PAP monitoring as an effective and cost-neutral tool in HF management in appropriately selected patients in a publicly funded healthcare system. © 2022 The Authors"
"Background: ""Spin"" refers to a manipulation of language that implies benefit for an intervention when none may exist. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in other fields have been demonstrated to employ spin, which can mislead clinicians to use ineffective or unsafe interventions. This study's objective was to determine the strategies, severity, and extent of spin in plastic surgery RCTs with nonsignificant primary outcomes. Methods: A literature search of the top 15 plastic surgery journals using MEDLINE was performed (2000 through 2020). Parallel 1:1 RCTs with a clearly identified primary outcome showing statistically nonsignificant results (P > 0.05) were included. Screening, data extraction, and spin analysis were performed by two independent reviewers. The spin analysis was then independently assessed in duplicate by two plastic surgery residents with graduate-level training in clinical epidemiology. Results: From 3497 studies identified, 92 RCTs were included in this study. Spin strategies were identified in 78 RCTs (85%), including 64 abstracts (70%) and 77 main texts (84%). Severity of spin was rated moderate or high in 43 abstract conclusions (47%) and 42 main text conclusions (46%). The most identified spin strategy in the abstract was claiming equivalence for statistically nonsignificant results (26%); in the main text, focusing on another objective (24%). Conclusions: This study suggests that 85% of statistically nonsignificant RCTs in plastic surgery employ spin. Readers of plastic surgery research should be aware of strategies, whether intentional or unintentional, used to manipulate language in reports of statistically nonsignificant RCTs when applying research findings to clinical practice. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"The most prominent tasks in emotion analysis are to assign emotions to texts and to understand how emotions manifest in language. An important observation for natural language processing is that emotions can be communicated implicitly by referring to events alone, appealing to an empathetic, intersubjective understanding of events, even without explicitly mentioning an emotion name. In psychology, the class of emotion theories known as appraisal theories aims at explaining the link between events and emotions. Appraisals can be formalized as variables that measure a cognitive evaluation by people living through an event that they consider relevant. They include the assessment if an event is novel, if the person considers themselves to be responsible, if it is in line with their own goals, and so forth. Such appraisals explain which emotions are developed based on an event, for example, that a novel situation can induce surprise or one with uncertain consequences could evoke fear. We analyze the suitability of appraisal theories for emotion analysis in text with the goal of understanding if appraisal concepts can reliably be reconstructed by annotators, if they can be predicted by text classifiers, and if appraisal concepts help to identify emotion categories. To achieve that, we compile a corpus by asking people to textually describe events that triggered particular emotions and to disclose their appraisals. Then, we ask readers to reconstruct emotions and appraisals from the text. This set-up allows us to measure if emotions and appraisals can be recovered purely from text and provides a human baseline to judge a model’s performance measures. Our comparison of text classification methods to human annotators shows that both can reliably detect emotions and appraisals with similar performance. Therefore, appraisals constitute an alternative computational emotion analysis paradigm and further improve the categorization of emotions in text with joint models. © 2022 Association for Computational Linguistics."
"This paper designed a voice interactive robot system that can conveniently execute assigned service tasks in real-life scenarios. It is equipped without a microphone where users can control the robot with spoken commands; the voice commands are then recognized by a well-trained deep neural network model of automatic speech recognition (ASR), which enables the robot to execute and complete the command based on the navigation of a real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm. The voice interaction recognition model is divided into two parts: (1) speaker separation and (2) ASR. The speaker separation is applied by a deep-learning system consisting of eight convolution layers, one LSTM layer, and two fully connected (FC) layers to separate the speaker’s voice. This model recognizes the speaker’s voice as a referrer that separates and holds the required voiceprint and removes noises from other people’s voiceprints. Its automatic speech recognition uses the novel sandwich-type conformer model with a stack of three layers, and combines convolution and self-attention to capture short-term and long-term interactions. Specifically, it contains a multi-head self-attention module to directly convert the voice data into text for command realization. The RGB-D vision-based camera uses a real-time appearance-based mapping algorithm to create the environment map and replace the localization with a visional odometer to allow the robot to navigate itself. Finally, the proposed ASR model was tested to check if the desired results will be obtained. Performance analysis was applied to determine the robot’s environment isolation and voice recognition abilities. The results showed that the practical robot system successfully completed the interactive service tasks in a real environment. This experiment demonstrates the outstanding performance with other ASR methods and voice control mobile robot systems. It also verified that the designed voice interaction recognition system enables the mobile robot to execute tasks in real-time, showing that it is a convenient way to complete the assigned service applications. © 2023 by the authors."
"In the business world, large companies that can achieve continuity in innovation gain a significant competitive advantage. The sensitivity of these companies to follow and monitor news sources in e-commerce, social media, and forums provides important information to businesses in the decision-making process. With the large amount of data shared in these resources, sentiment analysis can be made from people's comments about services and products, users' emotions can be extracted and important feedback can be obtained. All of this is of course possible with accurate sentiment analysis. In this study, new data sets were created for Turkish, English, and Arabic, and for the first time, comparative sentiment analysis was performed from texts in three different languages. In addition, a very comprehensive study was presented to the researchers by comparing the performances of both the pre-trained language models for Turkish, Arabic, and English, as well as the deep learning and machine learning models. Our paper will guide researchers working on sentiment analysis about which methods will be more successful in texts written in different languages, which contain different types and spelling mistakes, which factors will affect the success, and how much these factors will affect the performance. © 2023 The Author(s)"
"Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. Their popularity has increased in recent years due to their ability to learn and improve through experience, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. ANNs are often used as part of deep learning, which enables them to learn, transfer knowledge, make predictions, and take action. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of ANNs and explore potential directions for future research. To achieve this, the paper analyzes 10,661 articles and 35,973 keywords from various journals using a text-mining approach. The results of the analysis show that there is a high level of interest in topics related to machine learning, deep learning, and ANNs and that research in this field is increasingly focusing on areas such as optimization techniques, feature extraction and selection, and clustering. The study presented in this paper is motivated by the need for a framework to guide the continued study and development of ANNs. By providing insights into the current state of research on ANNs, this paper aims to promote a deeper understanding of ANNs and to facilitate the development of new techniques and applications for ANNs in the future. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: The lack of clinical guidelines for the treatment of primary psychodermatologic disorders (PPDs) hinders the delivery of optimal care to patients. The review aimed to identify, appraise, and summarize the currently available evidence about the safety and effectiveness of pharmacological management of PPDs through randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRIMSA) statement and the Global Evidence Mapping Initiative guidance were followed. Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Cochrane and Scopus were searched, and two reviewers independently completed article review, data extraction, and quality assessment. Results: Among 2618 unique studies, full texts of 83 were reviewed and 21 RCTs were included. Five PDDs were identified: trichotillomania (n = 12), pathologic skin picking (n = 5), nail biting (n = 2), delusional parasitosis (n = 1), and dermatitis from compulsive hand washing (n = 1). Seven different classes of medications were investigated: SSRIs (i.e., fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram), tricyclic antidepressants (i.e., clomipramine and desipramine), antipsychotics (i.e., olanzapine and pimozide), anticonvulsant (i.e., lamotrigine), N-acetylcysteine, inositol, and milk thistle. RCT-derived evidence supports the use of antidepressants in trichotillomania (sertraline and clomipramine), pathologic skin picking (fluoxetine), pathologic nail biting and dermatitis from compulsive hand washing (clomipramine or desipramine); antipsychotics in trichotillomania (olanzapine) and delusional parasitosis (pimozide); N-acetyl cysteine in trichotillomania and skin picking. Conclusion: Few pharmacotherapies for primary psychodermatologic disorders are assessed through controlled trials in the literature. This review serves as a roadmap for researchers and clinicians to reach informed decisions with current evidence, and to build on it to establish guidelines in the future. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Mutational signature analysis promises to reveal the processes that shape cancer genomes for applications in diagnosis and therapy. However, most current methods are geared toward rich mutation data that has been extracted from whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing. Methods that process sparse mutation data typically found in practice are only in the earliest stages of development. In particular, we previously developed the Mix model that clusters samples to handle data sparsity. However, the Mix model had two hyper-parameters, including the number of signatures and the number of clusters, that were very costly to learn. Therefore, we devised a new method that was several orders-of-magnitude more efficient for handling sparse data, was based on mutation co-occurrences, and imitated word co-occurrence analyses of Twitter texts. We showed that the model produced significantly improved hyper-parameter estimates that led to higher likelihoods of discovering overlooked data and had better correspondence with known signatures. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background and Objectives: The digital world offers opportunities for sex and love and also reflects societal stereotypes regarding sex and love among older adults. The aim of the current review is to look at the ways older adults use digital media for sex and love and also at digital media's representations of older adults. Research Design and Methods: We searched for studies published in English that used qualitative and/or quantitative methods, with findings based on empirical data from individuals 55 years of age or older. The following data sets were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL. Bibliographies of all relevant studies were searched. Titles and abstracts were reviewed, and selected articles were extracted independently by 2 reviewers. Results: A total of 1,819 records were retrieved. After removing duplicates, 1,488 records remained. Of these, 70 records remained for full-text screening, and a final count of 15 records was included for synthesis. Discussion and Implications: The present review highlights major research gaps in the field. Although studies have indeed focused on the online dating scene among this cohort, they have ignored older adults' sexuality in favor of other aspects (e.g., love and companionship). Representations of this cohort in terms of love and sex are also lacking, and diversity is hardly addressed. Additional research is needed to examine how older adults use digital media for reasons related to love and sex, and how the media mirrors societal stereotypes regarding sex and love among older adults.  © 2022 The Author(s).

"Reading-into-writing tasks are frequently used as an assessment tool in the higher education context. Due to the nature of the task, students strategically process the source texts to successfully select the relevant information and integrate it into their writing. This study addresses the questions of a) how students strategically process the source text in reading-into-writing tasks and b) if there are differences between summary and argumentative tasks with different topics (natural and social sciences) regarding students' strategic processing of the source text. For this purpose, four types of reading-into-writing tasks were developed and completed by 14 students from German universities. While completing the tasks, each participant was asked to verbalize their thoughts (think-aloud), and their screen was video recorded. The audio-visual data were transcribed and analysed using a deductive approach. Our results support previous research about discourse synthesis and metacognitive strategies in reading-into-writing tasks and indicate some differences between the types of tasks and topics in the employment of particular strategies. Moreover, our analyses show that higher-level and lower-level reading processes play a role in the source text strategic processing depending on the reader's goals. This study gives further insights into the reading-into-writing construct, considering task type and topic effects. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"Individuals with comorbidities (i.e., Diabetes Mellitus, hypertension, heart diseases) are more likely to develop a more severe form of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), thus, they should take necessary precautions to avoid infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its emerging variants and subvariants by getting COVID-19 vaccination and booster doses. In this regard, we used text analytics techniques, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP), to understand the perception of Twitter users having comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases) towards the COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. Understanding and identifying Twitter users' perceptions and perspectives will help the members of medical fraternities, governments, and policymakers to frame and implement a suitable public health policy for promoting the uptake of booster shots by such vulnerable people. A total of 176,540 tweets were identified through the scrapping process to understand the perception of individuals with the mentioned comorbidities regarding the COVID-19 booster dose. From sentiment analysis, it was revealed that 57.6% out of 176,540 tweets expressed negative sentiments about the COVID-19 vaccine booster doses. The reasons for negative expressions have been found using the topic modeling approach (i.e., risk factors, fear of myocardial fibrosis, stroke, or death, and using vaccines as bio-weapons). Of note, enhancing the COVID-19 vaccination drive by administering its booster doses to more and more people is of paramount importance for rendering higher protective immunity under the current threats of recently emerging newer Omicron subvariants which are presently causing a rise in cases in a few countries, such as China and others, and might lead to a feasible new wave of the pandemic with the surge in cases at the global level.  © The Author(s) 2023."
"Academic Medical Centres (AMCs) are important organisations for shaping healthcare. The purpose of this scoping review is to understand the scope and type of evidence related to the organisation of European AMCs. We selected the study population intending to obtain a demographic cross-section of European countries: Czech Republic, Germany, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden and the UK. We focused our search strategy on the relationship between medical schools and AMCs, the organisation of governing bodies, and legal ownership. We searched the bibliographic databases of PubMed and Web of Science (most recent search date 17-06-2022). To enrich the search result, we used Google search engines to conduct targeted searches for relevant websites. Our search strategy yielded 4,672 records for consideration. After screening and reviewing full-text papers, 108 sources were included. Our scoping review provided insight into the scope and type of evidence related to the organisation of European AMCs. Limited literature is available on the organisation of these AMCs. Information from national-level websites complemented the literature and provided a more complete picture of the organisation of European AMCs. We found some meta-level similarities regarding the relationship between universities and AMCs, the role of the dean and the public ownership of the medical school and the AMC. In addition, we found several reasons why a particular organisational and ownership structure was chosen. There is no uniform model for AMC organisations (apart from some meta-level similarities). Based on this study, we cannot explain the diversity in these models. Therefore, further research is needed to explain these variations. For example, by generating a set of hypotheses through in-depth case studies that also focus on the context of AMCs. These hypotheses can then be tested in a larger number of countries. © 2023 Cardinaal et al.

"Purpose. To revise the current literature on FIL SSF (Carlevale) intraocular lens, previously known as Carlevale lens, and to compare their outcomes with those from other secondary IOL implants. Methods. We performed a peer review of the literature regarding FIL SSF IOLs until April 2021 and analyzed the results only of articles with a minimum of 25 cases and a follow-up of at least 6 months. The searches yielded 36 citations, 11 of which were abstracts of meeting presentations that were not included in the analysis because of their limited data. The authors reviewed 25 abstracts and selected six articles of possible clinical relevance to review in full text. Of these, four were considered to be sufficiently clinically relevant. Particularly, we extrapolated data regarding the pre- and postoperative best corrected visual acuities (BCVA) and the complications related to the procedure. The complication rates were then compared with those from a recently published Ophthalmic Technology Assessment by the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) on secondary IOL implants. Results. Four studies with a total of 333 cases were included for results analysis. The BCVA improved in all cases after surgery, as expected. Cystoid macular edema (CME) and increased intraocular pressure were the most common complications, with an incidence of up to 7.4% and 16.5%, respectively. Other IOL types from the AAO report included anterior chamber IOLs, iris fixation IOLs, sutured iris fixation IOLs, sutured scleral fixation IOLs, and sutureless scleral fixation IOLs. There was no statistically significant difference in the rates of postoperative CME (p = 0.20), and vitreous hemorrhage (p = 0.89) between other secondary implants and the FIL SSF IOL, whereas the rate of retinal detachment was significantly less with FIL SSF IOLs (p = 0.04). Conclusion. The results of our study suggest the implantation of FIL SSF IOLs is an effective and safe surgical strategy in cases where there is a lack of capsular support. In fact, their outcomes seem to be comparable to those obtained with the other available secondary IOL implants. According to published literature, the FIL SSF (Carlevale) IOL provides favorable functional results with a low rate of postoperative complications. © 2023 by the authors."
"When compared with traditional local shops where the customer has a personalised service, in large retail departments, the client has to make his purchase decisions independently, mostly supported by the information available in the package. Additionally, people are becoming more aware of the importance of the food ingredients and demanding about the type of products they buy and the information provided in the package, despite it often being hard to interpret. Big shops such as supermarkets have also introduced important challenges for the retailer due to the large number of different products in the store, heterogeneous affluence and the daily needs of item repositioning. In this scenario, the automatic detection and recognition of products on the shelves or off the shelves has gained increased interest as the application of these technologies may improve the shopping experience through self-assisted shopping apps and autonomous shopping, or even benefit stock management with real-time inventory, automatic shelf monitoring and product tracking. These solutions can also have an important impact on customers with visual impairments. Despite recent developments in computer vision, automatic grocery product recognition is still very challenging, with most works focusing on the detection or recognition of a small number of products, often under controlled conditions. This paper discusses the challenges related to this problem and presents a review of proposed methods for retail product label processing, with a special focus on assisted analysis for customer support, including for the visually impaired. Moreover, it details the public datasets used in this topic and identifies their limitations, and discusses future research directions of related fields. © 2023 by the authors."
"Featured Application: Our work aims to provide a media analytics framework for the Greek language that utilizes subjectivity similarities among the related classification tasks, with potential for application to other low-resource languages. Media analysis (MA) is an evolving area of research in the field of text mining and an important research area for intelligent media analytics. The fundamental purpose of MA is to obtain valuable insights that help to improve many different areas of business, and ultimately customer experience, through the computational treatment of opinions, sentiments, and subjectivity on mostly highly subjective text types. These texts can come from social media, the internet, and news articles with clearly defined and unique targets. Additionally, MA-related fields include emotion, irony, and hate speech detection, which are usually tackled independently from one another without leveraging the contextual similarity between them, mainly attributed to the lack of annotated datasets. In this paper, we present a unified framework to the complete intelligent media analysis, where we propose a shared parameter layer architecture with a joint learning approach that takes advantage of each separate task for the classification of sentiments, emotions, irony, and hate speech in texts. The proposed approach was evaluated on Greek expert-annotated texts from social media posts, news articles, and internet articles such as blog posts and opinion pieces. The results show that this joint classification approach improves the classification effectiveness of each task in terms of the micro-averaged F1-score. © 2023 by the authors."
"Using advanced algorithms to conduct a thematic analysis reduces the time taken and increases the efficiency of the analysis. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is effective in the field of text classification and natural language processing (NLP). In this study, we adopt LSTM for text classification in order to perform a thematic analysis using concordance lines that are taken from a corpora of news articles. However, the statistical and quantitative analyses of corpus linguistics are not enough to fully identify the semantic shift of terms and concepts. Therefore, we suggest that a corpus should be classified from a linguistic theoretical perspective, as this would help to determine the level of the linguistic patterns that should be applied in the experiment of the classification process. We suggest investigating the concordance lines of the articles rather than only the relationship between collocates, as this has been a limitation for many studies. The findings of this research work highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for the thematic analysis of media coverage, reaching 84% accuracy. This method provides a deeper thematic analysis than only applying the classification process through the collocational analysis. © 2023 by the authors."
"Biomedical image analysis algorithm validation depends on high-quality annotation of reference datasets, for which labelling instructions are key. Despite their importance, their optimization remains largely unexplored. Here we present a systematic study of labelling instructions and their impact on annotation quality in the field. Through comprehensive examination of professional practice and international competitions registered at the Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention Society, the largest international society in the biomedical imaging field, we uncovered a discrepancy between annotators’ needs for labelling instructions and their current quality and availability. On the basis of an analysis of 14,040 images annotated by 156 annotators from four professional annotation companies and 708 Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworkers using instructions with different information density levels, we further found that including exemplary images substantially boosts annotation performance compared with text-only descriptions, while solely extending text descriptions does not. Finally, professional annotators constantly outperform Amazon Mechanical Turk crowdworkers. Our study raises awareness for the need of quality standards in biomedical image analysis labelling instructions. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"China’s outbreak related to cold-chain aquatic product quality and safety in 2020 caused public panic and further led to a crisis in China’s aquatic industry. This paper uses topic clustering and emotion analysis methods to text-mine the comments of netizens on Sina Weibo to study the main features of the public’s views on the administration’s crisis management measures and to provide experience for future imported food safety management. The findings show that for the imported food safety incident and the risk of virus infection, the public response had four types of characteristics: a higher proportion of negative emotion; a wider range of information demand; attention paid to the whole imported food industry chain; and a differentiated attitude towards control policies. Based on the online public response, countermeasures to further improve the management ability of imported food safety crises are proposed as follows: the government should pay active attention to the development trend of online public opinion; work more on exploring the content of public concern and emotion; strengthen the risk assessment of imported food and establish the classification and management measures of imported food safety events; construct the imported food safety traceability system; build a special recall mechanism for imported food safety; and improve the cooperation between government and media, enhancing the public’s trust in policies. © 2023 by the authors."
"Objective: In the past, studies on antimicrobial resistance were carried out on pathogens in the clinical areas. However, since then, this phenomenon has become a general case both in the environment and in the food sector. This systematic review aimed to review the various scientific publications on the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics in foods in West Africa. Methods: An extensive literature search was carried out through an electronic database including PubMed, Google Scholar, Research Gate, and African Journals Online (AJOL). Articles published from fifteen countries of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) between 2010 and 2020 on antibiotic resistance of foodborne pathogens were included in the study. The titles and abstracts of the retrieved articles and then the full texts of the selected articles were reviewed. Results: Out of the 565 articles found in our initial research, 149 publications (26.55%) were considered suitable for inclusion in this review. Globally, 2018, 2019, and 2020 had more included papers (n = 21 to 25) than the other years. Of the 149 publications analyzed, four types of food commodities were identified as products of high consumption based on the number of publications in the field such as poultry (39/149), read‐to‐eat food (22/149), meat, and animal products (20/149). Most studies have shown that E. coli has the highest prevalence followed by Salmonella and Staphylococcus. Only 33 (22.14%) of the 149 publications were based on further molecular characterization of the isolates. Publications analyzed showed that the most prevalent detected genes were tet(A), tet(B), tet(C), tet(K) blaTEM, catA1, catA2, cmlA, blaCTXM and qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, parC, and qepA4. Conclusion: From these results, antibiotic use in the food areas must be strongly regulated, especially in developing countries, particularly in Africa. This highlights the need to implement suitable and appropriate control strategies to reduce complications and prevent the dissemination of resistant bacteria isolates in foods. One health antimicrobial resistance surveillance system in the region must be a great concern. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a condition requiring 24-hour management. The way in which an individual combines their 24-hour movement behaviours (24-h MBs), which is comprised of physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour (SB), and sleep, throughout the day can have a significant impact on physical and mental health. This mixed methods systematic review aimed to investigate 24-h MBs’ relationship with glycaemic control and psychosocial outcomes in adolescents (11–18 years) with T1D. Ten databases were searched for quantitative and qualitative English language articles reporting at least one of the behaviours and their relationship with outcomes. There were no restrictions on article publication dates or study design. Articles were subjected to title and abstract screening, full text screening, data extraction and quality assessment. Data were summarised narratively, and a meta-analysis was conducted where possible. From 9922 studies, 84 were included for data extraction (quantitative (n = 76), qualitative (n = 8)). Meta-analyses revealed a significant favourable association between PA and HbA1c (−0.22 [95% CI: −0.35, −0.08; I2 = 92.7%; p = 0.001). SB had an insignificant unfavourable association with HbA1c (0.12 [95% CI: −0.06, 0.28; I2 = 86.1%; p = 0.07]) and sleep had an insignificant favourable association (−0.03 [95% CI: −0.21, 0.15; I2 = 65.9%; p = 0.34]). Importantly, no study investigated how combinations of behaviours collectively interacted and impacted on outcomes. © 2023 by the authors."
"BACKGROUND: Evidence of effective early childhood obesity prevention is scarce and mainly derived from face-to-face interventions. However, the COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced face-to-face health programmes globally. This study assessed effectiveness of a telephone-based intervention in reducing obesity risk of young children. METHODS: We adapted a study protocol (developed before the pandemic) and conducted a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of 662 women with children aged 2 years (mean age 24·06 months [SD 0·69]) during March, 2019, and October, 2021, extending the original planned intervention of 12 months to 24 months. The adapted intervention comprised five telephone-based support sessions plus text messages over a 24-month period (at child ages 24-26 months, 28-30 months, 32-34 months, 36-38 months, and 42-44 months). The intervention group (n=331) received staged telephone plus SMS support regarding healthy eating, physical activity, and information about COVID-19. The control group (n=331) received four staged mail-outs on information not related to the obesity prevention intervention, such as toilet training, language development, and sibling relationships, as a retention strategy. The intervention effects on BMI (primary outcome) and eating habits (secondary outcome), and perceived co-benefits, were evaluated using surveys and qualitative telephone interviews at 12 months and 24 months after baseline (age 2 years). The trial is registered with the Australian Clinical Trial Registry, ACTRN12618001571268. FINDINGS: Of 662 mothers, 537 (81%) completed the follow-up assessments at 3 years, and 491 (74%) completed the follow-up assessment at 4 years. Multiple imputation analysis showed no significant difference in mean BMI between the groups. Among low-income families (ie, annual household income <AU$80 000) at age 3 years, the intervention was significantly associated with a lower mean BMI (16·26 kg/m2 [SD 2·22]) in the intervention group than in the control group (16·84 kg/m2 [2·37]; p=0·040), a difference of -0·59 (95% CI -1·15 to -0·03; p=0·040). Children in the intervention group were more likely not to eat in front of the television than the control group, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 2·00 (95% CI 1·33 to 2·99) at 3 years and an aOR of 2·50 (1·63 to 3·83) at 4 years. Qualitative interviews with 28 mothers revealed that the intervention increased their awareness, confidence, and motivation to implement healthy feeding practices, particularly for families from culturally diverse backgrounds (ie, speaking a language other than English at home). INTERPRETATION: A telephone-based intervention was well received by the mothers who participated in the study. The intervention could reduce children's BMI from low-income families. Telephone-based support targeted at low-income families and families from culturally diverse backgrounds could reduce current inequalities in childhood obesity. FUNDING: The trial was funded under the NSW Health Translational Research Grant Scheme 2016 (number TRGS 200) and also by a National Health and Medical Research Council Partnership grant (number 1169823).

"At present, websites, such as Amazon and Yelp, permit consumers to submit reviews for different businesses, services, and products. In recent times, the customer’s shopping decision is highly influenced by the online reviews posted by the customers using star ratings, as well as, texts. Generally, customers believe that ratings are consistent with the reviews provided, but it may not be in the case of intermediate ratings. Conversely, the reviews posted by the customers will be in an unstructured format, which makes it highly complicated in understanding and analysis of the review, thereby requiring efficient approaches to estimate ratings considering the sentiment of the customer. In this paper, a novel sentiment rating prediction approach is devised by utilizing a deep learning network with hybrid optimization. Here, Random Multimodel Deep Learning (RMDL) network is used to estimate the sentiment rating, where the RMDL is trained using the devised Honey-based Exponential Poor Rich Optimization (HEPRO) algorithm. Moreover, the presented HEPRO-RMDL is examined for its effectiveness based on various metrics, like True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and accuracy is observed to have achieved high values of accuracy, TNR, and TPR at 0.935, 0.925, and 0.956, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
"Food insecurity is prevalent, affecting 1·2 billion people globally in 2021. However, the effects of food insecurity are unequally distributed across populations and climate-related shocks threaten to exacerbate food insecurity and associated health consequences. The mechanisms underlying this exacerbation at the household level are largely unknown. We aimed to synthesise the available evidence on the mechanisms connecting extreme climate events to household-level food insecurity and highlight the research gaps that must be addressed to inform better food security and health policy. For this systematic review, a comprehensive literature search was done by a medical librarian in February, 2021 for articles about food security and climate-related shocks. Relevant publications were identified by searching the following databases with a combination of standardised index terms and keywords: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, GreenFILE, Environment Complete, Web of Science Core Collection, and Global Health. Searches were limited to human studies published in English. Included studies measured food security outcomes using indicators developed by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (ie, consumption patterns, livelihood change, malnutrition, and mortality) and explained the mechanism behind the household-level or population-level food insecurity. Purely theoretical, modelling, and review studies were excluded. Quality assessment was conducted using the appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. Data were analysed using thematic analysis of the categories of mechanism (interpreted using internationally accepted frameworks), risk and resilience factors, and author policy recommendations. We found a paucity of data with only 18 studies meeting criteria for inclusion out of 337 studies identified for full-text review. All the studies that were included in our analysis showed worse food security outcomes after climate-related shocks. Food availability was the most common mechanism cited (17 studies), although most studies addressed at least one additional mechanism (15 studies). Studies were of mixed methodologies with nuanced discussions of risk and resilience factors, and of policy recommendations. This systematic review shows that there is an incomplete assessment of food security at the household and community level after climate-related shocks in the literature and finds that food availability is the primary mechanism studied. The low number of studies on this topic limits subgroup analysis and generalisability; however, the good quality of the studies allows for important policy recommendations around improving resilience to climate shocks and suggestions for future research including the need for a more granular understanding of mechanisms and feasible adaptation solutions. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Introduction The aim of this review was to evaluate the impact of preoperative myosteatosis on long-term outcomes following surgery for gastrointestinal malignancy. Methods We conducted a systematic search of the electronic information sources, including PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), CINAHL and AMED. Studies were included if they reported the impact of preoperatively defined myosteatosis, or a similar term, on long-term survival outcomes following surgery for gastrointestinal malignancy. A subgroup analysis was performed for those studies reporting outcomes for colorectal cancer patients only. Findings Thirty-nine full-text articles were reviewed for inclusion, with 19 being retained after the inclusion criteria were applied. The total number of included patients across all studies was 14,481. Patients with myosteatosis had significantly poorer overall survival, according to univariate (hazard ratio (HR) 1.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67–1.99) and multivariable (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.49–1.86) analysis. This was also demonstrated for cancer-specific survival (univariate HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.18–2.22; multivariable HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.48–2.03) and recurrence-free survival (univariate HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10–1.48; multivariable HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.07–1.77). Conclusions This meta-analysis demonstrates that patients with preoperative myosteatosis have poorer long-term survival outcomes following surgery for gastrointestinal malignancy. Therefore, myosteatosis should be used for preoperative optimisation and as a prognostic tool before surgery. More standardised definitions of myosteatosis and further cohort studies of patients with non-colorectal malignancies are required. © 2023 Royal College of Surgeons of England. All rights reserved."
"Data sources: The authors searched Medline via Pubmed, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Scielo. Additionally, grey literature was also searched with no restrictions regarding date of publication and journal up to March 2022. The search was conducted by two pre-calibrated independent reviewers using AMSTAR 2 and PRISMA checklists. Both MeSH terms, relevant free text and their combinations were utilised to conduct the search. Study selection: The authors screened the articles on the basis of their titles and abstracts. Duplicates were removed. Full-text publications were evaluated. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion amongst themselves or with a third reviewer. Only the systematic reviews that included RCTs and CCTs were included involving the articles comparing nonsurgical periodontal treatment alone vs no treatment or nonsurgical periodontal treatment with adjunctive therapeutic modality (antibiotics, laser) vs no treatment or nonsurgical periodontal therapy alone. PICO method was used to define the inclusion criteria and changes in glycated haemoglobin post-intervention 3 months was taken as primary outcome. All the articles with the use of adjunctive therapy other than antibiotics (local or systemic) or laser were excluded. The selection was restricted to English only. Data extraction and synthesis: Data extraction was performed by two reviewers. For each systematic review and each study, mean and standard deviation of glycated hemoglobin level at each follow-up, number of patients both in intervention and control group, type of diabetes, design of study, follow-up period, number of comparisons in meta-analysis, quality assessment of systematic review was assessed by 16 items AMSTAR 2 (Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews) and 27 itemed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) checklist. JADAD scale was used to assess the risk of bias for included RCTs. Q test was used to calculate statistical heterogeneity and percentage of variation by I2 Index. Both Fixed (Mantel-Haenszel [Peto] test) and random (Dersimonian-Laird test) models were used to estimate individual study. Funnel plot and Egger’s linear regression methods were used to evaluate publication bias. Results: Following initial electronic and hand search, 1062 articles were screened for title and abstract and 112 articles were considered for full text eligibility. Finally, 16 systematic reviews were considered for qualitative synthesis of results. 16 systematic reviews described 30 unique meta-analyses. Publication bias was assessed in nine out of 16 systematic reviews. Compared to control or non-treatment group, nonsurgical periodontal therapy resulted in statistically significant mean difference of −0.49% HBA1c reduction at 3 months (p = 0.0041), −0.38% (p = 0.0851). The effect of periodontal therapy with antibiotics compared to NSPT alone was not statistically significant (CI −0.32–0.06, 3 months; CI −0.31–0.53, 6 month). The effect of NSPT and laser vs NSPT for HbA1c was not statistically significant (CI −0.73–0.17, 3–4 month). Conclusions: Based on included systematic reviews and limitations within the study, nonsurgical periodontal therapy is an effective treatment modality in glycaemic control in diabetic patients in terms of HbA1c reduction both at 3 months and 6 months follow-up. The adjunctive therapies like antibiotic administration whether local or systemic and use of lasers with NSPT does not show statistically significant differences as compared to NSPT alone. However, these findings are based on analysis of available literature based on systematic reviews on this subject. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to British Dental Association."
"Background: Digital health interventions have shown promising results for the management of type 2 diabetes, but a comparison of the effectiveness and implementation of the different modes is not currently available. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of SMS, smartphone application, and website-based interventions on improving glycaemia in adults with type 2 diabetes and report on their reach, uptake, and feasibility. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo on May 25, 2022, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effectiveness of digital health interventions in reducing glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) in adults with type 2 diabetes, published in English from Jan 1, 2009. Screening was carried out using Covidence, and data were extracted following Cochrane's guidelines. The primary endpoint assessed was the change in the mean (and 95% CI) plasma concentration of HbA1c at 3 months or more. Cochrane risk of bias 2 was used to assess risk of bias. Data on reach, uptake, and feasibility were summarised narratively and data on HbA1c reduction were synthesised in a meta-analysis. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation criteria was used to evaluate the level of evidence. The study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42021247845. Findings: Of the 3236 records identified, 56 RCTs from 24 regions (n=11 486 participants), were included in the narrative synthesis, and 26 studies (n=4546 participants) in the meta-analysis. 20 studies used SMS as the primary mode of delivery of the digital health intervention, 25 used smartphone applications, and 11 implemented interventions via websites. Smartphone application interventions reported higher reach compared with SMS and website-based interventions, but website-based interventions reported higher uptake compared with SMS and smartphone application interventions. Effective interventions, in general, included people with greater severity of their condition at baseline (ie, higher HbA1c) and administration of a higher dose intensity of the intervention, such as more frequent use of smartphone applications. Overall, digital health intervention group participants had a –0·30 (95% CI –0·42 to –0·19) percentage point greater reduction in HbA1c, compared with control group participants. The difference in HbA1c reduction between groups was statistically significant when interventions were delivered through smartphone applications (–0·42% [–0·63 to –0·20]) and via SMS (–0·37% [–0·57 to –0·17]), but not when delivered via websites (–0·09% [–0·64 to 0·46]). Due to the considerable heterogeneity between included studies, the level of evidence was moderate overall. Interpretation: Smartphone application and SMS interventions, but not website-based interventions, were associated with better glycaemic control. However, the studies' heterogeneity should be recognised. Considering that both smartphone application and SMS interventions are effective for diabetes management, clinicians should consider factors such as reach, uptake, patient preference, and context of the intervention when deciding on the mode of delivery of the intervention. Nine in ten people worldwide own a feature phone and can receive SMS and four in five people have access to a smartphone, with numerous smartphone applications being available for diabetes management. Clinicians should familiarise themselves with this modality of programme delivery and encourage people with type 2 diabetes to use evidence-based applications for improving their self-management of diabetes. Future research needs to describe in detail the mediators and moderators of the effectiveness and implementation of SMS and smartphone application interventions, such as the optimal dose, frequency, timing, user interface, and communication mode to both further improve their effectiveness and to increase their reach, uptake, and feasibility.

"This multiliteracies-framed study is an analysis of how English Language Arts students designed digital portfolios across three digital media platforms: Weebly (a website building platform), blogs, and Instagram (a photo and video sharing app). Analysis centers around an examination of students’ writing (defined broadly), student surveys, focal student interviews, and a reflective interview with the teacher to understand the research question: How did students use each of the platforms and what did this afford that may not have otherwise been possible in this typically formal and text-based class? Findings indicate that the students designed complex, reflective, multimodal compositions that would have otherwise not been possible with the typically formal, prescribed forms of writing typical to this classroom. Implications for this study include embracing alternative communication styles in classrooms beyond traditional forms of text-based writing to allow for students’ out-of-school and in-school literacy practices to be bridged. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"Information Security Awareness (ISA) is a significant concept that got considerable attention recently and can assist in minimizing the risks associated with information security breaches. Several measurement scales have been developed in this regard, as measuring users’ ISA is paramount. Although ISA specific scales are very important, yet what methodological rigor they use in terms of initial conceptualization of ISA, data collection and analysis during the development, and scale validation of such scales are some unknown aspects. Therefore, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing ISA specific scales to address all the above concerns. A popular method, PRISMA, is utilized, and a total of 24 articles that match with criteria of this research are included for the final in-depth analysis. Also, a holistic evaluation framework is developed containing three phases and 19 criteria. Findings revealed that most studies treat ISA as a multi-dimensional construct, and ISA researchers rarely conduct both pilot testing and pre-text evaluation while validating and refining the initial scales. Additionally, several articles did not report some of the essential elements used for checking the rigor of factor analysis, and evidence for validities of the identified scales is inadequate. Consequently, existing ISA specific scales must be improved both in terms of the methodological thoroughness of the scale development procedure and their validities. Moreover, not only justifying why the development of a new scale is necessary, but also improving the quality of the existing scales by doing multiple iterations is significant in the future. Likewise, the inclusion of all the dimensions of ISA, while generating the initial items pool is an important aspect to be considered. A thorough discussion, recommendations for future research, conclusions, and study limitations are provided. © 2023 The Authors"
"Transperineal laser ablation (TPLA) of the prostate is a new minimally invasive treatment option in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) due to benign prostatic enlargement (BPE). The aim of this systematic review was to investigate the efficacy and safety of TPLA in the management of BPE. The primary outcomes were the improvement in urodynamic parameters (maximum urinary flow (Qmax) and postvoiding residue (PVR)) and LUTS relief, assessed using the IPSS questionnaire. The secondary outcomes were the preservation of sexual and ejaculatory functions, assessed with the IEEF-5 and MSHQ-EjD questionnaires, respectively, and rates of postoperative complications. We reviewed the literature for prospective or retrospective studies evaluating the use of TPLA in the treatment of BPE. A comprehensive search in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed for English language articles published between January 2000 and June 2022. Pooled analysis of the included studies with available follow-up data for the outcomes of interest was additionally performed. After screening 49 records, six full-text manuscripts were identified, including two retrospective and four prospective non-comparative studies. Overall, 297 patients were included. All the studies independently reported a statistically significant improvement, from baseline, in Qmax, PVR, and IPSS score at each timepoint. Three studies additionally demonstrated that TPLA did not affect sexual function, reporting no change in the IEEF-5 score, and a statistically significant improvement in MSHQ-EjD score at each timepoint. Low rates of complications were recorded in all the included studies. Pooled analysis showed a clinically meaningful improvement in both micturition and sexual outcomes mean values at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months of follow-up, compared with baseline. Transperineal laser ablation of the prostate for the treatment of BPE showed interesting results in pilot studies. However, higher level and comparative studies are needed to confirm its efficacy in relieving obstructive symptoms and preserving sexual function. © 2023 by the authors."
"Data sources: Electronic databases PubMed, Scopus and Embase were systematically searched and restricted to articles published between February 2009 and 2022. Study selection: Studies were categorized using the modified method by the Swedish Council of Technology Assessment in Health Care. 20 studies were included, one of which was categorized as high quality (Grade A) and 19 of which were of moderate quality (Grade B). Exclusion criteria included articles with insufficient descriptions of reliability and reproducibility testing, review articles and case reports, and studies including traumatised teeth. Data extraction and synthesis: Three independent authors examined titles, abstracts and full texts of relevant articles against the inclusion criteria. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. Retrieved studies were assessed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data extracted included tooth movement performed, the appliance and force used, follow-up of subjects, changes in pulpal blood flow (PBF), tooth sensibility, expression of inflammation-related proteins, along with pulpal histology and morphology changes during tooth movement (intrusion, extrusion and tipping). Overall risk of bias was unclear. Results: A reduction in pulpal blood flow and tooth sensibility due to the application of orthodontic forces was reported by studies included in the review. Increases in the activity of proteins and enzymes related to inflammation of the pulp was reported. Two studies reported histological changes of the pulpal tissues related to orthodontic treatment. Conclusions: Orthodontic forces cause multiple temporary detectable changes in the dental pulp. The authors conclude there are no clear signs of permanent pulpal damage to healthy teeth due to the application of orthodontic forces. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to British Dental Association."
"Objective: Cervical lymphadenopathy is a frequent finding in children that poses diagnostic challenges. We sought to compare the utility of fine needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasound (US) for evaluating pediatric cervical lymphadenopathy based on published literature. Study design: In October 2019, we performed a comprehensive electronic search of PubMed, OVID (MEDLINE), EMBASE, and Scopus databases. Two authors independently screened and assessed full-text reports of potentially eligible studies. We compared sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value estimates, and balanced accuracy for determining the underlying etiology of lymphadenopathy. Results: The initial search returned 7736 possible studies, of which 31 met the criteria for inclusion. A total of 25 studies were included in the final analysis, with a total of 4721 patients, of which 52.8% were male. Of these, 9 (36.0%) examined US, and 16 (64%) examined fine needle aspiration. The pooled balanced accuracy for determining etiology was 87.7% for US and 92.9% for FNA. Reactive lymphadenopathy was identified in 47.9%, 9.2% were malignant, 12.6% were granulomatous, and 6.6% were non-diagnostic. Conclusions: In this systematic review, US was identified as an accurate initial diagnostic imaging modality in children. Fine needle aspiration was found to play a significant role in ruling out malignant lesions and potentially avoiding excisional biopsy. © 2023"
"The use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) feed additives to improve animal performance are on the increase; however, the results of the action of SC supplementation on goats performance indices are conflicting. Thus, the thrust of this meta-analysis was to examine the influence of dietary SC intervention on the growth performance, haemato-biochemical indices and ruminal fermentation characteristics of growing goats fed total mixed ration (TMR). The search conducted in Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus databases using several keywords yielded 500 studies of which 16 full-text articles were utilised for study. Response variables were aggregated via a random-effects model. The results showed that goats fed SC experienced higher average daily gain (ADG) than the controls (as standardized mean difference, SMD = 2.14; 95% confidence interval, CI: 1.40 to 2.89). In converse, dietary SC intervention had a small impact on dry matter intake (DMI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that SC type (active vs inactive) improved FCR and ADG in growing goats. Results suggested that SC preparation increased blood glucose, white blood cell (WBC), ruminal propionate and total volatile fatty acid levels. There is heterogeneity among the articles used in the study, and aspects of studied covariates explained the variation. In conclusion, this study indicated that dietary yeast can positively influence growth performance, haemato-biochemical indices, and rumen fermentation parameters of growing goats. © 2023 The Authors"
"Gambling disorder is a major public health issue in many countries. It has been defined as a persistent, recurrent pattern of gambling and is associated with substantial distress or impairment, lower quality of life, and living with a plurality of psychiatric problems. Many people suffering from gambling disorder seek help in ways other than formal treatment seeking, including self-management strategies. One example of responsible gambling tools that has gained popularity in recent years is self-exclusion programs. Self-exclusion entails individuals barring themselves from a gambling venue or a virtual platform. The aim of this scoping review is to summarize the literature on this topic and to explore participants’ perceptions and experiences with self-exclusion. An electronic literature search was conducted on 16th May 2022 in the following databases: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Plus with Full Text, Education Source, ERIC, MEDLINE with Full Text, APA PsycArticles, Psychology and Behavioral Sciences Collection, APA PsychInfo, Social Work Abstracts, and SocINDEX. The search yielded a total of 236 articles, of which 109 remained after duplicates were removed. After full-text reading, six articles were included in this review. The available literature shows that although there are many barriers and limitations to the current self-exclusion programs, self-exclusion is generally viewed as an effective responsible gambling strategy. There is a clear need to improve the current programs by increasing awareness, publicity, availability, staff training, off-site venue exclusion, and technology-assisted monitoring, as well as by adopting more holistic management approaches to gambling disorders in general. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Growing evidence supports exercise for people with lung cancer. This overview aimed to summarise exercise intervention efficacy and safety across the care continuum. Methods: Eight databases (including Cochrane and Medline) were searched (inception—February 2022) for systematic reviews of RCTs/quasi-RCTs. Eligibility: population—adults with lung cancer; intervention: exercise (e.g., aerobic, resistance) +/− non-exercise (e.g., nutrition); comparator: usual care/non-exercise; primary outcomes: exercise capacity, physical function, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and post-operative complications. Duplicate, independent title/abstract and full-text screening, data extraction and quality ratings (AMSTAR-2) were completed. Results: Thirty systematic reviews involving between 157 and 2109 participants (n = 6440 total) were included. Most reviews (n = 28) involved surgical participants. Twenty-five reviews performed meta-analyses. The review quality was commonly rated critically low (n = 22) or low (n = 7). Reviews commonly included combinations of aerobic, resistance and/or respiratory exercise interventions. Pre-operative meta-analyses demonstrated that exercise reduces post-operative complications (n = 4/7) and improves exercise capacity (n = 6/6), whilst HRQoL findings were non-significant (n = 3/3). Post-operative meta-analyses reported significant improvements in exercise capacity (n = 2/3) and muscle strength (n = 1/1) and non-significant HRQoL changes (n = 8/10). Interventions delivered to mixed surgical and non-surgical populations improved exercise capacity (n = 3/4), muscle strength (n = 2/2) and HRQoL (n = 3). Meta-analyses of interventions in non-surgical populations demonstrated inconsistent findings. Adverse event rates were low, however, few reviews reported on safety. Conclusions: A large body of evidence supports lung cancer exercise interventions to reduce complications and improve exercise capacity in pre- and post-operative populations. Additional higher-quality research is needed, particularly in the non-surgical population, including subgroup analyses of exercise type and setting. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Self-measured blood pressure monitoring (SMBP) is essential to effective management of hypertension. This study aims to evaluate effectiveness and implementation of SMBP that leverages: cellular-enabled home BP monitors without a need for Wi-Fi or Bluetooth; simple communication modalities such as text messaging to support patient engagement; and integration into existing team-based workflows in safety-net clinics. Methods: This study will be conducted with patients in San Francisco who are treated within a network of safety-net clinics. English and Spanish-speaking patients with diagnosed hypertension will be eligible for the trial if they have recent BP readings ≥140/90 mmHg and do not have co-morbid conditions that make home BP monitoring more complex to manage. This study will implement a three-arm randomized controlled trial to compare varying levels of implementation support: 1) cellular-enabled BP monitors (with minimal implementation support), 2) cellular-enabled BP monitors with protocol-based implementation support (text reminders for patients; aggregated BP summaries sent to primary care providers), and 3) cellular-enabled BP monitors and pharmacist-led support (pharmacist coaching and independent medication adjustments). Results: For the main analysis, we will use mixed effects linear regression to compare the change in primary outcome of systolic BP. Secondary outcomes include BP control (<140/90 mmHg), medication intensification, patient-reported outcomes, and implementation processes (i.e., engagement with the intervention). Discussion: This study will design and test a digital health intervention for use in marginalized populations treated within safety net settings, evaluating both effectiveness and implementation to advance more equitable health outcomes. © 2023 The Authors"
"Objectives: Socioeconomic status is well established as a key determinant of inequalities in health outcomes. Existing literature examining the impact of socioeconomic status on outcomes in critical care has produced inconsistent findings. Our objective was to synthesize the available evidence on the association between socioeconomic status and outcomes in critical care. Data Sources: A systematic search of CINAHL, Ovid MEDLINE, and EMBASE was undertaken on September 13, 2022. Study Selection: Observational cohort studies of adults assessing the association between socioeconomic status and critical care outcomes including mortality, length of stay, and functional outcomes were included. Two independent reviewers assessed titles, abstracts, and full texts against eligibility and quality criteria. Data Extraction: Details of study methodology, population, exposure measures, and outcomes were extracted. Data Synthesis: Thirty-eight studies met eligibility criteria for systematic review. Twenty-Three studies reporting mortality to less than or equal to 30 days following critical care admission, and eight reporting length of stay, were included in meta-Analysis. Random-effects pooled analysis showed that lower socioeconomic status was associated with higher mortality at less than or equal to 30 days following critical care admission, with pooled odds ratio of 1.13 (95% CIs, 1.05-1.22). Meta-Analysis of ICU length of stay demonstrated no significant difference between socioeconomic groups. Socioeconomic status may also be associated with functional status and discharge destination following ICU admission. Conclusions: Lower socioeconomic status was associated with higher mortality following admission to critical care. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved."
"This study examines the impact of environmental information disclosure quality on firm value for Chinese listed companies in heavily polluting industries from 2010 to 2021. By controlling for the level of leverage, growth, and corporate governance, a fixed effects model is constructed to test this relationship. Furthermore, this study analyzes the moderating effects of annual report text features, such as length, similarity, and readability, on the relationship between environmental information disclosure and firm value and the heterogeneous impact of firm ownership on this relationship. The main findings of this study are as follows: There is a positive correlation between the level of environmental information disclosure and firm value for Chinese listed companies in heavily polluting industries. Annual report text length and readability positively moderate the relationship between environmental information disclosure and firm value. Annual report text similarity negatively moderates the relationship between environmental information disclosure and firm value performance. Compared with state-owned enterprises, the impact of environmental information disclosure quality on the firm value of no-state-owned enterprises is more significant. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Basal metabolic index (BMI) is a unique anthropometric indicator used to define the relative amount of body fat on an individual’s frame. There are many diseases and conditions associated with obesity and underweight. Recent research trials suggest that there is a significant association between oral health indicators and BMI as both are attributed to common risk factors such as dietary, genetic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle issues. Objectives: The main objective of this review paper is to emphasize the association between BMI and oral health with available literature evidence. Methodology: A literature search was conducted using multiple databases comprising of MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, and Web of Science. The terms used for the search were “body mass index”, “periodontitis”, “dental caries”, and “tooth loss”. Results: In total, 2839 articles were obtained from the analysis of the databases. Unrelated articles from the available full text of 1135 articles were excluded. The main reasons for excluding the articles were: they were dietary guidelines and policy statements. A total of 66 studies were finally included in the review. Conclusion: The presence of dental caries, periodontitis and tooth loss may be associated with a higher BMI or obesity, whereas, improved oral health might be associated with lower BMI. Promoting general and oral health should be a hand in hand feature, as common risk factors can be embattled. © 2023 by the authors."
"Sentiment analysis is one of the most important tasks in natural language processing. The goal of sentiment analysis is to classify the text-based sentiment tendencies by extracting text features. The quality of the classification can be assessed by the accuracy, precision and recall of the classification. So it is very important to design efficient tools or models to carry out the classification process. In this paper, we build a novel model, integrating the dealing method of Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT), Bidirectional Long Short - Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) and the Multi-Head Attention (MHA), building an MHA based, integrating BERT and Bi-LSTM, Sentiment Analysis Model (MHA-BB-SAM). The model concludes two layers, the embedding layer and the Bi-LSTM layer. In the embedding layer, BERT is used to pre-process the text and train the required word vectors. In the Bi-LSTM layer, Bi-LSTM network is utilized to catch the order information of the context. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is introduced to enhance the ability to capture the long-distance text features. The novel model is tested on two corpuses, SemEval-2020 corpus and College Learners' Spoken English Corpus (COLSEC). The computing results prove the high performance of the model. The approach presented in this paper can provide a reference for the sentiment analysis work. © 2023,IAENG International Journal of Computer Science. All Rights Reserved."
"Introduction: This is an original research, the authors having not found in the specialized literature this kind of approach. The authors raise several questions related to the writings, testimonies, and autofictions published by the victims of attacks: Why tell yourself? What are the motivations that push a writer, an essayist, an anonymous person to tell the story of his life or a segment of his life? What triggers this need, this desire? Who are the recipients of these messages? Methodology: Analysis of victims’ texts (written by direct or indirect victims or their relatives) according to several parameters, including chronological succession – sometimes meticulous – events, the narration of personal experiences at distances sometimes very variable of the situations that inspire them. Analysis: This is a network analysis according to the method of comparative clinical epistemology which shows that: the literary structure and construction chosen by the authors are very varied, as are the literary genres mastered or sketched to which they belong. The roles of these texts and the functions to which the construction of such narratives responds differ according to the victims; we often find a remote function, a step back from a moment in his life that affects his future. Compared to the reader, the function of testimony and sharing does not seem a sufficient explanation while the need to make each disappeared live in the collective memory often appears to the victim as a necessity. The Narratology and Ricoeur's studies on identity and self-constitution have emphasized the richness of the notion of narrative unity of life while taking into account the difficulties it raises. Conclusion: The writings of victims account for an individual experience at different moments of the evolution of trauma and sequelae; the moment of transition to writing, near or at a distance of the attack is variable, as is the evolution of posttraumatic stress; as for the sequelae it is often appreciated differently by the victim, his entourage and professionals. © 2023"
"With the recent expansion of social media in the form of social networks, online portals, and microblogs, users have generated a vast number of opinions, reviews, ratings, and feedback. Businesses, governments, and individuals benefit greatly from this information. While this information is intended to be informative, a large portion of it necessitates the use of text mining and sentiment analysis models. It is a matter of concern that reviews on social media lack text context semantics. A model for sentiment classification for customer reviews based on manifold dimensions and manifold modeling is presented to fully exploit the sentiment data provided in reviews and handle the issue of the absence of text context semantics. This paper uses a deep learning framework to model review texts using two dimensions of language texts and ideogrammatic icons and three levels of documents, sentences, and words for a text context semantic analysis review that enhances the precision of the sentiment categorization process. Observations from the experiments show that the proposed model outperforms the current sentiment categorization techniques by more than 8.86%, with an average accuracy rate of 97.30%. © 2023 by the authors."
"In this paper, the as-cast microstructure, microsegregation, and the kinetics of (γ+γ′) eutectic phase and Laves phase dissolution in GH4151 alloy were studied by the optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and high-temperature water quenching text. The results show that W and Al elements are segregated into the dendrites arm, while Mo, Nb, and Ti are segregated into the interdendritic region. The initial melting point temperature of the MB2 phase was near 1100 °C, the redissolution temperature range of γ′ phase is 1130–1160 °C, the obvious dissolution temperature of Laves phase was above 1145 °C and the γ + γ′ eutectic phase was redissolved obviously above 1165 °C. Based on the JMAK analysis, the activation energies of dissolution of Laves phase (266.3 kJ/mol) and γ+γ′ phase (279.5 kJ/mol) are close to the activation energy for the diffusion of Mo in Ni (288.15 kJ/mol) and Ti in Ni (288.15 kJ/mol), respectively. The back-diffusion of Mo and Ti into austenite is controlling the micro-mechanism for the dissolution of Laves phase and (γ+γ′) eutectic phase, respectively. © 2023"
"Digitization, informatization, and Internet penetration have led to a significant rise in cross-border e-commerce (CBEC), attracting considerable interest from academia, government, and industry. This study employed a novel method combining automatic text generation technology and traditional bibliometric analysis to summarize and categorize the research on CBEC evolution from 2000 to 2021. Articles were selected and examined with a focus on four dimensions: customer, risk, supply chain, and platform. Contradictions in these dimensions were found to result in two major obstacles to CBEC development, namely, dataset sharing and platform scalability. These obstacles prevent research on cross-border platforms from moving beyond theory-based studies. Further research needs to examine how soft computing can be used to accelerate and remodel the global trade ecosystem. © 2022 Xi'an Jiaotong University"
"Background Epidemiological studies of interstitial lung disease (ILD) are limited by small numbers and tertiary care bias. Investigators have leveraged the widespread use of electronic health records (EHRs) to overcome these limitations, but struggle to extract patient-level, longitudinal clinical data needed to address many important research questions. We hypothesized that we could automate longitudinal ILD cohort development using the EHR of a large, community-based healthcare system. Study design and methods We applied a previously validated algorithm to the EHR of a community-based healthcare system to identify ILD cases between 2012–2020. We then extracted disease-specific characteristics and outcomes using fully automated data-extraction algorithms and natural language processing of selected free-text. Results We identified a community cohort of 5,399 ILD patients (prevalence = 118 per 100,000). Pulmonary function tests (71%) and serologies (54%) were commonly used in the diagnostic evaluation, whereas lung biopsy was rare (5%). IPF was the most common ILD diagnosis (n = 972, 18%). Prednisone was the most commonly prescribed medication (911, 17%). Nintedanib and pirfenidone were rarely prescribed (n = 305, 5%). ILD patients were high-utilizers of inpatient (40%/year hospitalized) and outpatient care (80%/year with pulmonary visit), with sustained utilization throughout the post-diagnosis study period. Discussion We demonstrated the feasibility of robustly characterizing a variety of patient-level utilization and health services outcomes in a community-based EHR cohort. This represents a substantial methodological improvement by alleviating traditional constraints on the accuracy and clinical resolution of such ILD cohorts; we believe this approach will make community-based ILD research more efficient, effective, and scalable.

"Background: Chronic stress, anxiety, and depression are psychological problems that can hurt young adults, interfering with their everyday function, academic achievement, and interpersonal relationships. This study aimed to assess the impact of Text4Hope, an online mental health service, on the psychological well-being of young adults. Methods: This study adopted both longitudinal and naturalistic controlled trial designs. It examined clinical outcomes in young adult (≤26 years old) subscribers of Text4Hope who completed surveys at baseline and six weeks and compared clinical parameters in two groups of subscribers. The first group comprised the intervention group (IG) (young adult subscribers who received once-daily supportive text messages for six weeks and completed sixth-week evaluation measures between 26 April and 12 July 2020), and the second group was the control group (CG) (young adult subscribers who joined Text4Hope in the same time frame and completed a baseline survey and were yet to receive any text messages). The prevalence of moderate to high stress, anxiety, and depression was measured at baseline and six weeks in the longitudinal study and between the two groups for the naturalistic controlled study using the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Inferential statistics, including the t-test, McNemar test, chi-square, and binary logistic regression analyses, were used to evaluate the differences in the prevalence and severity of the psychological symptoms. Results: In the longitudinal study, of the 9214 subscribers to Text4Hope who completed the baseline survey, 1047 (11.4%) were identified as youth. For the young adult subscribers who completed both the baseline and sixth-week surveys (n = 114), a significant reduction in the prevalence of moderate to high stress (8%) and likely GAD (20%) from baseline to six weeks was reported. Similarly, there was a significant reduction in the mean scores on the PSS-10, GAD-7, and Composite Mental Health score but not the PHQ-9 from baseline to six weeks. The largest reduction in mean scores was for the GAD-7 scale (18.4%), with a small effect size overall. For the naturalistic study, the IG included 173 young adult subscribers of Text4Hope who completed the sixth-week survey compared to 92 subscribers in the CG who completed the baseline survey during the designated period. There was a significantly lower prevalence for likely Moderate Depressive Disorder (MDD) (25.2%) and suicidal thoughts/thoughts of self-harm (48.4%), with a small effect size in the IG compared to the CG. Similarly, lower mean scores were reported for all outcome variables in the IG compared to the CG, with a small to medium effect size. The receipt of daily supportive text messages for six weeks resulted in significantly lower odds of both likely GAD and experiencing thoughts of self-harm or death wish while controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Conclusions: The Text4Hope service is an effective tool for mental health support for young adult subscribers. Young adults receiving the service exhibited a reduction in psychological symptoms, including thoughts of self-harm or death wish. This population-level intervention program can be used to effectively support young adult mental health and in suicide prevention programs. © 2023 by the authors."

"Objectives To explore women's experiences of over-the-counter and prescription medication advice and use during pregnancy. Design A study design consisting of an online survey and nested in-depth interviews with a subsample of participants. We analysed data from survey free-text responses and in-depth interviews using thematic analysis. Quantitative survey data is published elsewhere. Setting The UK. Participants Women were eligible if living in the UK, aged 16-45 years, were pregnant or had been pregnant in the last 5 years regardless of pregnancy outcome. A total of 7090 women completed the survey, and 34 women who collectively had experienced 68 pregnancies were subsequently interviewed. Results Medication prescribing and use during pregnancy was common. The prescribing, dispensing and taking of some advised medications were restricted through women's or prescribers' fear of fetal harm. Lack of adherence to national prescribing guidance, conflicting professional opinion and poor communication resulted in maternal anxiety, avoidable morbidity and women negotiating complex and distressing pathways to obtain recommended medications. In contrast, some women felt overmedicated and that pharmacological treatments were used without exploring other options first. Conclusion Increased translation of national guidance into practice and greater personalisation of antenatal care are needed to improve the safety, efficacy and personalisation of prescribing in pregnancy.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"Background: Natural Language Processing (NLP) is widely used to extract clinical insights from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, the lack of annotated data, automated tools, and other challenges hinder the full utilisation of NLP for EHRs. Various Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and NLP techniques are studied and compared to understand the limitations and opportunities in this space comprehensively. Methodology: After screening 261 articles from 11 databases, we included 127 papers for full-text review covering seven categories of articles: (1) medical note classification, (2) clinical entity recognition, (3) text summarisation, (4) deep learning (DL) and transfer learning architecture, (5) information extraction, (6) Medical language translation and (7) other NLP applications. This study follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Result and Discussion: EHR was the most commonly used data type among the selected articles, and the datasets were primarily unstructured. Various ML and DL methods were used, with prediction or classification being the most common application of ML or DL. The most common use cases were: the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) classification, clinical note analysis, and named entity recognition (NER) for clinical descriptions and research on psychiatric disorders. Conclusion: We find that the adopted ML models were not adequately assessed. In addition, the data imbalance problem is quite important, yet we must find techniques to address this underlining problem. Future studies should address key limitations in studies, primarily identifying Lupus Nephritis, Suicide Attempts, perinatal self-harmed and ICD-9 classification. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"Background: Sustainability is becoming an increasingly important issue in higher education (HE). Leadership statements in university sustainability reports (LSUSR) represent a unique genre for university leaders to communicate sustainability. This study aims to demystify the genre so that future leadership statements might be crafted with a greater degree of reflexivity. Literature review: Sustainability discourse in HE has been regarded as a legitimacy tool and an opportunity for image improvement for universities. Some studies have examined university sustainability reports, whereas there is a lack of studies focusing on the section of leadership statements. Research question: Are there any cross-cultural similarities or differences in terms of rhetorical moves and communicative purposes between the Italian LSUSR genre and the American LSUSR genre? Research methodology: Using cross-cultural genre analysis, this study investigates the rhetorical moves of leadership statements produced by Italian and American universities. A move scheme is established and is used to annotate the sample texts. Results and conclusion: The findings show that although the Italian and American LSUSR genres share the communicative purpose of establishing a sustainable image, the degree of discourse force exerting on this communicative purpose varies. The image-building discourse force appears to be more noticeable in the American leadership statements, which tend to use a wider range and a larger quantity of image-improving moves. The Italian subcorpus, on the other hand, seems to pay more attention to the genre function of report-introducing, which is not explicitly linked to image improvement. This article suggests that practitioners could consider the potentials of the LSUSR genre in developing an institutional culture of sustainability.  © 1988-2012 IEEE."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are used in many dimensions of our lives, including education. Motivated by the increasing use of AI technologies and the current state of the art, this study examines research on AI from the perspective of online distance education. Following a systematic review protocol and using data mining and analytics approaches, the study examines a total of 276 publications. Accordingly, time trend analysis increases steadily with a peak in recent years, and China, India, and the United States are the leading countries in research on AI in online learning and distance education. Computer science and engineering are the research areas that make the most of the contribution, followed by social sciences. t-SNE analysis reveals three dominant clusters showing thematic tendencies, which are as follows: (1) how AI technologies are used in online teaching and learning processes, (2) how algorithms are used for the recognition, identification, and prediction of students’ behaviors, and (3) adaptive and personalized learning empowered through artificial intelligence technologies. Additionally, the text mining and social network analysis identified three broad research themes, which are (1) educational data mining, learning analytics, and artificial intelligence for adaptive and personalized learning; (2) algorithmic online educational spaces, ethics, and human agency; and (3) online learning through detection, identification, recognition, and prediction. © 2023 by the authors."
"STUDY QUESTION: What are the chances of achieving a live birth after embryo, oocyte and ovarian tissue cryopreservation (OTC) in female cancer survivors? SUMMARY ANSWER: The live birth rates (LBRs) following embryo and oocyte cryopreservation are 41% and 32%, respectively, while for IVF and spontaneous LBR after tissue cryopreservation and transplantation, these rates are 21% and 33%, respectively. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Currently, fertility preservation (FP) has become a major public health issue as diagnostic and therapeutic progress has made it possible to achieve an 80% survival rate in children, adolescents and young adults with cancer. In the latest ESHRE guidelines, only oocyte and embryo cryopreservation are considered as established options for FP. OTC is still considered to be an innovative method, while it is an acceptable FP technique in the American Society for Reproductive Medicine guidelines. However, given the lack of studies on long-term outcomes after FP, it is still unclear which technique offers the best chance to achieve a live birth. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published controlled studies. Searches were conducted from January 2004 to May 2021 in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library using the following search terms: cancer, stem cell transplantation, FP, embryo cryopreservation, oocyte vitrification, OTC and reproductive outcome. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: A total of 126 full-text articles were preselected from 1436 references based on the title and abstract and assessed via the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale. The studies were selected, and their data were extracted by two independent reviewers according to the Cochrane methods. A fixed-effect meta-analysis was performed for outcomes with high heterogeneity. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Data from 34 studies were used for this meta-analysis. Regarding cryopreserved embryos, the LBR after IVF was 41% (95% CI: 34-48, I2: 0%, fixed effect). Concerning vitrified oocytes, the LBR was 32% (95% CI: 26-39, I2: 0%, fixed effect). Finally, the LBR after IVF and the spontaneous LBR after ovarian tissue transplantation were 21% (95% CI: 15-26, I2: 0%, fixed-effect) and 33% (95% CI: 25-42, I2: 46.1%, random-effect), respectively. For all outcomes, in the sensitivity analyses, the maximum variation in the estimated percentage was 1%. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The heterogeneity of the literature prevents us from comparing these three techniques. This meta-analysis provides limited data which may help clinicians when counselling patients. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study highlights the need for long-term follow-up registries to assess return rates, as well as spontaneous pregnancy rates and birth rates after FP.

"Cell phone use while walking is an ever-increasing traffic hazard, and leads to an augmented risk of accidents. There is a rising number of injuries to pedestrians using a cell phone. Texting on a cell phone while walking is an emerging problem among people of different ages. The aim of this experiment was to investigate whether using a cell phone while walking affects walking velocity, as well as cadence, stride width, and length in young people. Forty-two subjects (20 males, 22 females; mean age: 20.74 ± 1.34 years; mean height: 173.21 ± 8.07 cm; mean weight: 69.05 ± 14.07 kg) participated in the study. The subjects were asked to walk on an FDM−1.5 dynamometer platform four times at a constant comfortable velocity and a fast velocity of their choice. They were asked to continuously type one sentence on a cell phone while walking at the same velocity. The results showed that texting while walking led to a significant reduction in velocity compared to walking without the phone. Width, cadence, and length of right and left single steps were statistically significantly influenced by this task. In conclusion, such changes in gait parameters may result in an increased risk of pedestrian crossing accidents and tripping while walking. Phone use is an activity that should be avoided while walking. © 2023 by the authors."
"Little is known about digital health interventions used to support treatment for pregnant and early parenting women (PEPW) with substance use disorders (SUD). Methods: Guided by the Arksey and O’Malley’s Scoping Review Framework, empirical studies were identified within the CINAHL, PsycInfo, PubMed, and ProQuest databases using subject headings and free-text keywords. Studies were selected based on a priori inclusion/exclusion criteria, and data extraction and descriptive analysis were performed. Results: A total of 27 original studies and 30 articles were included. Varying study designs were used, including several feasibility and acceptability studies. However, efficacious findings on abstinence and other clinically important outcomes were reported in several studies. Most studies focused on digital interventions for pregnant women (89.7%), suggesting a dearth of research on how digital technologies may support early parenting women with SUD. No studies included PEPW family members or involved PEPW women in the intervention design. Conclusions: The science of digital interventions to support treatment for PEPW is in an early stage, but feasibility and efficacy results are promising. Future research should explore community-based participatory partnerships with PEPW to develop or tailor digital interventions and include family or external support systems to engage in the intervention alongside PEPW. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: With the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, pharmacy students and educators experienced an abrupt shift as programmes that were previously taught exclusively in-person were then predominantly taught online. This sudden change provided little time for students to prepare for the new learning environment. Objectives: The study objective was to explore pharmacy students' experiences of technology-enhanced learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was developed and distributed by email to all 3rd year (N = 76) and 4th year (N = 68) pharmacy students undertaking an MPharm programme in an Irish university. Results: A total of 32 responses were collected, including 20 third year and 12 fourth year pharmacy students (response rates of 26.3% and 17.6%, respectively). The majority of respondents reported good or very good internet speed (71%) and stability (59%). Almost all were confident or very confident using Canvas (97%) prior to the onset of online learning. Respondents preferred engaging with other students in-person rather than online for coursework (68.8%) and learning new material (56.3%). Students favoured face-to-face delivery, with a recording of the session available online afterwards, for lectures (68.8%), workshops (50%) and tutorials (56.3%). Analysis of free-text comments indicates that respondents used recorded content to support exam revision and that a key drawback of online learning was social isolation. Implications: Pharmacy students favoured a blended learning approach, with in-person learning being recorded to support study and revision. Students' experience of TEL during the pandemic should be considered in the development and ongoing review of pharmacy programmes. © 2022 The Authors"
"Recent research has shown writing strategies to have a substantial impact on language learners' writing performance but little is known about what strategies EFL learners use and how they use them in writing academic texts such as reports, final assignments, and project papers. The study reported in this paper extends this line of research by investigating the strategies Vietnamese EFL pre-service teachers use in academic writing. Data included document analysis of 17 pre-service teachers' final assignment papers (one paper per teacher) and individual semi-structured interviews with ten teachers. The study adopted a content-based approach to qualitative data analysis with reference to a comprehensive research-based taxonomy for L2 academic writing strategies, including rhetorical, metacognitive, cognitive, and social affective strategies. The results show that rhetorical, metacognitive, and cognitive strategies were most frequently used by the teacher participants. The results further show that self-efficacy and self-regulation determined the teachers' use of strategies during the writing process. Implications for the L2 writing classroom focused on academic writing strategies to enhance pre-service teachers’ writing quality will be discussed. © 2023"
"The Cholera-Hospital-Based-Intervention-for-7-Days (CHoBI7) mobile health program promotes water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) behaviors through interactive voice response (IVR), voice, and text messages to reduce diarrheal diseases in Bangladesh. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between responses to CHoBI7 WASH IVR quiz messages and subsequent diarrhea and WASH behaviors. Fourteen CHoBI7 IVR quiz messages on handwashing with soap and treatment of stored water were sent to 517 households with 1,777 participants during the 12-month program period. IVR message responses were classified as correct answer, incorrect answer, no response (did not press 1 or 2), and failed (did not answer the phone). Diarrhea prevalence was assessed through self-reported monthly clinical surveillance visits. Handwashing with soap was assessed by a 5-hour structured observation, and stored water quality was defined by Escherichia coli concentration. Households that responded correctly to a CHoBI7 IVR quiz message had significantly lower odds of diarrhea for all age groups (adults and children) at the subsequent visit 1 month later (odds ratio [OR], 0.73; 95% CI, 0.54–0.98), and significantly greater odds of handwashing with soap after stool-related events (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.12–5.49) and E. coli levels, 100 colony forming units (CFU)/100 mL (World Health Organization high-risk cutoff) in the stored household water (OR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.25–3.33) compared with households that did not answer CHoBI7 IVR quiz calls. Correct responses to CHoBI7 IVR quizzes were associated with decreased diarrhea prevalence and improved stored drinking water quality and handwashing with soap behaviors at the subsequent visits. These findings suggest engagement in the CHoBI7 mobile health (mHealth) program and awareness of diarrheal disease prevention can reduce diarrhea and facilitate changes in WASH behaviors.

"Designing and delivering useful information for customers are crucial requirements of smart services as they influence the customer perception of the value and appeal of the service. Service information represents the results of data analysis that are delivered to customers. While the importance of transforming data into information has been recognized, the process of information design has been inadequately researched. This study introduces a methodology for transforming data into information to support smart services. The methodology is developed using morphological analysis and text mining. The proposed methodology was applied to a real-world case in smart services for vehicle operations management. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Fine-grained sentiment analysis, known as Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA), establishes the polarity of a section of text concerning a particular aspect. Aspect, sentiment, and emotion categorisation are the three steps that make up the configuration of ABSA, which we looked into for the dataset of English reviews. In this work, due to the fuzzy nature of textual data, we investigated machine learning methods based on fuzzy rough sets, which we believe are more interpretable than complex state-of-the-art models. The novelty of this paper is the use of a pipeline that incorporates all three mentioned steps and applies Fuzzy-Rough Nearest Neighbour classification techniques with their extension based on ordered weighted average operators (FRNN-OWA), combined with text embeddings based on transformers. After some improvements in the pipeline’s stages, such as using two separate models for emotion detection, we obtain the correct results for the majority of test instances (up to 81.4%) for all three classification tasks. We consider three different options for the pipeline. In two of them, all three classification tasks are performed consecutively, reducing data at each step to retain only correct predictions, while the third option performs each step independently. This solution allows us to examine the prediction results after each step and spot certain patterns. We used it for an error analysis that enables us, for each test instance, to identify the neighbouring training samples and demonstrate that our methods can extract useful patterns from the data. Finally, we compare our results with another paper that performed the same ABSA classification for the Dutch version of the dataset and conclude that our results are in line with theirs or even slightly better. © 2023 by the authors."
"After the cold war, some countries gradually seek to regional cooperation when they could not handle various transnational challenges alone. Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) is a good example. It brought Central Asian countries together. This paper applies the text-mining method, using co-word analysis, co-occurrence matrix, cluster analysis, and strategic diagram to analyze the selected articles from newspapers quantitatively and visually. In order to investigate the Chinese government’s attitude toward the SCO, this study collected data from the China Core Newspaper Full-text Database, which contains high-impact government newspapers revealing the Chinese government’s perception of the SCO. This study characterizes the changing role of SCO as perceived by the Chinese government from 2001 to 2019. Beijing’s changing expectations in each of the three identified subperiods are described.

"Objectives: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease in women of childbearing age. Although it is a leading cause of menstrual disorders, infertility, obesity, and other diseases, its molecular mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to analyze the target genes, pathways, and potential drugs for PCOS through text mining. Methods: First, three different keywords (""polycystic ovary syndrome"", ""obesity/adiposis"", and ""anovulation"") were uploaded to GenCLiP3 to obtain three different gene sets. We then chose the common genes among these gene sets. Second, we performed gene ontology and signal pathway enrichment analyses of these common genes, followed by protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis. Third, the most significant gene module clustered in the protein-protein network was selected to identify potential drugs for PCOS via gene-drug analysis. Results: A total of 4291 genes related to three different keywords were obtained through text mining, 72 common genes were filtered among the three gene sets, and 69 genes participated in PPI network construction, of which 23 genes were clustered in the gene modules. Finally, six of the 23 genes were targeted by 30 existing drugs. Conclusions: The discovery of the six genes (CYP19A1, ESR1, IGF1R, PGR, PTGS2, and VEGFA) and 30 targeted drugs, which are associated with ovarian steroidogenesis (P <0.001), may be used in potential therapeutic strategies for PCOS.

"The Editorial Office would like to draw the reader's attention to the error in the following article. Van Linden L, Stoops K, Dumbá LCCS et al. (2022). Sagittal crest morphology decoupled from relative bite performance in Pleistocene tapirs (Perissodactyla: Tapiridae). Integrative Zoology 00, 1–24. https://doi.org/10.1111/1749-4877.12627 In the original version of this Original Article, absolute bite forces were described for available species of tapirids (Tapiridae: Perissodactyla). Due to author oversights in the bite force calculations, the maximum tension constant for mammalian muscle (300 kPa; Law & Mehta 2019) was not incorporated into the calculation. In this correction, we present the amended text and accurate bite force estimates which account for maximum muscle tension alongside the original versions of both text and tables MATERIALS AND METHODS (paragraph 5, sentence 9) Original: Bilateral bite forces were estimated using the equation: (Formula presented.) where MP is the cross-sectional area for m. masseter + m. pterygoideus, mp is the moment arm for m. masseter + m. pterygoideus, T is the cross-sectional area for m. temporalis, t is the moment arm for m. temporalis, and Oi is the out-lever from the temporomandibular joint to each tooth. Correction: Bilateral bite forces were estimated using the equation: (Formula presented.) where MP is the cross-sectional area for m. masseter + m. pterygoideus, mp is the moment arm for m. masseter + m. pterygoideus, T is the cross-sectional area for m. temporalis, t is the moment arm for m. temporalis, and Oi is the out-lever from the temporomandibular joint to each tooth. Cross-sectional areas were multiplied by a maximum tension constant for mammalian muscle (300 kPa), following previous published works (e.g. Thomason 1991; Christiansen & Wroe 2007; Law & Mehta 2019). RESULTS (Table 2) Original and corrected bite forces (BF) at the first molar in Newtons (N) for tapirid species ± standard deviation (SD) to 3 significant figures, with n the number of specimens per species. (Table presented.) These corrected values were all subjected to the same correction (300 kPa maximum muscle tension; Law & Mehta 2019); as such, the values are altered but the resultant patterns of bite forces remain constant. No changes to the range of values compared to sagittal crest height were observed, and no changes to biogeographical variation are found. Thus, our interpretations regarding the influence of phylogeny and biogeography on the bite force data recovered are unaffected, and we do not present alternative graphs as the original patterns remain constant. A correction was added to Fig. 4 to display the correct bite forces. We have provided the updated bite force calculations as a Supplementary File. The corrected values for bite force do affect our interpretations for interspecific comparison in the Discussion section, so we provide the following amendments to the original text. 4 Figure (Figure presented.) DISCUSSION (paragraph 2, sentence 1) Original: Our study showed that tapirs exhibit variation in bite forces, with some species having higher bite forces relative to their skull size than might be expected (e.g. T. mesopotamicus). Unsurprisingly, tapirs with large skulls (and consequently large muscle masses) had high absolute bite forces. Bite force estimates for large herbivores are rare, particularly for extant ungulates (e.g. DeSantis et al. 2020; bite forces calculated but not reported), hence it is quite difficult to see how these tapir bite forces compare to other extant clades of large herbivores. However, bite force estimates have been calculated for large, extinct herbivores such as the diprotodontid marsupial Diprotodon optatum (Sharp & Rich 2016) and the hystricognath rodent Josephoartigasia monesi (Blanco et al. 2012). When compared to mid-sized tapirids in the present study (e.g. T. bairdii, T. veroensis; body masses ∼250 kg, MacLaren et al. 2018), the estimation of bilateral bite force at the center of the cheek toothrow for D. optatum yields similar bite forces (5000–6000 N) despite D. optatum reputedly reaching body masses of over 2000 kg (Wroe et al. 2004). Bilateral bite forces at the caniniform incisor for mid-sized tapirs (2000–2700 N) fall well within the range of bite forces for the giant rodent J. monesi (1260–6428 N; values from Blanco et al. (2012) scaled up to assume a bilateral bite force). Although these values for herbivores may appear high, especially for tapirs, herbivorous species of bears (Ursus malayanus and Ailuropoda melanoleuca) exhibit higher bite forces than carnivorous species (Christiansen & Wroe 2007); the overall pressure exerted on the apex of sharp, carnivoran teeth will ultimately be greater for a given input force than that of a ridged or lophodont tooth, as are exhibited in tapirs. Thus, the high values calculated for large-bodied herbivores, in general, may not be overly surprising. Correction: Our study showed that tapirs exhibit variation in bite forces, with some species having higher bite forces relative to their skull size than might be expected (e.g. T. mesopotamicus). Unsurprisingly, tapirs with large skulls (and consequently large muscle masses) had high absolute bite forces. Bite force estimates for large herbivores are rare, particularly for extant ungulates (e.g. DeSantis et al. 2020; bite forces calculated but not reported), hence it is quite difficult to see how these tapir bite forces compare to other extant clades of large herbivores. However, bite force estimates have been calculated for large, extinct herbivores such as the diprotodontid marsupial Diprotodon optatum (Sharp & Rich 2016) and the hystricognath rodent Josephoartigasia monesi (Blanco et al. 2012). When compared to the largest tapirids in the present study (T. augustus; BF ≈3200 N, body masses ∼630 kg, MacLaren et al. 2018), the estimation of bilateral bite force at the center of the cheek toothrow for D. optatum yields far higher absolute bite forces (5000–6000 N). Despite this, relative bite forces may have been more comparable, given that D. optatum reputedly reached body masses of over 2000 kg (Wroe et al. 2004), more than 3 times heavier than the largest tapir T. augustus. Bilateral bite forces at the caniniform incisor for T. augustus (∼1300 N) fall well within the range of bite forces for the giant rodent J. monesi (967–1850 N), an animal estimated to weigh up to 1000kg (Cox et al. 2015). Among herbivorous carnivorans with bite force data available, bite forces at the first molar for giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) approximate those of small-to-mid-sized Tapirus (1100–1800 N; Christiansen & Wroe 2007; Figueirido et al. 2014), never falling lower than the smallest extinct species (Tapirus polkensis ∼950 N). Although these values for herbivores may initially appear high, herbivorous species of bear (Ursus malayanus and Ailuropoda melanoleuca) on the whole exhibit higher bite forces than carnivorous species (Christiansen & Wroe 2007); the overall pressure exerted on the apex of sharp, carnivoran teeth will ultimately be greater for a given input force than that of a ridged or lophodont tooth, as are exhibited in tapirs. Thus, the high values calculated for large-bodied herbivores, in general, may not be overly surprising. All other discussion topics and conclusions remain accurate in the original version of the manuscript. In the Supplementary Information, an amended raw dataset has been provided including edited units, raw values and species averaged values for bite force and sagittal crest height.

"Extreme climate events and renewable energy development challenge the reliability of the power supply, which is an important guarantee for high-quality economic development and the production and operation of firms. In this paper, we analyzed the relationship between power shortage and firm productivity by developing a city-level power shortage index in China using the text analysis method. The results indicate that power shortage reduces the probability, quantity, and quality of R&D investment and has a negative impact on the total factor productivity (TFP) of firms. However, it has a smaller negative impact on the TFP of large- and medium-sized firms, export-oriented firms, and state-owned firms than others. Our results are robust to alternative measures of power shortage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize research by automating data analysis, generating new insights, and supporting the discovery of new knowledge. The top 10 contribution areas of AI towards public health were gathered in this exploratory study. We utilized the “text-davinci-003” model of GPT-3, using OpenAI playground default parameters. The model was trained with the largest training dataset any AI had, limited to a cut-off date in 2021. This study aimed to test the ability of GPT-3 to advance public health and to explore the feasibility of using AI as a scientific co-author. We asked the AI asked for structured input, including scientific quotations, and reviewed responses for plausibility. We found that GPT-3 was able to assemble, summarize, and generate plausible text blocks relevant for public health concerns, elucidating valuable areas of application for itself. However, most quotations were purely invented by GPT-3 and thus invalid. Our research showed that AI can contribute to public health research as a team member. According to authorship guidelines, the AI was ultimately not listed as a co-author, as it would be done with a human researcher. We conclude that good scientific practice also needs to be followed for AI contributions, and a broad scientific discourse on AI contributions is needed. © 2023 by the authors."
"Purpose: This study was to analyze the responses of informants about Instagram infographics on Covid-19 prevention for pregnant women. Methods: This was a qualitative study that used Rapid Assessment Procedure (RAP) and used pretesting communication theory. The informant selection technique was purposive sampling that consist of three pregnant women as main informants, a midwifery lecturer and a visual graphic designer as key informants. One-to-one pretesting communication procedure was selected because the research was conducted at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, so it had a difficulty in recruiting informants. The interview guideline was conducted by the research team and was examined in a field trial. Data collection was by semi-structured interview using voice call WhatsApp application. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: In attraction aspect, this was considered quite interesting by the informants. In comprehension aspect, the messages were easily understood because of using brief, concise, and simple sentences. Furthermore, the messages were supported by images and comprehensive. In acceptance aspect, all the informants’ opinions were identified that the messages of this infographic did not have a conflict with the existing norms. In self-involvement aspect, this infographic was in accordance with the current condition of the informants. In persuasion aspect, it had a good persuasive value as the informants were willing to share the infographic with others. Conclusion: The infographic still needed improvements from the attraction aspect such as consider using contrasting colour between the background and text, equalize the font size and change icons to become related to the text. As from the comprehension aspect consider using terms that are more popular in the community. There were no need improvements from acceptance, self-involvement, and persuasion aspects. However, evidence-based research is still needed on how this infographic is developed and implemented to optimize transfer of knowledge. © 2023, Dove Medical Press Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Research question: Does dental trauma have impact on the oral health-related quality of life of children and adolescents? Research protocol: Protocol was designed as per the best practices of evidence-based medicine, guidelines for umbrella reviews and registered in PROSPERO. Literature search: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Sciences and Lilacs were searched for studies meeting the inclusion criteria from start of databases to 15th July 2021. Grey literature and registries of systematic review protocols were also searched. Hand searching of the references of included articles was also performed. The literature search was updated on 15th October 2021. Scrutiny of the titles and abstracts and later full text was done as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction: Self-designed pre-piloted form was used by two reviewers. Quality appraisal: AMSTAR-2 was used to assess the quality of systematic reviews, PRISMA was used to check reporting-characteristics and citation-matrix was used to evaluate study-overlap. Quality of evidence was assessed by using Kohler’s-criteria. Data analysis: Qualitative synthesis was performed for describing the study characteristics, details of sampling and the tool of OHRQoL used. The meta-analytic data was used for evaluating the evidence and its strength for each of the outcomes. Results and interpretation: A significant impact of all types of TDI on OHRQoL in children and adolescents was observed. The effect of uncomplicated TDI on OHRQoL in children and all ages showed no difference from controls. Though the quality of evidence in these interpretations was weak. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to British Dental Association."
"Background: With an increasing older population, the pressure on home care resources is growing, which makes it important to ensure the maintenance of quality care. It is known that compassion and ethical sensitivity can improve the quality of care, but little is known about care leaders’ perceptions on ethical sensitivity and compassion in home care and how it is associated with staff competence and thus quality of care. Aim: The aim of the study was to explore home care leaders’ perceptions of ethical sensitivity and compassion associated with care quality in home care. Research design, participants, and research context: A hermeneutical approach with a qualitative explorative design was used. The data consists of texts from 10 in-depth interviews with home care leaders. Content analysis was used as a method. Ethical considerations: The study was conducted following the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Finnish Advisory Board of Research Ethics. Research ethics permission was applied for from a Research Ethics Board. Findings: One overall theme and four subthemes were found. The overall theme was: “Compassion provides deeper meaning and ethical sensitivity provides means for knowing how to act”. Discussion: If nurses fail to be sensitive and compassionate with patients, good and high qualitative home care cannot be achieved. Ethical sensitivity and compassion can be seen as resources in home care but the organization and the care leaders need to provide the support for these to develop. Conclusion: This study provides an understanding of the meaning of ethical sensitivity and compassion as sources of strength and their link to quality of care in a home care context. Further studies could focus on how to build compassion and ethical sensitivity into home-based care and how to ensure adequate support for healthcare professionals’ compassion and ethical sensitivity. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Based on the background of the digital transformation of commercial banks, the advantages and benefits of this study are to study the promotion effect of digital finance on the production efficiency of commercial banks from four aspects: technological innovation, financial innovation, deep integration of technology and finance, and industry advantages. This study verifies that digital finance has a positive impact on the total factor productivity of commercial banks. In order to study the impact of the development of digital finance on the efficiency of commercial banks, this paper puts forward two assumptions. Using the “text mining method” and taking the total factor productivity of commercial banks as the explanatory variable and the digital finance index as the core explanatory variable, this paper empirically studies the impact of digital finance on bank efficiency. Through empirical research, it is believed that through the analysis of total factor productivity, digital finance has strongly promoted the improvement of the total factor productivity of commercial banks through the technology spillover effect. The impact of digital finance on banks is therefore heterogeneous. © 2023 by the authors."
"The improvement of health literacy (HL) is a critical issue for college students who are in the transitional period to adulthood and are establishing their subsequent lifestyles. The present study aimed to evaluate the current state of HL among college students and to explore the factors that influence HL. Moreover, it investigated the relationship between HL and health conditions. For this study, the researchers conducted an online survey of college students. The questionnaire consisted of the Japanese version of the 47-item European Health Literacy Survey Questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q47), which is a self-assessment tool for HL that covers the major health issues of college students and health-related quality of life. The study analyzed 1049 valid responses. Based on the HLS-EU-Q47 total score, 85% of the participants exhibited problematic or unsatisfactory HL levels. Participants who reported high levels of healthy lifestyles obtained high HL scores. High levels of HL were associated with high levels of subjective health. Results from quantitative text analysis suggested that specific mindsets were correlated with high levels of competency in appraising health information among male students. In the future, educational intervention programs for college students need to be established to improve HL levels. © 2023 by the authors."
"Problem: This tutorial aims to guide readers through key concepts, basic processes, and common decision points that inform computer-assisted corpus-based research in technical, professional, and scientific communication (TPSC). Key concepts: Based on our collaborative experiences and an example developed for this tutorial, key concepts of corpus analysis useful to TPSC researchers and practitioners include the following: corpus location, text preparation, and programming language and software selection. Key lessons: These key concepts can be used to establish basic processes and decision points that, in turn, yield lessons related to the usefulness of lexicogrammatical language models and the significance of multidisciplinarity. Implications: Although corpus research is a growing and important part of the field of TPSC, challenges remain in terms of language model variety and ethical considerations. At least in part, these challenges can be met, respectively, by alignment between corpus and analytic tools and reference to the Common Rule and related international standards.  © 1988-2012 IEEE."
"Aim: To document current teaching methods, curriculum, and perceived educational preparation related to the teaching of life-limiting fetal conditions, termination, and perinatal palliative care to Australian student midwives. Background: Australian women receiving a diagnosis of a life-limiting fetal condition are generally offered a choice between termination of pregnancy and perinatal palliative care. Midwives are often involved with caring for these women. What Australian student midwives are being taught about life-limiting fetal conditions, termination of pregnancy, and perinatal palliative care during their entry-to-practice program is unknown. Design: This study utilised a mixed-methods descriptive approach for data collection and analysis. Methods: Academic Leads of all Australian entry-to-practice midwifery programs received a questionnaire exploring topics taught, teaching time, teacher role, and perceived effectiveness of student preparation. Data was analysed statistically and thematically. Results: Twelve of 24 Academic Leads responded (50%); only five stated their programs taught all three areas. More respondents taught about termination of pregnancy (10/12) than perinatal palliative care (7/12). On average 5.8 ( ± 2.8) total hours was spent teaching about life-limiting fetal conditions, termination of pregnancy, and perinatal palliative care during the entire midwifery program, with a range of 1 – 10 h. The free-text data identified three central themes: lack of value within the curriculum; disconnect between the university and the placement hospital; and preparation for practice. Most (10/12) Academic Leads did not believe student midwives are prepared to care for affected families. Conclusions: Entry-to-practice midwifery programs vary considerably in their education surrounding life-limiting fetal conditions, however teaching hours overall were low and most Academic leads did not feel (or know if) their students were adequately prepared. Further research is required to determine if early career midwives find their university education in life-limiting fetal conditions adequate preparation for practice, and to then remediate identified deficiencies. © 2023 The Authors"
"With the increasing importance of computer intelligence in the new round of the industrial revolution, administrative, regulatory, or design (ARD) green technology contributes to improving national technological competitiveness and promoting the transformation of green technology, which is becoming an important field under sustainable development goals. The U.S. and China ranked top two in terms of paper influence and patent applications in the field of ARD green technology. However, few comparative studies have been conducted in these two countries. This study presents the evolution and landscapes of ARD green technology between China and the U.S., focusing on comparing development priorities and technical layouts in each five-year plan period. According to the “International Patent Classification (IPC) Green Inventory” launched by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), we retrieved 69,412 patents published between 2001 and 2020 from the PatSnap database. Descriptive, content, and thematic network analyses were conducted using latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) and community detection algorithms. The results show that both China and the U.S. strategically focus on ARD green technology development. The technical topics in this field can be divided into three themes: data processing systems, traffic control systems, and building designs. The emphasis on technology research and development (R&D) differs between China and the U.S. There is also evidence that the U.S. has advantages in terms of technological innovation and capabilities. However, China has an advantage in terms of data volume, and the gap between China and the U.S. is gradually narrowing. We also highlight the contributions and limitations of this study. © 2023 Xi'an Jiaotong University"
"Microimplant-assisted rapid palatal expansion is increasingly used clinically; however, the effect on the upper airway volume in patients with maxillary transverse deficiency has not been thoroughly evaluated yet. The following electronic databases were searched up to August 2022: Medline via Ovid, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, and ProQuest. The reference lists of related articles were also reviewed by manual search. The Revised Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized trials (ROB2) and the Risk of Bias in non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool were used to evaluate the risks of bias of the included studies. The mean differences (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of changes in nasal cavity and upper airway volume were analyzed using a random-effects model, and subgroup and sensitivity analyses were also performed. Two reviewers independently completed the process of screening studies, extracting data, and assessing the quality of studies. In total, twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria. After assessing the full texts, only thirteen studies were included, with nine studies selected for quantitative synthesis. Oropharynx volume increased significantly after immediate expansion (WMD: 3156.84; 95% CI: 83.63, 6230.06); however, there was no significant change in nasal volume (WMD: 2527.23; 95% CI: −92.53, 5147.00) and nasopharynx volume (WMD: 1138.29; 95% CI: −52.04, 2328.61). After retention a period, significant increases were found in nasal volume (WMD: 3646.27; 95% CI: 1082.77, 6209.77) and nasopharynx volume (WMD: 1021.10; 95% CI: 597.11, 1445.08). However, there was no significant change after retention in oropharynx volume (WMD: 789.26; 95% CI: −171.25, 1749.76), palatopharynx volume (WMD: 795.13; 95% CI: −583.97, 2174.22), glossopharynx volume (WMD: 184.50; 95% CI: −1745.97, 2114.96), and hypopharynx volume (WMD: 39.85; 95% CI: −809.77, 889.46). MARPE appears to be linked with long-term increases in nasal and nasopharyngeal volume. However, high-quality clinical trials are required to further verify the effects of MARPE treatment on the upper airway. © 2023 by the authors."
"This study aimed to assess global trends in research on salt stress in rice and provide new directions for future studies. The subjects in this study are a plain text file with full records and cited references (Web of Science core collection as the database, “rice” and “salt” as the retrieved title with the date range from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2021). The bibliometric method was used in this study, and the results were visualized using Scimago Graphica, VOSviewer, and CiteSpace. The results showed that China, India, and Japan contributed most of the literature in this field, and the institutes with the largest academic output were the Chinese Academy of Science, the International Rice Research Institute, and Nanjing Agriculture University. This study argues that research on salt stress in rice has been conducted in three main areas: phenotypes, response mechanisms, and remediation strategies. Inoculation of rhizosphere bacteria, ion homeostasis, soil remediation, and gene editing will be popular topics in rice salt stress research in the future. This study aimed to provide a potential theoretical direction for research on salt stress in rice as well as a reference for feasible studies on the exploitation of saline–alkali lands. © 2023 by the authors."
"OBJECTIVE: Reduced fetal movement, defined as a decrease in the frequency or strength of fetal movements as perceived by the mother, is a common reason for presentation to maternity care. Observational studies have demonstrated an association between reduced fetal movement and stillbirth and fetal growth restriction related to placental insufficiency. However, individual intervention studies have described varying results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine whether interventions aimed at encouraging awareness of reduced fetal movement and/or improving its subsequent clinical management reduce the frequency of stillbirth or other important secondary outcomes. DATA SOURCES: Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar. Guidelines, trial registries, and gray literature were also searched. Databases were searched from inception to January 20, 2022. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials and controlled nonrandomized studies were eligible if they assessed interventions aimed at encouraging awareness of fetal movement or fetal movement counting and/or improving the subsequent clinical management of reduced fetal movement. Eligible populations were singleton pregnancies after 24 completed weeks of gestation. The primary review outcome was stillbirth; a number of secondary maternal and neonatal outcomes were specified in the review. METHODS: Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 and Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies I tools for randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies, respectively. Variation caused by heterogeneity was assessed using I2. Data from studies employing similar interventions were combined using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1609 citations were identified; 190 full-text articles were evaluated against the inclusion criteria, 18 studies (16 randomized controlled trials and 2 nonrandomized studies) were included. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of encouraging awareness of fetal movement on stillbirth when compared with standard care (2 studies, n=330,084) with a pooled adjusted odds ratio of 1.19 (95% confidence interval, 0.96–1.47). Interventions for encouraging awareness of fetal movement may be associated with a reduction in neonatal intensive care unit admissions and Apgar scores of <7 at 5 minutes of age and may not be associated with increases in cesarean deliveries or induction of labor. The evidence is uncertain about the effect of encouraging fetal movement counting on stillbirth when compared with standard care with a pooled odds ratio of 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.18–2.65) based on data from 3 randomized controlled trials (n=70,584). Counting fetal movements may increase maternal-fetal attachment and decrease anxiety when compared with standard care. When comparing combined interventions of fetal movement awareness and subsequent clinical management with standard care (1 study, n=393,857), the evidence is uncertain about the effect on stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.70–1.05). CONCLUSION: The effect of interventions for encouraging awareness of reduced fetal movement alone or in combination with subsequent clinical management on stillbirth is uncertain. Encouraging awareness of fetal movement may be associated with reduced adverse neonatal outcomes without an increase in interventions in labor. The meta-analysis was hampered by variations in interventions, outcome reporting, and definitions. Individual studies are frequently underpowered to detect a reduction in severe, rare outcomes and no studies were included from high-burden settings. Studies from such settings are needed to determine whether interventions can reduce stillbirth. © 2022 The Authors"
"Background: Choroid plexus (CP) metastases are an extremely rare condition accounting for less than 1% of brain metastases. Due to its scarcity, little is known about this pathology and its management. Herein, we propose a review of the current literature to help its diagnosis and management. Methods: Through a literature review based on PubMed/MEDLINE database, we reviewed 94 cases of intraventricular metastasis of solid cancer in 28 full-text articles in English from 1980 to 2010. We have reported epidemiological, clinical, radiological, histological data, as well as management strategies and outcomes. A case report of fourth ventricular pulmonary metastasis illustrates this review. Results: Intraventricular metastases are most often reported in patients in their 6th decade. The clinical presentation is marked by acute hydrocephalus, more rarely lesional bleeding. Three-quarters of intraventricular metastases develop in lateral ventricle, then respectively in the fourth and third ventricles. Kidney cancer accounts for 45% of the cases. The treatment modalities are surgical removal in case of a single lesion and adjuvant radiotherapy and chemotherapy depending on the primary cancer. The prognosis remains poor due to dissemination via the cerebrospinal fluid. Conclusion: Multiple choroid plexus metastasis is a rare diagnosis, affecting patients with a specific clinical presentation and a misleading radiological appearance. There is no standard of care for the management of these lesions and surgical approach can be challenging. © 2023"
"As sustainability becomes fundamental to companies, voluntary and mandatory disclosures or corporate sustainability practices have become a key source of information for various stakeholders, including regulatory bodies, environmental watchdogs, nonprofits and NGOs, investors, shareholders, and the public at large. Understanding sustainability practices by analyzing a large volume of disclosures poses major challenges, given that the information is mostly in the form of text. Applying machine learning and text analytic methods, we analyzed approximately 25,428 disclosure reports for the period of 2011 to 2020, extracted from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and made available at the Ceres website via application programming interfaces (APIs). Our study identified six industry clusters from the K-means and six main topics from the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) method that related to the disclosure of climate-change-related environmental concerns. Both methods produced overlapping results that further reinforce and enhance our understanding of climate-change-related disclosure at various levels, such as sector, industry, and topic. Our analysis shows that companies are concerned primarily with the topics of gas emission, carbon risk, climate change, loss and damage, renewable energy, and financial impact when disclosing climate-change-related issues to the government. The study has implications for corporate sustainability practices, the communication and dissemination of such practices to stakeholders at large and furthering our understanding of sustainability in general. © 2023 by the authors."
"Purpose: Implantable electronic cardiovascular device such as cardiac pacemakers and implantable defibrillators are common life-saving devices. Device-related complications can arise when undergoing surgical interventions with electrosurgical tools due to electromagnetic interference, based on electrocautery type, implantable electronic cardiovascular device type, electrocautery location, and a number of other factors. The risk of device-related complications due to electrocautery in oculoplastic surgery has not been established. This systematic literature review assesses prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of electrocautery-related device complications in oculoplastic surgery. Methods: Systematic literature review followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic and Meta-Analysis guidelines and used the search terms ""pacemaker,"" ""implantable cardioverter defibrillator,"" ""electrocautery,"" ""cautery,"" and ""electrosurgery"" through June 2022. Inclusion criteria were full-text articles, discussing ocular, oculoplastic, or other facial surgery. Exclusion criteria were non-English language or surgery focused on other parts of the body. Full-text manuscripts of identified articles were reviewed and relevant data were extracted. Results: Twelve studies met inclusion criteria. Two studies were level I and II evidence, while 10 studies were level III or IV. There were no reports of electromagnetic interference with bipolar cautery use. With monopolar cautery use, cases of electromagnetic interference were reported, but without related significant morbidity or mortality. Safety recommendations to minimize electrical flow through the implantable electronic cardiovascular device are described. Conclusions: There were no reports of implantable electronic cardiovascular device-related complications from bipolar or thermocautery use in ophthalmic or oculoplastic surgeries. Monopolar have been associated with electromagnetic interference, but additional preoperative and perioperative measures can be taken to mitigate this risk. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Data sources: Cochrane Oral Health Information specialist searched databases: Cochrane Oral Health’s Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane diary, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase Ovid, CINAHL EBSCO and Open Grey up to 17 November 2021 without language, publication status or year restriction. Additionally, Chinese Bio Medical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure and VIP database were searched up to 4 March 2022. For ongoing trials, the US National Institutes of Health Trials Register, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Registry Platform (up to 17 November 2021), and Sciencepaper Online (up to 4 March 2022) were also searched. A reference list of included studies, hand searching for important journals, and Chinese professional journals in the relevant field was performed until March 2022. Study selection: Authors screened the articles on the basis of their titles and abstracts. Duplicates were removed. Full-text publications were evaluated. Any disagreement was resolved by discussion amongst themselves or in consultation with a third reviewer. Only randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of periodontal treatment on participants having chronic periodontitis with cardiovascular disease (CVD) (secondary prevention) or without cardiovascular disease (primary prevention) with minimum follow-up of one year were considered. Patients having known genetic or congenital heart defects, other sources of inflammation, aggressive periodontitis, or were pregnant and/or lactating were excluded. Subgingival scaling and root planning (SRP) with or without combination of systemic antibiotics with or without active remedies were compared with supragingival scaling, mouth rinse, or no periodontal treatment. Data extraction and synthesis: Data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers in duplicate. A formal, customised pilot-based data extraction form was used to capture data. Overall risk of bias for each study was categorised as low, medium, and high. For trials having missing data or unclear data, clarification from the authors were sought by mail. Testing for heterogeneity was planned by I2 test. For dichotomous data, fixed-effect model (Mantel-Haenszel) was used; and for continuous data, mean difference and 95% confidence intervals were used as measures of treatment effect. For time-to-event data, Peto or inverse variance method was used. Sensitivity and subgroup analysis was planned to test the stability of conclusion. Results: Following initial electronic and hand search, 1690 articles were screened for title and abstract and 82 articles were considered for full-text eligibility. Finally, two studies out of the reported six articles were included in this review for qualitative synthesis of results, and no study was included in the quantitative analysis. Publication bias was determined using funnel plots which were further assessed using dichotomous and continuous outcome. For primary prevention of CVD in participants with periodontitis and metabolic syndrome, one study (165 participants) provided very low certainty evidence. Scaling and root planning plus amoxicillin and metronidazole could reduce incidence of all-cause death (Peto odds ratio [OR] 7.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15 to 376.98), or all CVD-related death (Peto OR 7.48, 95% CI 0.15 to 376.98). The possibility that scaling and root planning plus amoxicillin and metronidazole could increase cardiovascular events (Peto OR 7.77, 95% CI 1.07 to 56.1) compared with supragingival scaling measured at 12-month follow-up was observed. For secondary prevention of CVD, one pilot study randomised 303 participants to receive scaling and root planning plus oral hygiene instruction or oral hygiene instruction plus a copy of radiographs and recommendation to follow-up with a dentist (community care). As cardiovascular events had been measured for different time periods between 6 and 25 months, and only 37 participants were available with at least one-year follow-up, the data was not sufficiently robust for inclusion in the review. The study did not evaluate all-cause death and all CVD-related death. Conclusions about the effects of periodontal therapy on secondary prevention of CVD were not drawn. Conclusions: There is very limited evidence assessing the impact of periodontal therapy on the prevention of cardiovascular disease, and it is insufficient to generate any implications for practice. Further trials are needed before reliable conclusions can be drawn. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to British Dental Association."
"Determining gender using offline handwriting is an applied research problem in forensics, psychology and security applications. This task becomes challenging and tedious due to interpersonal and intrapersonal differences in handwriting. This work proposes gender classification from offline handwritten text using a machine learning model, trained on features from the proposed novel dataset, extracted using two Novel Local Binary Pattern-based feature extraction approaches, ALBP (AND Local Binary Pattern) and OLBP (OR Local Binary Pattern). The proposed novel features extend the LBP feature to include the details from 24 neighbouring pixels around the centre pixel. These two features utilize logical operations for distinguishing the two-level neighbouring pixel hierarchy, from the centre pixel, based on their intensity within the specified threshold. The proposed approach, assessed with scientific rigour, extracts the complete and helpful information around a centre pixel. Various techniques, including principal component analysis, cross-validation and holdout validation, are tested to generalize the model better. As a result, Both methods, ALBP and OLBP, show better results, outperform LBP, and achieve the best accuracy of 99% with 15-fold cross-validation for predicting gender from the offline handwritten text. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management."
"PURPOSE: To explore the effect of silicone dressings on the prevention of pressure injuries in patients cared for in the acute care setting. Three main comparisons were explored: silicone dressing versus no dressing, all anatomical areas; silicone dressing versus no dressing on the sacrum; and silicone dressing versus no dressing on the heels. METHODS: Using a systematic review methodology, published randomized controlled trials and cluster randomized controlled trials were included. The search was conducted from December 2020 to January 2021 using CINAHL, full text on EBSCOhost, MEDLINE on EBSCOhost, and Cochrane databases. The search returned 130 studies; 10 met inclusion criteria. Data were extracted using a predesigned extraction tool. The Cochrane Collaboration tool was used to assess the risk of bias and the certainty of the evidence was appraised using a software program specifically designed for this purpose. RESULTS: Silicone dressings probably reduce the incidence of pressure injuries compared to no dressings (relative risk [RR]: 0.40, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.31-0.53; moderate certainty evidence). Furthermore, silicone dressings probably reduce the incidence of pressure injuries on the sacrum compared to no dressings (RR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.31-0.62; moderate certainty evidence). Finally, silicone dressings probably reduce the incidence of pressure injuries on the heels compared to no dressings (RR: 0.44, 95% CI: 0.31-0.62; moderate certainty evidence). CONCLUSION: There is moderate certainty evidence of the effect of silicone dressings as a component of a pressure injury prevention strategy. The main limiting factor in the study designs was a high risk of performance and detection bias. Although this is a challenge to achieve in trials such as these, consideration should be given to how the effect of this could be minimized. A further issue is the lack of head-to-head trials that limits clinicians' abilities to determine whether any of the products in this category are more effective than others. © 2023 Authors.

"Importance The associations between endogenous dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS), and depression in older women are uncertain. However, DHEA supplements are widely available over the counter in some countries, and some people may be taking DHEA with the hope of positive mood effects. Objective This systematic review aimed to investigate the association between endogenous DHEA/DHEAS blood concentrations and depression/depressive symptoms in community-dwelling postmenopausal women. Evidence Review: Searches were conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases for observational studies with at least 100 community-dwelling participants until March 9, 2022. The bibliographies of retrieved articles were manually searched. The studies published in English and meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the review. The risk of bias was assessed with the modified Hoy tool for cross-sectional designs and the Joanna Briggs Institute modified critical appraisal checklist for cohort studies. Findings Of the 30 articles retrieved for full-text review, 14 met the criteria for inclusion. Seven studies were cross-sectional, six were longitudinal, and one had both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Five of eight cross-sectional studies found no association between DHEAS and depression, whereas three studies reported an inverse association. Similarly, most of the studies (n = 4) with longitudinal data reported no association, whereas two studies reported either an inverse association or mixed results for DHEAS and depression severity. No association between DHEA and depression was found irrespective of the study design. Heterogeneity of design was a barrier to meta-analysis and between study comparison. The majority of studies were limited by high risk of bias in at least one assessed domain. Conclusion and Relevance This systematic review does not support an association between endogenous DHEA/DHEAS and depression in postmenopausal women.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"BACKGROUND: Increasing childhood cancer survival rates in recent decades have led to an increased focus on fertility as a long-term complication of cancer treatment. Male childhood cancer survivors often face compromised testicular function as a late effect of chemotherapy exposure, with no well-established options to prevent such damage and subsequent infertility. Despite vincristine being considered to be associated with low-gonadotoxic potential, in prepubertal rodents, it was recently shown to result in morphological alterations of the testis and in severely impaired fertility. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effects of vincristine-containing regimens on human prepubertal testis with reference to testicular function and fertility in adulthood. SEARCH METHODS: The systematic search of the literature was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, and the study was registered with PROSPERO. PubMed and Scopus were searched for articles published in English between 01 January 1900 and 05 March 2021, with the search including chemotherapy, vincristine, prepubertal, testis, spermatogenesis and related terms. Abstracts and full-text articles were screened and selected for, providing they met the inclusion criteria (12 years at treatment, exposure to vincristinecontaining regimens and long-term fertility outcomes). Additional studies were identified via bibliography screening. Bias evaluation across included studies was conducted using the ROBINS-I tool, subdivided into assessment for confounding, participant selection, intervention classification, missing data, outcome measurements and selection of reported results. OUTCOMES: Our initial search identified 288 articles of which 24 (8%; n 7134 males) met all inclusion criteria. Control groups were included for 9/24 (38%) studies and 4/24 (17%) studies provided sub-analysis of the relative gonadotoxicity of vincristine-based agents. Primary outcome measures were: fertility and parenthood; semen analysis (World Health Organization criteria); and hormonal function and testicular volume. For the studies that performed vincristine sub-analysis, none reported negative associations with vincristine for the potential of siring a pregnancy, including the largest (n 6224; hazard ratio 0.56) controlled study. For semen analysis, no significant difference versus healthy controls was illustrated for mitotic inhibitors (including vincristine) following sub-analysis in one study (n 143). For hormone analysis, a single study did not find significant impacts on spermatogenesis attributed to vincristine based on levels of FSH and semen analysis, which meant that its administration was unlikely to be responsible for the diminished testicular reserve; however, most of the studies were based on low numbers of patients receiving vincristine-containing chemotherapy. Analysis of bias demonstrated that studies which included vincristine exposure sub-analysis had a lower risk of bias when compared with cohorts which did not. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: In contrast to recent findings in rodent studies, the limited number of clinical studies do not indicate gonadotoxic effects of vincristine following prepubertal exposure. However, given the relative lack of data from studies with vincristine subanalysis, experimental studies involving vincristine exposure using human testicular tissues are warranted. Results from such studies could better inform paediatric cancer patients about their future fertility and eligibility for fertility preservation before initiation of treatment. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

"The burnout rate among physicians is expected to be higher during COVID-19 period due to the additional sources of physical and emotional stressors. Throughout the current COVID-19 pandemic, numerous studies have evaluated the impacts of COVID-19 on physicians’ burnout, but the reported results have been inconsistent. This current systematic review and meta-analysis aims to assess and estimate the epidemiology of burnout and the associated risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic among physicians. A systematic search for studies targeting physicians’ burnout was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, Cochrane COVID-19 registry, and pre-print services (PsyArXiv and medRχiv) for English language studies published within the time period of 1 January 2020 to 1 September 2021. Search strategies resulted in 446 possible eligible studies. The titles and abstracts of these studies were screened, which resulted in 34 probable studies for inclusion, while 412 studies were excluded based on the predetermined inclusion criteria. These 34 studies went through a full-text screening for eligibility, which resulted in 30 studies being included in the final reviews and subsequent analyses. Among them, the prevalence of physicians’ burnout rate ranged from 6.0–99.8%. This wide variation could be due to the heterogeneity among burnout definitions, different applied assessment tools, and even cultural factors. Further studies may consider other factors when assessing burnout (e.g., the presence of a psychiatric disorders, other work-related and cultural factors). In conclusion, a consistent diagnostic indices for the assessment of burnout is required to enable consistent methods of scoring and interpretation. © 2023 by the authors."
"Road safety is increasingly threatened by distracted driving. Studies have shown that there is a significantly increased risk for a driver of being involved in a car crash due to visual distractions (not watching the road), manual distractions (hands are off the wheel for other non-driving activities), and cognitive and acoustic distractions (the driver is not focused on the driving task). Driving simulators (DSs) are powerful tools for identifying drivers’ responses to different distracting factors in a safe manner. This paper aims to systematically review simulator-based studies to investigate what types of distractions are introduced when using the phone for texting while driving (TWD), what hardware and measures are used to analyze distraction, and what the impact of using mobile devices to read and write messages while driving is on driving performance. The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. A total of 7151 studies were identified in the database search, of which 67 were included in the review, and they were analyzed in order to respond to four research questions. The main findings revealed that TWD distraction has negative effects on driving performance, affecting drivers’ divided attention and concentration, which can lead to potentially life-threatening traffic events. We also provide several recommendations for driving simulators that can ensure high reliability and validity for experiments. This review can serve as a basis for regulators and interested parties to propose restrictions related to using mobile phones in a vehicle and improve road safety. © 2023 by the authors."
"Clinical trials frequently include multiple end points that mature at different times. The initial report, typically based on the primary end point, may be published when key planned co-primary or secondary analyses are not yet available. Clinical Trial Updates provide an opportunity to disseminate additional results from studies, published in JCO or elsewhere, for which the primary end point has already been reported.The combined analysis of SOFT-TEXT compared outcomes in 4,690 premenopausal women with estrogen/progesterone receptor-positive (ER/PgR+) early breast cancer randomly assigned to 5 years of exemestane + ovarian function suppression (OFS) versus tamoxifen + OFS. After a median follow-up of 9 years, exemestane + OFS significantly improved disease-free survival (DFS) and distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI), but not overall survival, compared with tamoxifen + OFS. We now report DFS, DRFI, and overall survival after a median follow-up of 13 years. In the intention-to-treat (ITT) population, the 12-year DFS (4.6% absolute improvement, hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.90; P <.001) and DRFI (1.8% absolute improvement, HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.98; P =.03), but not overall survival (90.1% v 89.1%, HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.78 to 1.11), continued to be significantly improved for patients assigned exemestane + OFS over tamoxifen + OFS. Among patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative tumors (86.0% of the ITT population), the absolute improvement in 12-year overall survival with exemestane + OFS was 2.0% (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.70 to 1.04) and 3.3% in those who received chemotherapy (45.9% of the ITT population). Overall survival benefit was clinically significant in high-risk patients, eg, women age < 35 years (4.0%) and those with > 2 cm (4.5%) or grade 3 tumors (5.5%).

"The emotion analysis of hotel online reviews is discussed by using the neural network model BERT, which proves that this method can not only help hotel network platforms fully understand customer needs but also help customers find suitable hotels according to their needs and affordability and help hotel recommendations be more intelligent. Therefore, using the pretraining BERT model, a number of emotion analytical experiments were carried out through fine-tuning, and a model with high classification accuracy was obtained by frequently adjusting the parameters during the experiment. The BERT layer was taken as a word vector layer, and the input text sequence was used as the input to the BERT layer for vector transformation. The output vectors of BERT passed through the corresponding neural network and were then classified by the softmax activation function. ERNIE is an enhancement of the BERT layer. Both models can lead to good classification results, but the latter performs better. ERNIE exhibits stronger classification and stability than BERT, which provides a promising research direction for the field of tourism and hotels. Copyright: © 2023 Wen et al.

"This paper looks at the translation of address terms from the perspective of the pragmatics of fiction and interpersonal pragmatics. It aims to offer some insights into how choices made by translators in this respect affect the presentation of relationships among fictional characters. The analysis focuses on the address terms used between the main characters of Henning Mankell's novel The Dogs of Riga, Kurt Wallander and Baiba Liepa, in the original Swedish version and in its English and Polish translations. The study examines how the relational work done by the characters in the source text (selection of address terms, address terms negotiations, shifts in address use) is recreated in the two translations. The identified dissimilarities are shown to result both from the differences between Swedish, English and Polish address systems, particularly concerning ways of expressing the T-V semantics, and from the translators' interpretation of the relational work done by the characters in the source text. Misinterpretations result in the use of unnatural and contextually inappropriate address forms, which disrupt the interactional coherence of the novel and are inconsistent with the characters' non-verbal behaviour. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."
"What are the features of high-quality online courses in higher education? In this scoping review, we explore peer-reviewed scholarship related to the features of online learning in postsecondary contexts. We searched ERIC (EBSCO), Education Research Complete, and SocINDEX with Fulltext to retrieve peer-reviewed literature from 2010-2022 pertaining to features of online learning in higher education. Two reviewers independently conducted the initial title and abstract screening (n = 1,574), full text review (n = 483), and data extraction of the included articles (n = 38). Using thematic content analysis to explore the data extracted from each article, we found that the literature predominately included scholarship related to quality online course design, instructor facilitation in online courses, quality assessment of online courses, and student engagement in online courses. The breadth of these themes included a multiplicity of strategies and approaches to consider when designing online learning experiences. We recommend that administrators, faculty members, and instructors responsible for designing online courses and programs for postsecondary contexts continue to incorporate these considerations to promote high-quality and consistent online offerings. We conclude the review by presenting four high-level considerations to guide these discussions. © 2023, The Online Learning Consortium. All rights reserved."
"Food safety is closely related to human health. Therefore, named entity recognition technology is used to extract named entities related to food safety, and building a regulatory knowledge graph in the field of food safety can help relevant authorities to regulate food safety issues and mitigate the hazards caused by food safety problems. However, there is no publicly available named entity recognition dataset in the food safety domain. In contrast, the non-standardized Chinese short texts generated from user comments on the web contain rich implicit information that can help identify named entities in specific domains (e.g., food safety domain) where the corpus is scarce. Therefore, in this paper, named entities related to food safety are extracted from these unstandardized texts on the web. However, the existing Chinese named entity identification methods are mainly for standardized texts. Meanwhile, these unstandardized texts have the following problems: (1) their corpus size is small; (2) there are various new and wrong words and noise; (3) and they do not follow strict syntactic rules. These problems make the recognition of Chinese named entities for online texts more challenging. Therefore, this paper proposes the ERNIE-Adv-BiLSTM-Att-CRF model to improve the recognition of food safety domain entities in unstandardized texts. Specifically, adversarial training is added to the model training as a regularization method to alleviate the influence of noise on the model, while self-attention is added to the BiLSTM-CRF model to capture features that significant impact entity classification and improve the accuracy of entity classification. This paper conducts experiments on the public dataset Weibo NER and the self-built food domain dataset Food. The experimental results show that our model achieves a SOTA performance of 72.64% and a good performance of 69.68% for F1 values on the public and self-built datasets, respectively. The validity and reasonableness of our model are verified. In addition, the paper further analyses the impact of various components and settings on the model. The study has practical implications in the field of food safety. © 2023 by the authors."
"The authors have proposed a method of reiterating the statistical analysis of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) of the UNFCCC Parties, which were updated at Conference of the Parties-26. The present analysis confirms the taxonomy developed in 2020, based on 2475 adaptive solutions recorded in 2022 NDCs, and discusses the differences observed. An ex ante adaptation metric is proposed, which allows monitoring of adaptive solutions over time and comparisons between projects in time and space. The fitness coefficient evaluates the ex ante relevance of these adaptive projects in relation to the climate challenges of each country. The authors have proposed a program of continuous improvement instead of a definitive calculation. The authors have developed an algorithm to automate the text analysis and minimize the subjectivity of the analysis. The objective is to assign a level of vulnerability to each project for each hazard in the country. The correspondence analysis was used to derive the most representative dimensions of project category dispersion and vulnerability intensities from a contingency table for each hazard. This coefficient can be made available to experts, project developers, and funders for ex ante evaluation and selection of candidate projects for funding before more in-depth analyses are carried out. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Non-fatal burns are a major cause of morbidity, with incidents often occuring at home and at work. Almost all burn cases occur in the WHO region, precisely in African and Southeast Asian countries. Yet, the epidemiology of these injuries, especially in the WHO-defined Southeast Asian Region, has yet to be adequately defined. Method: A scoping review of the literature was performed to identify epidemiology of thermal, chemical, and electrical burns in the WHO-defined Southeast Asian Region. The database search screened 1023 articles in total, of which 83 articles were assessed for eligibility at a full-text level, and 58 of these were excluded. Therefore, 25 fulltext articles were included for data extraction and analysis. Results: Data analysed included demographics, injury details, burn mechanism, total body surface area burned, and in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: Despite the steady increase on burns research, the Southeast Asian region is still limited in terms of burns data. This scoping review has shown that the largest set of articles on burns come from Southeast Asia, indicating the importance of reviewing data at a regional or local level, as global studies tend to be dominated by data from high-income countries. © 2023 MA Healthcare Ltd.

"The concept of axiological-semantic density from Legitimation Code Theory (LCT) is extremely helpful in analysing political knowledge-building, as it describes the strength of relations between various people, political stances and moral judgements, enabling these to be positioned in relation to each other. We present a multi-level translation device designed to identify strengths of axiological-semantic density in political news articles from the Daily Sun, South Africa's most popular tabloid newspaper. This translation device was devised through analysis of selected texts from a corpus of 516 articles published between January and June 2015. It was developed through a collaborative process involving the first author and a team of student research assistants. The final translation device has five tools, of which two, the wording and charging tools, are described in this article, and then illustrated using an example analysis of a Daily Sun political news article. Both tools reveal insights into South African political discourses and ways in which axiological-semantic density can be enacted in future research. Making axiological-semantic density visible using such a translation device also has practical applications in assisting readers to understand the ways in which publications such as the Daily Sun position political parties, enabling them to engage more constructively in discussions on the country's future.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"This essay offers a corpus-based linguistic analysis of the paratexts of the works of John Pechey (1654–1718), a licentiate physician and prolific medical author and popularizer, whose ideas and practice brought him into conflict with the Royal College of Physicians. Following the methodology of corpus-assisted discourse analysis, historical discourse analysis, and historical sociopragmatics, the essay analyses the paratextual material of Pechey's medical publications, with the aims of (a) collecting a corpus of texts published under his name, (b) assessing his role in the popularization of learned medicine, and (c) tracing how he constructed and performed his identity both as a knowledgeable medical practitioner and as a critic of the beliefs and practices of the Royal College of Physicians. © 2023 British Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies."
"BACKGROUND: Surgical randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have potential drawbacks, leading some to question their role in filling the information gap in orthopaedic surgery. Pragmatism in study design was introduced to increase the clinical applicability of study results. The purpose of this study was to examine how pragmatism affects the scholarly influence of surgical RCTs. METHODS: A search for surgical hip fracture-related RCTs published between 1995 and 2015 was done. Journal impact factor, citation number, research question, significance and type of outcome, number of centers involved, and the Pragmatic-Explanatory Continuum Indicator Summary-2 level of pragmatism score were recorded for each study. Scholarly influence was estimated by a study's inclusion into orthopaedic literature or guidelines or through the study's average yearly citation rate. RESULTS: One hundred sixty RCTs were included in the final analysis. A multivariate logistic regression identified large study sample size as the only predictor of an RCT being used in clinical guidance texts. Large sample size and multicenter RCTs were predictors of high yearly citation rates. The level of pragmatism in study design did not predict scholarly influence. CONCLUSIONS: Pragmatic design is not independently associated with increased scholarly influence; however, large study sample size was the most important study characteristic affecting scholarly influence.

"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a complex and multifactorial systemic disorder of the gastrointestinal tract and is strongly associated with the development of colorectal cancer. Despite extensive studies of IBD pathogenesis, the molecular mechanism of colitis-driven tumorigenesis is not yet fully understood. In the current animal-based study, we report a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of multiple transcriptomics datasets from the colon tissue of mice with acute colitis and colitis-associated cancer (CAC). We performed intersection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), their functional annotation, reconstruction, and topology analysis of gene association networks, which, when combined with the text mining approach, revealed that a set of key overexpressed genes involved in the regulation of colitis (C3, Tyrobp, Mmp3, Mmp9, Timp1) and CAC (Timp1, Adam8, Mmp7, Mmp13) occupied hub positions within explored colitis- and CAC-related regulomes. Further validation of obtained data in murine models of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and azoxymethane/DSS-stimulated CAC fully confirmed the association of revealed hub genes with inflammatory and malignant lesions of colon tissue and demonstrated that genes encoding matrix metalloproteinases (acute colitis: Mmp3, Mmp9; CAC: Mmp7, Mmp13) can be used as a novel prognostic signature for colorectal neoplasia in IBD. Finally, using publicly available transcriptomics data, translational bridge interconnecting of listed colitis/CAC-associated core genes with the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and colorectal cancer in humans was identified. Taken together, a set of key genes playing a core function in colon inflammation and CAC was revealed, which can serve both as promising molecular markers and therapeutic targets to control IBD and IBD-associated colorectal neoplasia. © 2023 by the authors."
"The role of the parliamentary arena and members of parliament (MPs) therein for both mainstreaming and cross-sectoral policy integration is largely unknown. Studying the case of Switzerland, this paper analyzes the integration of the biodiversity issue into policies of 20 different policy sectors over a period of 19 years to assess how two specific actor attributes—issue and sector specialization—increase the chances of MPs of engaging in both biodiversity mainstreaming and its cross-sectoral integration. The results based on a comprehensive collection of political documents from the parliamentary arena, and multilevel regression models show that an increase in MPs' sector specialization is associated with both a decrease in mainstreaming and a decrease in cross-sectoral integration activities. By contrast, an increase in issue specialization typically translates into biodiversity-related activity in a larger number of sectors. In the parliamentary arena, therefore, it is primarily a small group of “issue specialists” who take responsibility for the integration of crosscutting issues, such as biodiversity, into critical sectoral policies. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Shared electric scooters have recently emerged as an alternative mode of transportation in many cities around the globe. However, they can become a nuisance to residents when they are not well regulated. The approaches to prioritizing laws and regulations of shared electric scooters have not been explored extensively. Therefore, this study presented a multi-criteria approach for prioritizing electric scooter ordinances using Bloomington, Indiana's survey data. The study applied a descriptive analysis, text mining, and logistic regression on 1,891 responses. The responses were based on a questionnaire with 13 predefined ordinances and an additional comment section. The three criteria- the frequency of selection of ordinances, the sequence of selection of ordinances, and the ordinances associated with additional comments were used. Results revealed a great variation in the priorities of the ordinances when the three criteria are used. The frequency of selection criteria would highly favor the ordinance related to enforcing scooter riders to follow traffic laws, while both sequence of selection and additional comments would favor prohibiting scooters from the sidewalks. The policy implications of the multi-criteria and individual criteria are also presented. It is expected that jurisdictions would apply the approach presented in this study and the associated proposed alternatives when prioritizing the ordinances for electric scooters. © 2023 World Conference on Transport Research Society"
"Lithofacies paleogeography is a data-intensive discipline that involves the interpretation and compilation of sedimentary facies. Traditional sedimentary facies analysis is a labor-intensive task with the added complexity of using unstructured knowledge and unstandardized terminology. Therefore, it is very difficult for beginners or non-geology scholars who lack a systematic knowledge and experience in sedimentary facies analysis. These hurdles could be partly alleviated by having a standardized, structured, and systematic knowledge base coupled with an efficient automatic machine-assisted sedimentary facies identification system. To this end, this study constructed a knowledge system for fluvial facies and carried out knowledge representation. Components include a domain knowledge graph for types of fluvial facies (meandering, braided and other fluvial depositional environments) and their characteristic features (bedforms, grain size distribution, etc.) with visualization, a method for query and retrieval on a graph database platform, a hierarchical knowledge tree-structure, a data-mining clustering algorithm for machine-analysis of publication texts, and an algorithm model for this area of sedimentary facies reasoning. The underlying sedimentary facies identification and knowledge reasoning system is based on expert experience and synthesis of publications. For testing, 17 sets literature publications data that included details of sedimentary facies data (bedforms, grain sizes, etc.) were submitted to the artificial intelligence model, then compared and validated. This testing set of automated reasoning results yielded an interpretation accuracy of about 90% relative to the published interpretations in those papers. Therefore, the model and algorithm provide an efficient and automated reasoning technology, which provides a new approach and route for the rapid and intelligent identification of other types of sedimentary facies from literature data or direct use in the field. © 2022 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University"
"Language models have proved to achieve high performances and outperform state of the art results in the Natural Language Processing field. More specifically, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has become the state of the art model for such tasks. Most of the available language models have been trained on Indo-European languages. These models are known to require huge training datasets. However, only a few studies have focused on under-represented languages and dialects. In this work, we describe the pretraining of a customized Google BERT Tensorflow implementation model (named TunBERT-T) and the pretraining of a PyTorch implementation of BERT language model using NVIDIA implementation (named TunBERT-P) for the Tunisian dialect. We describe the process of creating a training dataset from collecting a Common-Crawl-based dataset, filtering and pre-processing the data. We describe the training setup and we detail fine-tuning TunBERT-T and TunBERT-P models on three NLP downstream tasks. We challenge the assumption that a lot of training data is needed. We explore the effectiveness of training a monolingual Transformer-based language model for low-resourced languages, taking the Tunisian dialect as a use case. Our models results indicate that a proportionately small sized Common-Crawl-based dataset (500K sentences, 67.2MB) leads to comparable performances as those obtained using costly larger datasets (from 24GB to 128GB of text). We demonstrate that with the use of newly created datasets, our proposed TunBERT-P model achieves comparable or higher performances in three downstream tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Language Identification and Reading Comprehension Question-Answering. We release the two pretrained models along with all the datasets used for the fine-tuning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"Background: Accident and Emergency Department (AED) is the frontline of providing emergency care in a hospital and research focusing on improving decision-makings and service level around AED has been driving a rising number of attentions in recent years. A retrospective review among the published papers shows that related research can be classified according to six planning modules: demand forecasting, days-off scheduling, shift scheduling, line-of-work construction, task assignment and staff assignment. As patient arrivals demand forecasts enable smooth AED operational planning and help decision-making, this article conducted a systematic review on the statistical modelling approaches aimed at predicting the volume of AED patients’ arrival. Methods: We carried out a systematic review of AED patient arrivals prediction studies from 2004 to 2021. The Medline, ScienceDirect, and Scopus databases were searched. A two-step screening process was carried out based on the title and abstract or full text, and 35 of 1,677 articles were selected. Our methods and results follow the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We categorise AED methods for modelling patient arrivals into four main classes: regression, time series, artificial intelligence and time series regression. Choice of prediction model, selection of factors and model performance are compared. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the models and suggest future research directions. Results: A total of 1,677 papers that fulfilled the initial searching criteria was obtained from the three databases. Based on the first exclusion criteria, 1,603 articles were eliminated. The remaining 74 full text articles were evaluated based on the second exclusion criteria. Finally, 35 articles were selected for full review. We find that the use of artificial intelligence-based model has risen in recent years, from the view of predictive model selection. The calendar-based factors are most commonly used compared with other types of dependent variables, from the view of dependent variable selection. Conclusions: All AEDs are inherently different and different covariables may have different effects on patient arrivals. Certain factors may play a key role in one AED but not others. Based on results of meta-analysis, when modelling patient arrivals, it is essential to understand the actual AED situation and carefully select relevant dominating factors and the most suitable modelling method. Local calibration is also important to ensure good estimates. © Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery. All rights reserved."
"Muslims in the U.K. who maintain their religious culture are often viewed as a suspect community. This pre-registered experimental research examined the mediating role of perceived (dis)loyalty as underlying process and the moderating role of acculturation expectations. A total of 334 non-Muslim White British participants in Study 1 and 810 in Study 2 were asked to indicate their acculturation expectations towards Muslims. They were then randomly assigned to read a text that described Muslims in a fictional town as either (a) maintaining their religious culture or (b) adopting the mainstream British culture, or they read (c) a neutral control text. As expected, in Study 1, when Muslims were presented as maintaining their religious culture, trust decreased compared to the control group. Conversely, when described as adopting the mainstream culture, trust increased while support for surveillance of Muslims decreased. Both effects were mediated by the perception of Muslims being disloyal or loyal to the U.K in both studies, respectively. Perceived loyalty to their religious group did not significantly mediate any effect. We replicated these findings in Study 2. Moreover, we showed that describing Muslims as maintaining their religious culture decreased trust and increased support for surveillance especially among participants who expected Muslims to give up their religious culture. Moderated mediation analysis showed that these effects were partly mediated by perceived loyalty to the U.K. We discuss the societal implications of the findings for policymakers and Muslim leaders along with recommendations for future research. © 2023"
"Introduction: Dapagliflozin, a new treatment option for heart failure, leads to a significant reduction in the hospitalization of patients with heart failure. We aimed to review studies on the economic evaluation of adding dapagliflozin to standard care compared with standard care alone in heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Methods: For this systematic review, the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane, Scopus, and CEA Registry scientific databases were searched from 1 January 2020 to 25 March 2022. Two of the present researchers screened titles and abstracts, extracted data from full-text articles, and evaluated their quality using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) checklist for the quality assessment of health economic studies. Results: Of the 456 abstracts screened, 19 studies met the inclusion criteria. The mean QHES score for the studies was 0.87 (high quality). Eight studies on cost-effectiveness analysis, ten studies on cost-utility analysis, and one study on cost-minimization analysis were conducted. Based on the available evidence and the present findings, the addition of dapagliflozin to standard care in patients with HFrEF was cost effective in most countries. Conclusions: Based on the results of the present study, the addition of dapagliflozin to standard care in patients with HFrEF was cost effective. More studies investigating the cost effectiveness of dapagliflozin in patients with HFrEF are required in light of the actual epidemiological data of countries in the relevant input parameters. It is also recommended to conduct cost-effectiveness studies of dapagliflozin taking into account costs and benefits from a societal perspective. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"The gastronomy of a destination can be a competitive advantage, but there is no study on how the gastronomy of Málaga is perceived. Therefore, the present study has tried to resolve this lack of information in order to contribute to the future development of strategies. A database of 1228 user-generated comments was compiled with the opinions of tourists. After the application of content analysis software, frequent topics and concepts, thematic clusters, text characteristics and positive and negative areas of the text were identified, as well as attributes that have practical implications for companies in the sector. The results show the concepts associated to our gastronomy, highlighting attributes such as the freshness of the food and its flavor and quality. Additionally, it was found that favorable opinions were mainly related to the food, while negative ones were related to the service. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."
"Objective: Cognitive measures are an important primary outcome of pediatric, adolescents, and childhood epilepsy surgery. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess whether there are long-term alterations (≥ 5 years) in the Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) of pediatric patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. Methods: Electronic databases (EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Scopus) were searched for English articles from inception to October 2022 that examined intelligence outcomes in pediatric epilepsy surgery patients. Inclusion criteria were defined as the patient sample size of ≥ 5, average follow- up of ≥5 years, and surgeries performed on individuals ≤ 18 years old at the time of surgery. Exclusion criteria consisted of palliative surgery, animal studies, and studies not reporting surgical or FSIQ outcomes. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) toolset was used for quality appraisal of the selected articles. A random-effects network meta-analysis was performed to compare FSIQ between surgical patients at baseline and follow-up and Mean Difference (MD) was used to calculate the effect size of each study. Point estimates for effects and 95% confidence intervals for moderation analysis were performed on variables putatively associated with the effect size. Results: 21,408 studies were screened for abstract and title. Of these, 797 fit our inclusion and exclusion criteria and proceeded to full-text screening. Overall, seven studies met our requirements and were selected. Quantitative analysis was performed on these studies (N = 330). The mean long-term difference between pre- and post- operative FSIQ scores across all studies was noted at 3.36 [95% CI: (0.14, 6.57), p = 0.04, I2 = 0%] and heterogeneity was low. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to measure the long-term impacts of FSIQ in pediatric and adolescent epilepsy patients. Our overall results in this meta-analysis indicate that while most studies do not show long-term FSIQ deterioration in pediatric patients who underwent epilepsy surgery, there was an increase of 3.36 FSIQ points, however, the observed changes were not clinically significant. Moreover, at the individual patient level analysis, while most children did not show long-term FSIQ deterioration, few had significant decline. These findings indicate the importance of surgery as a viable option for pediatric patients with medically refractory epilepsy. © 2023"
"This study examines the Korean translations of a Japanese work Joshi no rongo [/Women's Analects] (Yuki, Ako . 2011. Tokyo: Sunmark Publishing House), a modern interpretation of the Chinese classic The Analects, with a view to identifying how the paratexts of a translated text contributed, or hindered the reception of the work in the target culture. By drawing on Gérard Genette's (1997 [1987]. Paratexts: Threshold of interpretation, Jane E. Lewin (trans.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) concept of ""paratexts,""this study both analyses translation shifts in the peritexts (e.g., cover, foreword, table of contents) and the epitexts (reviews) of the Korean translations. The analysis shows that the additions and rearrangements of some paratextual elements in the Korean translation further reinforced the traditional view presented in the source text, which ironically brought about heavy criticisms of the original Japanese text and resulted in the Korean retranslation of the work. The scrutiny of peritexts and epitexts in this article will enhance our understanding of the interactions between the translator, the publisher, and the public readers, which jointly contextualize the production and reception of a translated work in a given culture.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"In this paper, I try to expatiate on the poetic function of language on the basis of considerations by Jakobson and Waugh. I try to bring in the consideration that pragmatics plays an important role in elucidating the poetic function of language. Contextualism allows us to interpret a poem: referents must be fixed or need not be fixed due to the requirements of the discourse; citations are brought in through pragmatic ways; polyphony is achieved by taking into account the context of previous analyses of a poetic text; the vicinity of a certain word, or concept or line is likely to affect the interpretation of a certain expression; the poetic text can take different forms, from graffiti to discourse at the market place, to discourse between lovers. All these forms of poetic text would not exist if the notion of poetry did not include the idea of semantic/pragmatic compression which is matched, in interpretation, by expansions.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"The use of transformer-based language models in artificial intelligence (AI) has increased adoption in various industries and led to significant productivity advancements in business operations. This article explores how these models can be used to augment human innovation teams in the new product development process, allowing for larger problem and solution spaces to be explored and ultimately leading to higher innovation performance. The article proposes the use of the AI-augmented double diamond framework to structure the exploration of how these models can assist in new product development (NPD) tasks, such as text summarization, sentiment analysis, and idea generation. It also discusses the limitations of the technology and the potential impact of AI on established practices in NPD.

"Context: Execution logs capture the run-time behavior of software systems. To assist developers in their maintenance tasks, many studies have proposed tools to analyze execution information from logs. However, it is as yet unknown how industry developers use logs in embedded software engineering. Objective: In this study, we aim to understand how developers use logs in an embedded software engineering context. Specifically, we would like to gain insights into the type of logs developers analyze, the purposes for which developers analyze logs, the information developers need from logs and their expectation on tool support. Method: In order to achieve the aim, we conducted these interview studies. First, we interviewed 25 software developers from ASML, which is a leading company in developing lithography machines. This exploratory case study provides the preliminary findings. Next, we validated and refined our findings by conducting a replication study. We involved 14 interviewees from four companies who have different software engineering roles in their daily work. Results: As the result of our first study, we compile a preliminary taxonomy which consists of four types of logs used by developers in practice, 18 purposes of using logs, 13 types of information developers search in logs, 13 challenges faced by developers in log analysis and three suggestions for tool support provided by developers. This taxonomy is refined in the replication study with three additional purposes, one additional information need, four additional challenges and three additional suggestions of tool support. In addition, with these two studies, we observed that text-based editors and self-made scripts are commonly used when it comes to tooling in log analysis practice. As indicated by the interviewees, the development of automatic analysis tools is hindered by the quality of the logs, which further suggests several challenges in log instrumentation and management. Conclusions: Based on our study, we provide suggestions for practitioners on logging practices. We provide implications for tool builders on how to further improve tools based on existing techniques. Finally, we suggest some research directions and studies for researchers to further study software logging. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Recently, social media data have been leveraged for product defect discovery. But the considerable number of defects reflected via social media inhibits manufacturers from solving product defects promptly. Extant studies focus on identifying defect-relevant texts and then deriving defects discussed in texts. They omit to assess the importance of discovered defects and find the defects with high priorities. In this study, we first developed a topic model named Defect Analysis Model (DAM) to discover product defects from defect-related texts, which are identified by the integrated BERT and Random Forest. Then we propose the Two-Phased Quality Function Deployment for Defect (TPQFDD) to prioritize discovered product defects. With the consideration of defect frequencies and defect costs, TPQFDD evaluates the importance of defective components, defects, and defect causes for more inspired managerial insights. We compare our approaches with baseline approaches using an online thread dataset of automobiles. Comparison results prove that our methods effectively detect and prioritize product defects that occurred in the aftersales stage. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"Objective Temporal bone mucosal melanomas (MMs) are rare, and patients may experience delays in diagnosis and treatment. Our objective was to better characterize the presentation, diagnosis, treatment modalities, and outcomes of this process. Data Sources PubMed/Medline, CINAHL (EBSCOhost), and Web of Science databases were searched in all languages without restriction of publication dates. Study Selection Inclusion criteria included that the article was either a case report or a case series with individual case data. All non-English articles were excluded if the corresponding abstract lacked data on demographics, initial presentation, and clinical management. Data Extraction After full-text analysis, data pertaining to demographics, diagnosis, medical and surgical management modalities, and outcomes were extracted. Data Synthesis Data were qualitatively synthesized, and means and averages were obtained for all continuous variables. Overall survival was measured by the Kaplan-Meier method, and significance was measured through log-rank testing. Conclusions Clinicians should suspect temporal bone MM in the differential diagnosis of patients with bloody otorrhea in the context of a chronic serous otitis media or an associated cranial nerve palsy. If suspected, physicians should not delay the acquisition of a biopsy or imaging studies. Management is highly variable and must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Outcomes remain poor because of the high propensity for MM to metastasize.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."
"Text classification (TC) is a crucial subject. The number of digital files available on the internet is enormous. The goal of TC is to categorize texts into a series of predetermined groups. The number of studies conducted on the English database is significantly higher than the number of studies conducted on the Arabic database. Therefore, this research analyzes the performance of automatic TC of the Arabic language using Machine Learning (ML) approaches. Further, Single-label Arabic News Articles Datasets (SANAD) are introduced, which contain three different datasets, namely Akhbarona, Khaleej, and Arabiya. Initially, the collected texts are pre-processed in which tokenization and stemming occur. In this research, three kinds of stemming are employed, namely light stemming, Khoja stemming, and nostemming, to evaluate the effect of the pre-processing technique on Arabic TC performance. Moreover, feature extraction and feature weighting are performed; in feature weighting, the term weighting process is completed by the term frequencyinverse document frequency (tf-idf) method. In addition, this research selects C4.5, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes (NB) as a classification algorithm. The results indicated that the SVM and NB methods had attained higher accuracy than the C4.5 method. NB achieved the maximum accuracy with a performance of 99.9%. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor."
"Blockchain and immersive technology are the pioneers in bringing digitalization to tourism, and researchers worldwide are exploring many facets of these techniques. This paper analyzes the various aspects of blockchain technology and its potential use in tourism. We explore high-frequency keywords, perform network analysis of relevant publications to analyze patterns, and introduce machine learning techniques to facilitate systematic reviews. We focused on 94 publications from Web Science that dealt with blockchain implementation in tourism from 2017 to 2022. We used Vosviewer for network analysis and artificial intelligence models with the help of machine learning tools to predict the relevance of the work. Many reviewed articles mainly deal with blockchain in tourism and related terms such as smart tourism and crypto tourism. This study is the first attempt to use text analysis to improve the topic modeling of blockchain in tourism. It comprehensively analyzes the technology’s potential use in the hospitality, accommodation, and booking industry. In this context, the paper provides significant value to researchers by giving an insight into the trends and keyword patterns. Tourism still has many unexplored areas; journal articles should also feature special studies on this topic. © 2023 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
"High-Dimensional Processing is the idea that mind register illustrations of neural activities which are not immediately related with numbers. The objective of the article is hyper-dimensional computation of data for categorization of text from two distinct speech datasets, namely the Arabic Corpus dataset and the MediaSpeech dataset with four languages (Arabic, Spanish, French, and Turkish). Through the use of an n-gram encoding scheme, hyper dimensional computing is used to conduct the analysis from the prior set of data. Using hyper dimensional computing, the MediaSpeech dataset accomplishes 100% accuracy for all 4-gram to 14-gram encoding schemes, while the Arabic Corpus dataset accomplishes 100% accuracy for 4-gram to 7-gram encoding schemes. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor."

"This paper examines the controversy that followed the 1987 publication of Joseph Greenberg's book, Language in the Americas, attending to the role of language and linguistic research within overlapping disciplinary traditions. With this text, Greenberg presented a macro-level tripartite classification that opposed then dominant fine-grained analyses recognizing anywhere from 150 to 200 distinct language families. His proposal was the subject of a landmark conference, examining strengths and weaknesses, the unpublished proceedings of which are presented here for the first time. For specialists in the anthropological and comparative-historical study of Indigenous American languages, Greenberg's intervention highlighted the tension between language, conceived as an abstract object of study, and languages, understood to be carriers of specific cultural knowledge. For physical anthropologists and archaeologists, his theory was initially fortuitous on programmatic, substantive, and methodological grounds. The essay will show how interdisciplinary appeals were figured by supporters as a virtue, and by critics as a vice. The essay further highlights ethical reasons for integrating historical narratives of science and the humanities. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH."
"International regimes contain norm bundles with several distinct norms that jointly define what is expected from parties. As states engage with these regime-inherent norms, they attribute meanings to them. Moreover, they can also translate norms extraneous to the regime. Here we take a theoretical middle ground between full-fledged norm adoption and approaches that emphasize the novelty of each translation. We argue that norm translations may be largely shared among states with similar domestic contexts. This includes individual translations of norms as well as prioritizations between them. Empirically, we focus on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by applying unsupervised quantitative text analysis (topic modeling) to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted around the 2015 Paris conference. Studying these implementation pledges, we find that states have mostly engaged in regime-inherent norm translations, indicating normative stability of the regime. This occurred in distinct forms, such as by translating mitigation responsibilities in the form of absolute or relative emission reduction targets. We find hints that norm translations indeed vary in line with states’ domestic context factors: Beyond broad differences between industrialized and developing countries, we show the relevance of factors like vulnerability to climate change and emissions levels. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited."
"Poor intrinsic thermal conductivity (TC) of beta-phase gallium oxide ( β -Ga2O3) poses challenges to the thermal management of its devices. Various packaging-level cooling strategies have been proposed, demonstrating great thermal benefits. In addition, much attention has been paid to the device-level cooling methods, which have shown remarkable efficiency for the thermal management of many wide and ultrawide bandgap devices. As the device-level thermal management efficiency is highly associated with the device architecture, deep insight into the device architecture effect is highly warranted. Here, we used numerical simulation method to conduct the device-level thermal analysis on β -Ga2O3 MESFETs. The impacts of various device components on channel temperature are comprehensively investigated, such as metal geometry, layout alignment, thickness, and orientation-dependent β -Ga2O3 TCs, and the thermal boundary resistance (TBR) between metal and β -Ga2O3. We show that increasing the gate length from 0.5 to 1.5 μ achieves a 35 K reduction in maximum channel temperature, equivalent to optimizing the device's substrate TC from 100 to 2000 W/mK. Furthermore, properly designing the layout alignment on the 3-D anisotropic β -Ga2O3 substrate could also benefit the thermal dissipation. Particularly, aligning the gate length to the direction at which β -Ga2O3 has the highest and lowest in-plane TC could render ∼ 60 K difference in maximum channel temperature. Overall, we analyzed the efficiency of various device-level cooling strategies for the β -Ga2O3 device, suggesting a thermal design route by designing device architecture.  © 1963-2012 IEEE."
"Background and Hypothesis: Disturbances in self-experience are a central feature of schizophrenia and its study can enhance phenomenological understanding and inform mechanisms underlying clinical symptoms. Self-experience involves the sense of self-presence, of being the subject of one's own experiences and agent of one's own actions, and of being distinct from others. Self-experience is traditionally assessed by manual rating of interviews; however, natural language processing (NLP) offers automated approach that can augment manual ratings by rapid and reliable analysis of text. Study Design: We elicited autobiographical narratives from 167 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (SZ) and 90 healthy controls (HC), amounting to 490 000 words and 26 000 sentences. We used NLP techniques to examine transcripts for language related to self-experience, machine learning to validate group differences in language, and canonical correlation analysis to examine the relationship between language and symptoms. Study Results: Topics related to self-experience and agency emerged as significantly more expressed in SZ than HC (P < 10-13) and were decoupled from similarly emerging features such as emotional tone, semantic coherence, and concepts related to burden. Further validation on hold-out data showed that a classifier trained on these features achieved patient-control discrimination with AUC = 0.80 (P < 10-5). Canonical correlation analysis revealed significant relationships between self-experience and agency language features and clinical symptoms. Conclusions: Notably, the self-experience and agency topics emerged without any explicit probing by the interviewer and can be algorithmically detected even though they involve higher-order metacognitive processes. These findings illustrate the utility of NLP methods to examine phenomenological aspects of schizophrenia. © 2022 The Author(s)."
"This article presents an unprecedented analysis of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) primary school physical education curriculum focused on calligraphy and illustrations. Indeed, this research concentrated on describing, analyzing and understanding the context and the philosophy of the document, as well as its illustrations (Islamic calligraphy, pictures, among others). Semiotic and iconographic methods were used to conduct analyses of the data. Findings show several attempts to divert the meaning of the Muslim religion, notably through an ultra-rigorist vision and a total absence of girls or women. Our analyses lead us to believe that this curriculum, addressed mainly to the physical education teacher, was developed by ISIS as a preamble to the military preparation of future soldiers. Finally, the Islamic calligraphy used in the curriculum raises questions about the choice of type of calligraphy as well as its relevance within the context of an incomplete and rapidly developed document. This study provides a deeper understanding of the educational system set up by ISIS and its body of disciplinary texts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"The recognition of symbols within document images is one of the most relevant steps involved in the Document Analysis field. While current state-of-the-art methods based on Deep Learning are capable of adequately performing this task, they generally require a vast amount of data that has to be manually labeled. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning-based method that addresses this task by training a neural-based feature extractor with a set of unlabeled documents and performs the recognition task considering just a few reference samples. Experiments on different corpora comprising music, text, and symbol documents report that the proposal is capable of adequately tackling the task with high accuracy rates of up to 95% in few-shot settings. Moreover, results show that the presented strategy outperforms the base supervised learning approaches trained with the same amount of data that, in some cases, even fail to converge. This approach, hence, stands as a lightweight alternative to deal with symbol classification with few annotated data. © 2023 The Author(s)"
"The video-centered platform, TikTok, has gained popularity due to its position as an entertainment app, but it is still underexplored as a tool that generates awareness and discussions about mental health. This article explores TikTok's data-point ranking system to analyze how mental health rhetoric is shaped and how public health communities are formed around the term anxiety. Through a multimodal discourse analysis of the top 10 TikTok videos using the hashtag, #anxiety, this article seeks to establish how discussions of anxiety disorders are facilitated through the use of TikTok's socio-technical features and affordances of visibility, editability, persistence, and association in order to build digital communities of support. I identify recurring themes in users’ narrations of anxiety by studying in-frame content that creates meaning and contextual messages about mental health. Ultimately, these multimodal expressions of anxiety allow users to intervene and discuss often serious topics related to mental health through video, text, images, and sounds that other users can relate to and recognize. These features and affordances create networks of community and attract conversation where others can share their experiences and practices. © 2023"
"Due to the 2019 new coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, tourism is undergoing fundamental changes that are affecting tourism research. This situation calls for in-depth analyses of tourism research. Scholars have already published review studies on COVID-19-related research within the tourism field; however, these studies do not connect findings, such as the research focus, research methodology and target group, to form a research profile, and the geographical patterns of the findings are not identified. study, COVID-19-related tourism studies were collected and analyzed in depth following the Preferred Reporting Items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) method. In addition, data-driven methods, such as spatial multilayer networks, frequent patterns and content-based analyses, were applied to identify research profiles and their geographic patterns. This study pointed out the role of geographic patterns in tourism research, going beyond the research of the authors. Moreover, topics, focus destinations, applied methodologies and employed data sources have relevant geographic patterns. Four dominant research profiles that show that a shift can be observed in tourism research toward data sources and research methods were identified. Due to COVID-19, the strengthening of the application of quantitative methods and employment of secondary data sources are needed. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Introduction: The objective of this systematic review is to describe polysubstance studies and their prevalence estimates among pregnant people in the US. Methods: This review was not subject to protocol preparation or registration with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) because outcome data were not reported. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Checklist was followed. Four scientific literature databases were used to identify articles published from January 1, 2009 to June 3, 2020 reporting prenatal exposure to two or more substances in the US. A standardized process of title and abstract screening followed by a two-phase full-text review was used to assess study eligibility. Results: A total of 119 studies were included: 7 case–control studies, 7 clinical trials, 76 cohort studies, and 29 cross-sectional studies. Studies varied with respect to study design, time period, region, sampling and participant selection, substances assessed, and method of exposure ascertainment. Commonly reported polysubstance prevalence estimates among studies of pregnant people included combinations with alcohol, marijuana, and/or tobacco/nicotine. The range of prevalence estimates was wide (alcohol 1–99%; marijuana 3–95%; tobacco/nicotine 2–95%). Discussion: Polysubstance use during pregnancy is common, especially with alcohol, marijuana, and/or tobacco/nicotine. Future research to assess polysubstance use during pregnancy could help better describe patterns and ultimately help mitigate its effects on maternal and infant health outcomes. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Brazil has recently been experiencing a phenomenon of political polarization: a conflict involving political views and social identities. Considering the extent to which this socially constructed conflict has been partially fueled by the media, we propose to use the Social Representations Theory. The present study explores how discourses in the mainstream media construct the political polarization taking place in Brazil. The topics covered in 82 texts published between January 2015 and August 2019 in Brazilian mainstream press, Folha da S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo, were examined using content analysis and Reinert's method with IRaMuTeQ software. A descending hierarchical analysis divided the corpus into four classes, and content analysis showed that both daily newspapers strongly criticized the political polarization underway, which was anchored to and objectified through episodes of violence, and they supported the valorization of democracy. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"Translocations are an important conservation tool that enable the restoration of species and their ecological functions. They are particularly important during the current environmental crisis. We used a combination of text-analysis tools to track the history and evolution of the peer-reviewed scientific literature on animal translocation science. We compared this corpus with research showcased in the IUCNs Global Conservation Translocation Perspectives, a curated collection of non-peer-reviewed reintroduction case studies. We show that the peer-reviewed literature, in its infancy, was dominated by charismatic species. It then grew in two classical threads: management of the species of concern and management of the environment of the species. The peer-reviewed literature exhibits a bias towards large charismatic mammals, and while these data are invaluable, expansion to under-represented groups such as insects and reptiles will be critical to combating biodiversity loss across taxonomic groups. These biases were similar in the Translocation Perspectives, but with some subtle differences. To ensure translocation science can address global issues, we need to overcome barriers that restrict this research to a limited number of countries. © 2023 The Authors.

"Objective: Outpatient no-shows have important implications for costs and the quality of care. Predictive models of no-shows could be used to target intervention delivery to reduce no-shows. We reviewed the effectiveness of predictive model-based interventions on outpatient no-shows, intervention costs, acceptability, and equity. Materials and Methods: Rapid systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs. We searched Medline, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, IEEE Xplore, and Clinical Trial Registries on March 30, 2022 (updated on July 8, 2022). Two reviewers extracted outcome data and assessed the risk of bias using ROB 2, ROBINS-I, and confidence in the evidence using GRADE. We calculated risk ratios (RRs) for the relationship between the intervention and no-show rates (primary outcome), compared with usual appointment scheduling. Meta-Analysis was not possible due to heterogeneity. Results: We included 7 RCTs and 1 non-RCT, in dermatology (n = 2), outpatient primary care (n = 2), endoscopy, oncology, mental health, pneumology, and an magnetic resonance imaging clinic. There was high certainty evidence that predictive model-based text message reminders reduced no-shows (1 RCT, median RR 0.91, interquartile range [IQR] 0.90, 0.92). There was moderate certainty evidence that predictive model-based phone call reminders (3 RCTs, median RR 0.61, IQR 0.49, 0.68) and patient navigators reduced no-shows (1 RCT, RR 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.46, 0.67). The effect of predictive model-based overbooking was uncertain. Limited information was reported on cost-effectiveness, acceptability, and equity. Discussion and Conclusions: Predictive modeling plus text message reminders, phone call reminders, and patient navigator calls are probably effective at reducing no-shows. Further research is needed on the comparative effectiveness of predictive model-based interventions addressed to patients at high risk of no-shows versus nontargeted interventions addressed to all patients.  © 2022 The Author(s).

"Introduction: Optimising clinical education in radiography is crucial to ensure competent graduates provide safe and effective patient care. Radiographers play a vital role in student supervision undertaken in the complex clinical environment. A greater understanding of factors influencing their ability to undertake this role effectively is needed. The study aimed to explore radiographers' attitudes and perceptions of confidence in undertaking clinical supervision and perceived barriers in a ‘real-life’ clinical department. Methods: The lens of Bandura's social-cognitive theory was utilised to assist the exploration of the desired constructs. An anonymous online survey was developed and circulated among qualified radiographers in Ireland. Descriptive (frequencies and percentages) and inferential statistical testing was undertaken. Thematic analysis was conducted on optional free-text comments. Results: 217 responses were received. Although most radiographers reported a positive attitude (73.3%), a significant minority reported not being confident across survey items related to the tasks required (ranging from 20.7%–29.1%). Time pressures from clinical workload, perceived lack of organisational support, and lack of guidance on expectations were highlighted challenges. Conclusion: The survey has enabled first-hand identification of some challenges radiographers encounter in undertaking students' clinical supervision. Radiographers must be supported to optimise the clinical learning environment where both students and educators are valued. Implications for practice: The findings highlight impact on educational support, practice, policy and future research. Effective clinical supervision is dependent on collaborative engagement and support being evident at all levels, including the clinical department, academic and healthcare institutions, and national organisations. © 2023 The College of Radiographers"
"With the advent of digital transformation, organizations increasingly rely on various information systems to support their business processes (BPs). Recorded data, including textual data and event log, expand exponentially, complicating decision-making and posing new challenges for BP complexity analysis in Business Process Management (BPM). Herein, Process Mining (PM) serves to derive insights based on historic BP execution data, called event log. However, in PM, textual data is often neglected or limited to BP descriptions. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel approach for analyzing BP execution complexity by combining textual data serving as an input at the BP start and event log. The approach is aimed at studying the connection between complexities obtained from these two data types. For textual data-based complexity, the approach employs a set of linguistic features. In our previous work, we have explored the design of linguistic features favorable for BP execution complexity prediction. Accordingly, we adapt and incorporate them into the proposed approach. Using these features, various machine learning techniques are applied to predict textual data-based complexity. Moreover, in this prediction, we show the adequacy of our linguistic features, which outperformed the linguistic features of a widely-used text analysis technique. To calculate event log-based complexity, the event log and relevant complexity metrics are used. Afterward, a correlation analysis of two complexities and an analysis of the significant differences in correlations are performed. The results serve to derive recommendations and insights for BP improvement. We apply the approach in the IT ticket handling process of the IT department of an academic institution. Our findings show that the suggested approach enables a comprehensive identification of BP redesign and improvement opportunities. © 2023 The Author(s)"
"Objective: Dysphagia is the most commonly reported complication of annterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery. However, the incidence of dysphagia post-ACDF varies widely–partly attributable to differing outcome measures used to capture dysphagia. Our objective was to conduct a scoping review of the literature to quantify which dysphagia outcome measures have been employed post-ACDF and examine trends by study design, year, and location. Methods: After removing duplicates, 2396 abstracts were screened for inclusion. A total of 480 studies were eligible for full-text review. After applying exclusion criteria, data was extracted from 280 studies. We extracted the dysphagia outcome measure(s), study design (prospective vs retrospective), year, and location (country). Approximately 10% of studies were repeated for intra-rater agreement. Results: In total, 317 dysphagia outcome measures were reported in 280 studies (primarily retrospective—63%). The largest proportion of outcome measures were categorized as “unvalidated patient-reported outcome measures” (46%), largely driven by use of the popular Bazaz scale. The next most common categories were “insufficient detail” and “validated patient-reported outcome measures” (both 16%) followed by “chart review/database” (13%) and instrumental assessment (7%). Studies examining dysphagia post-ACDF steadily increased over the years and the use of validated measures increased in the past 10 years. Conclusions: This scoping review of the literature highlights that nearly half of the ACDF dysphagia literature relies on unvalidated patient-reported outcome measures. The current understanding of the mechanism, timeline, and presentation of dysphagia post-ACDF are likely limited due to the metrics that are most commonly reported in the literature. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Despite the widespread use of interpretive structural modeling (ISM) in business research, little is known about its overall scientific productivity and impact on business research. This study presents a comprehensive review of the published ISM research and its latest editions in business using text mining. A two-tier review (narrative and systematic) is used to examine the methods and provide a comprehensive bibliometric analysis and an application roadmap. We demonstrate the number of ISM publications has been increasing in the past fifteen years, even though ISM was developed half a century ago. The study provides evidence for the increasing impact of ISM research in business. Content analysis shows an increase in the application of an updated edition of ISM, total interpretive structural modeling (TISM). In addition, the overall scientific productivity of ISM and TISM is assessed, and an ISM/TISM method selection roadmap is proposed. We further develop ISM+, a new integrated framework combining ISM and its latest editions to improve its performance and potential applications in business research. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"Objectives: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the proportion and risk factors of lymphoceles and symptomatic lymphoceles after PLND in early-stage cervical and early-stage high or high-intermediate risk endometrial cancer. Methods: Studies reporting on the proportion of lymphocele after PLND were conducted in PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library. Retrieved studies were screened on title/abstract and full text by two reviewers independently. Quality assessment was conducted using the Newcastle Ottowa Scale and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Proportion of lymphocele and possible risk factors were pooled through random-effects meta-analyses. Results: From the 233 studies retrieved, 24 studies were included. The pooled proportion of lymphocele was 14% and of symptomatic lymphocele was 3%. Routinely performing diagnostics was associated with a significantly higher proportion of lymphocele compared to diagnostics performed on indication (21% versus 4%, p < 0.01). Laparotomic surgical approach led to a significantly higher proportion of lymphoceles than laparoscopic surgical approach (18% versus 7%, p = 0.05). The proportion of lymphocele was significantly higher when >15% of the study population underwent additional paraaortic lymph node dissection (PAOLND) opposed to <15% (15% versus 3%, p < 0.01). A mean number of lymph nodes dissected of <21 resulted in a significantly higher pooled proportion of lymphoceles opposed to when the mean number was 21 or higher (19% versus 5%, p = 0.02). Other risk factors analysed were BMI, lymph node metastasis, adjuvant radiotherapy and follow up. There was no sufficient data to detect significant risk factors for the development of symptomatic lymphoceles. Conclusion: The pooled proportion of lymphocele was 14% of which symptomatic lymphoceles occurred in 3%. Significant risk factors for the total proportion of lymphoceles were laparotomic approach, decreased number of lymph nodes dissected and additional PAOLND. © 2023 The Authors"
"This paper describes the effect of analysis window functions on the performance of Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) based speaker recognition (SR). The MFCCs of speech signal are extracted from the fixed length frames using Short Time Fourier Analysis (STFA) technique where an appropriate analysis window function is required to extract frames from the complete speech signal of a speaker prior to STFA. The number of frames are consider as the number of MFCC feature vectors of a speaker which uniquely represents the speaker in feature space (domain). For the recognition purpose Vector Quantization (VQ) and/or Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and/or Universal Background Model GMM (UBM-GMM) based classifiers are used and a comparative study is made. Generally in state-of-the-art MFCC feature vector extraction, Hamming (in some places abbreviated as Ham in this paper) window function is used, but here we also examine the effect of other window functions like rectangular window, Hann window, B-spline windows, polynomial windows, adjustable windows, hybrid windows and Lanczos window in SR. In the present paper, we briefly describe the analysis window functions and try to evaluate text-independent speaker identification (SI). We also use voice activity detector (VAD) to discard the silence frames before STFA. Indeed, silence frames removal leads to the better performance of SR because MFCC of silent frames make the MFCC feature space intrinsic (MFCC with impurity). Here IITG MV SR database contains speech signal of speakers recorded by different devices, namely, D01, H01, T01, M01 and M02, in different environment, different language, different session. This is the reason for calling the database multi variability. It is observed that VQ classifier performs better than other GMM based classifiers for this database and the classifiers VQ-GMM, VQ-UGM-GMM and the combination of them suffers from singularity problem of covariance matrix. So we evaluate the performance of device D01 for all the classifiers and the three classifiers namely, GMM, UBM-GMM and VQ are used for the remaining four recording devices, H01, T01, M01, M02 because except these three classifiers, all other classifiers suffer from singularity problem of covariance matrix in SI. It is observed that VQ provide the highest accuracy for all the devices. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"In response to the overuse of prescription opioid analgesics, clinical practice guidelines encourage opioid deprescribing (ie, dose reduction or cessation) in patients with chronic noncancer pain. Therefore, this study evaluated and compared international clinical guideline recommendations on opioid deprescribing in patients with chronic noncancer pain. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (United Kingdom), and MAGICapp databases from inception to June 4, 2021, with no language or publication restrictions. In addition, we searched the National Guideline Clearinghouse and International Guideline Network databases from inception to December 2018. Two independent reviewers conducted the initial title and abstract screening. After discrepancies were resolved through discussion, 2 independent reviewers conducted the full-text screening of each potentially eligible reference. Four independent reviewers completed the prepiloted, standardized data extraction forms of each included guideline. Extracted information included bibliographical details; strength of recommendations; and the outcomes, such as when and how to deprescribe, managing withdrawal symptoms, additional support, outcome monitoring, and deprescribing with coprescription of sedatives. A narrative synthesis was used to present the results. This study found that clinical practice guidelines agree on when and how to deprescribe opioid analgesics but lack advice on managing a patient's withdrawal symptoms, outcome monitoring, and deprescribing with coprescription of sedatives. Quality assessment of the guidelines suggests that greater discussion on implementation and dissemination is needed. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved."
"Background: Many important clinical decisions require causal knowledge (CK) to take action. Although many causal knowledge bases for medicine have been constructed, a comprehensive evaluation based on real-world data and methods for handling potential knowledge noise are still lacking. Objective: The objectives of our study are threefold: (1) propose a framework for the construction of a large-scale and high-quality causal knowledge graph (CKG); (2) design the methods for knowledge noise reduction to improve the quality of the CKG; (3) evaluate the knowledge completeness and accuracy of the CKG using real-world data. Material and methods: We extracted causal triples from three knowledge sources (SemMedDB, UpToDate and Churchill's Pocketbook of Differential Diagnosis) based on rule methods and language models, performed ontological encoding, and then designed semantic modeling between electronic health record (EHR) data and the CKG to complete knowledge instantiation. We proposed two graph pruning strategies (co-occurrence ratio and causality ratio) to reduce the potential noise introduced by SemMedDB. Finally, the evaluation was carried out by taking the diagnostic decision support (DDS) of diabetic nephropathy (DN) as a real-world case. The data originated from a Chinese hospital EHR system from October 2010 to October 2020. The knowledge completeness and accuracy of the CKG were evaluated based on three state-of-the-art embedding methods (R-GCN, MHGRN and MedPath), the annotated clinical text and the expert review, respectively. Results: This graph included 153,289 concepts and 1,719,968 causal triples. A total of 1427 inpatient data were used for evaluation. Better results were achieved by combining three knowledge sources than using only SemMedDB (three models: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): p < 0.01, F1: p < 0.01), and the graph covered 93.9 % of the causal relations between diseases and diagnostic evidence recorded in clinical text. Causal relations played a vital role in all relations related to disease progression for DDS of DN (three models: AUC: p > 0.05, F1: p > 0.05), and after pruning, the knowledge accuracy of the CKG was significantly improved (three models: AUC: p < 0.01, F1: p < 0.01; expert review: average accuracy: + 5.5 %). Conclusions: The results demonstrated that our proposed CKG could completely and accurately capture the abstract CK under the concrete EHR data, and the pruning strategies could improve the knowledge accuracy of our CKG. The CKG has the potential to be applied to the DDS of diseases. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"Sentiment analysis is one of the effective techniques for mining the opinion from shapeless data contains text like review of the products, review of the movie. Sentiment analysis is used as a key to gather response from consumers, reviews of brands, marketing analyses, and political campaigns. In the subject of natural processing, performing sentiment analysis using the data obtained from Twitter is considered as a new study in these days. The dataset is gathered using the Twitter API and the Twitter package. The analysis of Twitter data is a process which takes place automatically by text data analysis to determine the view of public on the specified topic. Here, an improvised sentimental analysis model is proposed to identify the polarity of the tweets such as positive, neutral and negative. In this paper, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm uses stochastic gradient neural network (SGNN) to categorize the sentiment analysis on basis of tweets provided by the Twitter users and the proposed stochastic gradient descent optimization Algorithm based on stochastic gradient neural network (SGDOA-SGNN) provides better performance when compared with the existing Forest–Whale Optimization Algorithm based on deep neural network F-WOA-DNN model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
"Objective: To determine the skills and intentions of health practitioners in New Zealand to provide first trimester abortion care. New Zealand achieved abortion law reform in 2020, changing how abortion could be delivered and experienced by pregnant people. However, little has changed in the way abortion care is provided. Study design: This survey, which was deployed to a range of health practitioners via regulatory bodies and professional groups, used an online free text and tick box survey. Questions included demographics, scope of practice, abortion care experience, philosophical perspective on abortion, and skills transferable to abortion care. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics and deductive and inductive thematic analysis. Results: 128 respondents included doctors, nurses, midwives, counsellors, and social workers from a range of practice settings, the majority from primary health (51%). Most respondents indicated competency or proficiency in clinical skills relevant to provision of early medical abortion. However, practitioners were more likely to indicate “I do not have this skill” or “support required” for: calculating gestational age by bimanual examination (42%), LARC (implant and IUC) insertion (36%), undertake a pregnancy related consultation using tikanga best practice guidelines (19%). Analysis of qualitative data showed three main themes; (1) support for abortion access and for abortion provision in primary care (2) levels of intention to provide abortion (3) critical components for an action plan for abortion in primary care. Conclusion: Abortion care in the community has support from health practitioners. They identified needs including development of clinical skills, funding, and wider sector support. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Optical character recognition (OCR) is typically used to extract the textual contents of scanned texts. The output of OCR can be noisy, especially when the quality of the scanned image is poor, which in turn can impact downstream tasks such as information retrieval (IR). Post-processing OCR-ed documents is an alternative to fix digitization errors and, intuitively, improve the results of downstream tasks. This work evaluates the impact of OCR digitization and correction on IR. We compared different digitization and correction methods on real OCR-ed data from an IR test collection with 22k documents and 34 query topics on the geoscientific domain in Portuguese. Our results have shown significant differences in IR metrics for the different digitization methods (up to 5 percentage points in terms of mean average precision). Regarding the impact of error correction, our results showed that on the average for the complete set of query topics, retrieval quality metrics change very little. However, a more detailed analysis revealed it improved 19 out of 34 query topics. Our findings indicate that, contrary to previous work, long documents are impacted by OCR errors. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"E-commerce has become a booming market for wildlife trafficking, as online platforms are increasingly more accessible and easier to navigate by sellers, while still lacking adequate supervision. Artificial intelligence models, and specifically deep learning, have been emerging as promising tools for the automated analysis and monitoring of digital online content pertaining to wildlife trade. Here, we used and fine-tuned freely available artificial intelligence models (i.e., convolutional neural networks) to understand the potential of these models to identify instances of wildlife trade. We specifically focused on pangolin species, which are among the most trafficked mammals globally and receiving increasing trade attention since the COVID-19 pandemic. Our convolutional neural networks were trained using online images (available from iNaturalist, Flickr and Google) displaying both traded and non-traded pangolin settings. The trained models showed great performances, being able to identify over 90 % of potential instances of pangolin trade in the considered imagery dataset. These instances included the showcasing of pangolins in popular marketplaces (e.g., wet markets and cages), and the displaying of commonly traded pangolin parts and derivates (e.g., scales) online. Nevertheless, not all instances of pangolin trade could be identified by our models (e.g., in images with dark colours and shaded areas), leaving space for further research developments. The methodological developments and results from this exploratory study represent an advancement in the monitoring of online wildlife trade. Complementing our approach with other forms of online data, such as text, would be a way forward to deliver more robust monitoring tools for online trafficking. © 2023 The Author(s)"
"Recent multimodal sentiment analysis works focus on establishing sophisticated fusion strategies for better performance. However, a major limitation of these works is that they ignore effective modality representation learning before fusion. In this work, we propose a novel text-audio sentiment analysis framework, named StyleBERT, to enhance the emotional information of unimodal representations by learning distinct modality styles, such that the model already obtains an effective unimodal representation before fusion, which mitigates the reliance on fusion. In particular, we propose a Bi-directional Style Enhancement module, which learns one contextualized style representation and two differentiated style representations for each modality, where the relevant semantic information across modalities and the discriminative characteristics of each modality will be captured. Furthermore, to learn fine-grained acoustic representation, we only use the directly available Log-Mel spectrograms as audio modality inputs and encode it with a multi-head self-attention mechanism. Comprehensive experimental results on three widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed StyleBERT is an effective multimodal framework and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art multimodal baselines.

"Background Within the scope of an educational improvement project, the teaching concept of the course hygiene and microbiology at the Goethe-University in Frankfurt was transferred from an organ system-based teaching concept into a case-based teaching concept. Concomitantly, this transformation was qualitatively reviewed to evaluate self-perceived learning success. Methods 54 participants were included in this qualitative study. 45 students were interviewed in homogeneous focus groups of up to five. Nine physicians were interviewed individually. Following anonymization and transcription, a structured and qualitative text analysis was conducted. Results Both groups, students and physicians, prefer a case-based teaching concept in hygiene and microbiology, especially in combination with a hands-on approach to learn practical skills. Students taught with the case-based approach were more satisfied and reported better knowledge retention. The practical elements of the course hygiene and microbiology were positively remembered by all participants. Regardless of the teaching concept, the individual lecturer is considered most essential in shaping motivation. Conclusions Overall, the implementation of a case-based teaching concept with practical elements in the course hygiene and microbiology increases the ability of medical students to understand the relevance of core knowledge and improves self-perceived learning. The fusion of theoretical and clinical contents elements in the course hygiene and microbiology meets the new national medical licensing regulations in Germany and promises to be a sustainable concept for clinical-theoretical subjects like hygiene and microbiology. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

"This article is focused on the statistical data and analyses of 187 Chinese character variants found in the book Chư phẩm kinh (諸品經, Various Essential Segments of the Scripture), which was collected and compiled by Zen Master Pháp Loa (1284–1330) and revised then by Zen Master Huyền Quang (1254–1334) to be handed down for posterity. Of those Chinese character variants, we have analysed 96 that are found only in Vietnam, proving that the number of character variants created intra-nationally in Vietnam is greater than that of the international variants introduced from China. © 2022 The Author(s)."
"Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) has contributed significantly to the monitoring of drug use and transmission of viruses that has been published in numerous research papers. In this paper, we used LitStraw, a self-developed text extraction tool, to extract, analyze, and construct knowledge graphs from nearly 900 related papers in PDF format collected in Web of Science from 2000 to 2021 to analyze the research hotspots and development trends of WBE. The results showed a growing number of WBE publications in multidisciplinary cross-collaboration, with more publications and close collaboration between the USA, Australia, China, and European countries. The keywords of illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals still maintain research hotness, but the specific research hotspots change significantly, among which the research hotspots of new psychoactive substances, biomarkers, and stability show an increasing trend. In addition, judging the spread of COVID-19 by the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in sewage has become the focus since 2020. This work can show the development of WBE more clearly by constructing a knowledge graph and also provide new ideas for the paper mining analysis methods in different fields. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Background: The number of days between treatment sessions is often overlooked as a predictor of attrition in psychotherapy. In text-based Internet interventions, days between sessions may be a simple yet powerful predictor of attrition. Objective: We hypothesized that a larger number of days between sessions increased the likelihood of attrition among participants with Binge Eating Disorder (BED) in a 12-session Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) program. Participants could work on the sessions whenever convenient for them and received written support from a psychologist. Material and methods: We compared 201 adult participants with mild to moderate BED (85 non-completers and 116 completers) on the number of days between sessions to predict attrition rates. Results: Mixed model binomial logistic regression showed that non-completers spent significantly more days between sessions across the first four treatment sessions (1–4) when controlling for age, gender, and intake measures of BMI, BED, overall health status (EQ VAS), and depression symptoms (MDI) (OR = 1.042, p <.001). Age (OR = 0.976, p <.001) and EQ VAS (OR = 0.984, p <.001) were also significant. The risk of attrition increased by 4.2 % for each additional day participants spent completing a session. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that classification accuracy increased across sessions from 61.1 % in session 1 and 65.7 % in session 2 to 68.8 % in session 3 and 73.2 % in session 4. The optimal cut-off point in session 4 was 17.5 days, which detected 60.4 % of non-completers (sensitivity) and 78.4 % of completers (specificity). An exploratory repeated measures of ANOVA of days between sessions showed a significant within-subjects effect, where both non-completers and completers spent more days between sessions as they progressed from sessions 1 through 4 (F = 20.54, df = 3, p <.001). There was no interaction effect, suggesting that the increase in slope did not differ between non-completers and completers. Conclusions: Participants spending more days between sessions are at increased risk of dropping out of treatment. This may have important implications for identifying measures to reduce attrition, e.g., intensifying interventions through automated reminders or therapist messages. Our findings may have important transdiagnostic implications for text-based Internet interventions. Further studies should investigate the predictive value of days between sessions in other diagnoses. © 2023"
"GaN-based electronics have witnessed an increase in both research and industrial activities, first spurred by the successful demonstration of GaN LEDs, and are now expanding into transistors and photovoltaic cells. In addition, GaN/GaAs heterojunction devices are currently receiving much interest. In this study, we conduct rigorous optoelectronic computational analysis of cubic phase GaN (c-GaN)/GaAs heterojunction solar cells for a comprehensive understanding of the cell. We utilize a compositionally graded GaAs1-xNx buffer layer to reduce defect states at the heterojunction interface caused by a significant lattice mismatch between c-GaN and GaAs. Furthermore, we enhance the performance of the cell by optimizing GaAs absorber layer thickness and c-GaN buffer layer doping concentration. Moreover, we examine the effects of GaAs1-xNx/GaAs interface recombination velocity (IRV) on the cell. Overall, we achieve 23% power conversion efficiency within 1.25- μ thin-film GaAs at low GaAs1-xNx/GaAs IRV. The analyses and results presented in this study demonstrate the vast application potential of c-GaN/GaAs heterojunction in high-efficiency solar cells.  © 1963-2012 IEEE."
"Pali Samas words cannot be found in any dictionary. They are created by placing Pali words that contain meaning after one another without changing their morphemes or with changes in morphemes and pronunciation. Thus, Pali Samas words need to be segmented back into their previously original words to obtain their meanings. This research presents a novel approach to Pali Samas segmentation using bidirectional long short-term memory to predict the splitting locations and applies the rules obtained from Samas word segmentation to achieving correct meanings. For the dataset used in this research, a total of 2,757 Thai Pali Samas words are used to further create 4,478 Samas words through text augmentation. The results from the Samas word segmentation indicate that the prediction for splitting locations has a weighted average of F1-score of 99.20%, with 81.91% of the original words derived from reverse segmentation based on the rules.

"Autocommunication, communication with oneself, may become distinct from communication with an ""other""both in form and function. Autocommunication has a special role in the development of thinking in small children, as differentiation of speech for oneself, known as ""private speech,""from communication for social purposes entails the child's organization of her or his own cognition and behavior with the aid of symbols. Recent studies have suggested that speech distinctly for the child him or herself is particularly observable during what is called ""crib speech""and thus it appears to support already early language acquisition. The purpose and functions of crib speech in child development have been topics of interest until recently, but they are still debated. In autocommunication, instead of transfer of signs from one mind to another as when in communication with an ""other,""there is transfer of signs from one state of mind to another, as in the case of recalling something with the help of signs. Next to this mnemonic type autocommunication, Juri Lotman was interested in the type in which textual devices within a text guide the communicative interpretation in relation to the text itself, particularly characteristic to poetry. The paper provides a semiotic analysis of crib speech in terms of Lotman's concept of autocommunication explaining its particular appearance both in form and content, as well as what initiates and inspires it for the small child and why does it bring such joy. From the point of view of semiotics, crib speech presents as an exceptionally rich phenomenon. In addition to being small children's language practice, crib speech appears as language play, if not poetry, serving as a modelling system for enacting and representing the world as it appears for the small child.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) has become part of our everyday lives, and its presence and influence are expected to grow exponentially. Regardless of its expanding impact, the perplexing algorithms and processes that drive AI's decision and output can lead to decreased trust, and thus impede the adoption of future AI services. Explainable AI (XAI) in recommender systems has surfaced as a solution that can help users understand how and why an AI recommended a specific product or service. However, there is no standardized explanation method that satisfies users' preferences and needs. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to explore a unified explanation method that centers around human perspective. This study examines the preference for AI interfaces by investigating the components of user-centered explainability, including scope (global and local) and format (text and visualization). A mixed logit model is used to analyze data collected by a conjoint survey. Results show that local explanation and visualization are preferred, and users dislike lengthy textual interfaces. Our findings incorporate the extraction of monetary value from each attribute. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"Assessing health outcomes associated with exposure to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is important given their persistent and ubiquitous nature. PCBs are classified as a Group 1 carcinogen, but the full range of potential noncancer health effects from exposure to PCBs has not been systematically summarized and evaluated. We used systematic review methods to identify and screen the literature using combined manual review and machine learning approaches. A protocol was developed that describes the literature search strategy and Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria used to facilitate subsequent screening and categorization of literature into a systematic evidence map of PCB exposure and noncancer health endpoints across 15 organs/systems. A comprehensive literature search yielded 62,599 records. After electronic prioritization steps, 17,037 studies were manually screened at the title and abstract level. An additional 900 studies identified by experts or supplemental searches were also included. After full-text screening of 3889 references, 1586 studies met the PECO criteria. Relevant study details such as the endpoints assessed, exposure duration, and species were extracted into literature summary tables. This review compiles and organizes the human and mammalian studies from these tables into an evidence map for noncancer health endpoints and PCB mixture exposure to identify areas of robust research as well as areas of uncertainty that would benefit from future investigation. Summary data are available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. Sufficient research is available to inform PCB hazard assessments for most organs/systems, but the amount of data to inform associations with specific endpoints differs. Furthermore, despite many years of research, sparse data exist for inhalation and dermal exposures, which are highly relevant human exposure routes. This evidence map provides a foundation for future systematic reviews and noncancer hazard assessments of PCB mixtures and for strategic planning of research to inform areas of greater uncertainty. © 2023"
"Background: Pleural infection represents a significant clinical challenge worldwide. Although prompt drainage of pleural fluid is thought to play a key role in pleural infection management, the optimal size of intrapleural catheter has yet to be defined. Objectives: The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize data on efficacy and complications of small-bore drain (SBD), defined as ≤14F, in comparison to large-bore drain (LBD) in patients with pleural infection. Method: We searched MEDLINE and Embase for all studies reporting outcomes of interest published up to October 2021. Two authors reviewed selected full text to identify studies according to predefined eligibility criteria. Summary estimates were derived using the random-effects model. Results: Twelve original studies were included for qualitative analysis and 7 of these for quantitative analysis. The surgical referral rate of SBD and LBD were, respectively, 0.16 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.21) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.10-0.32), the pooled mortality were 0.12 (95% CI, 0.05-0.21) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.10-0.32), and the length of hospital stay was 24 days in both groups. Data on complications suggest similar proportions of tube dislodgement. Intensity of pain was evaluated in one study only, reporting higher scores for LBD. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis provide the first synthesis of data on performance of SBD and LBD in management of pleural infection, and, overall, clinical outcomes and complications did not substantially differ, although the limited number of studies and the absence of dedicated randomized trials does limit the reliability of results. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Objective: To explore midwives’ thoughts on providing antenatal care to pregnant transmen. Methods: A qualitative study based on semi-structured, individual interviews with 12 midwives during January 2022. Systematic text condensation was used for data analysis. Results: The analysis of the data material resulted in three result categories: 1) Gender transition and the desire to have children - exposure of the phenomenon can help to avoid stigmatisation, 2) A pregnant person is a pregnant person no matter what - the midwife's role in meeting a pregnant man, and 3) Being a man but using the body as a woman - the knowledge is lacking in the textbooks. Conclusion: The study showed that midwives have little knowledge about pregnant transmen. The knowledge gaps will remain unfilled unless more research is done on the topic, and sufficient information provides for good procedures and standards of care. Access to information about pregnant transmen and experiences of their encounters with midwives will contribute with new knowledge and over time, changes in attitudes, both professional and private. © 2023 The Author(s)"
"Research examining workplace bullying (WB) perpetration from the perspective of perpetrators has remained limited compared to the literature on targets and victims. Until now, no systematic review of the studies from the perpetrators' viewpoints has been published. The present review aimed to synthesize the empirical studies that examine antecedents, mediators, moderators, and outcomes of WB perpetration. It also analyzed the practical suggestions given to curb perpetration and the research methods used. A literature search in Scopus, ProQuest, Science Direct, PubMed, and Web of Science databases for empirical studies published between 2003 and 2023 in peer-reviewed journals in English resulted in 50 full-text articles. Antecedent–perpetration relationships were primarily examined based on social and aggression theories. These relationships were analyzed in the silos of work environment or individual factors without diverse moderators and mediators. Research on WB perpetrators largely lacked causality analysis. Perpetration was associated with task-focused, conflict-prone, poorly organized, and stressful work environments. WB perpetrators had undesirable personality characteristics, and they were also being bullied. The outcomes of their behavior were rarely studied. The suggestions the researchers gave to curb WB perpetration seemed unlikely to be implemented by the same management team that created the toxic environment in the first place. Research on WB perpetrators, which is still in its infancy stage, lacks variety in terms of topics studied, the combination of work environment and individual factors, causality analysis and evidence-based interventions. © 2023 The Authors"
"Because of the environmental consequences of manufacturing activities, the general public, industry, and academia are becoming more aware of sustainable manufacturing (SM), which incorporates environmentally friendly manufacturing processes while emphasizing overall triple bottom line (TBL) performance in manufacturing. This article employs various text mining techniques and bibliometric analysis including cluster analysis, Pearson coefficient and research landscape to conduct an extensive investigation on SM with a focus on the TBL, in which the research content of SM with the TBL is reviewed and discussed systematically from a wide angle and with reduced bias. In this study, three new indicators about the ratios of the number of scientific papers between social, environmental, and economic dimensions of SM are devised to show the weight and level of importance of dimensions in SM, covering scientific papers from 30 years. The findings from this study indicate that the influential power of SM varies across the three dimensions, with a particular emphasis on the social dimension of SM from various countries, implying a current state of imbalance status in TBL for SM, at the same time, the economic and environmental dimensions share similar research topics and academic emphasis in SM. Based on these findings, recommendations based on sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN) are made to increase the social influence of SM. This article firstly reveals the individual status of the social dimension and the situation of unbalanced TBL in SM, providing sustainable suggestions for enhancing the effectiveness of SM and achieving balanced TBL regarding the SDGs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"The present work reports a novel methodological and comprehensive bibliometric analysis on past and present research advances carried out on geothermal water–rock interaction experiments from 1963 to 2022. The novel bibliometric analysis enabled the most representative bibliometric indicators on the research subject to be obtained. Published articles, preferred publication journals, research leaderships (authors, networking groups, institutions, and countries), and future research trends were also collected from a comprehensive searching carried out in indexed databases (Web of Science and Scopus). Up to our knowledge, this bibliometric information will benefit the worldwide geothermal community by providing a deeper insight of water/rock interaction lab experiments carried out up to date. The bibliometric analysis suggests relevant research areas such as geochemistry, thermodynamics, enhanced geothermal systems, carbon dioxide capture, and hydrothermal alteration as the main key research findings. These research areas were identified as the main bibliometric hotspots which have a strong potential to be used for the experimental design of new and improved water–rock interaction studies to address some crucial problems present in the geothermal prospection and exploitation. Among these problems stand out the study of hydrothermal, superhot and enhanced geothermal systems, the chemical fractionation of major and trace elements, the hydrothermal alteration, the calibration of solute and gas geothermometers, the scaling and corrosion problems, the carbon capture and storage, the evaluation of environmental issues, among others. Details of this comprehensive bibliometric analysis, including some statistical and text mining and mapping tools are fully outlined. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Background: The ability to effectively communicate with patients continues to be a challenge for physician offices. Mobile healthcare applications have enhanced the accessibility of healthcare providers to their patients. However, the efficacy of unrestricted, personalized, bidirectional, freeform texting has not been previously evaluated. Methods: We investigated patient preference and self-reported outcomes using a smartphone HIPAA compliant mobile healthcare texting app, compared to conventional telecommunication, in self-reported quality of care, and impact on preventing unnecessary emergency department visits. A retrospective cohort survey study of a single-surgeon hernia specialist’s practice was utilized. Patients with access to a smartphone who received care between July 2017 and March 2020 were instructed to utilize the healthcare texting app as a replacement to calling/receiving calls from the physician’s office. Messages to and from patients were delivered directly to their surgeon and the surgical team via non-automated, personalized, freeform text messages, and templates, available to patients at all hours of the day. A depersonalized online survey was then distributed to assess patient perceived quality of care using the app, compared to their past experiences calling physician offices, and whether they preferred using text or conventional telecommunication. Additional statistics were reported using the application’s built-in software, including response times, adoption rates, and message volumes. Results: 90 patients successfully completed the entirety of the survey, median age range 50–60 years old. 97% of respondents reported the texting app provided at least non-inferior quality of care compared to conventional telecommunication, with a majority (75%) experiencing a relatively improved quality of care. 9% reported an unnecessary ED visit being avoided after consulting their physician through the application. Conclusions: Unrestricted, freeform, non-automated communication via texting may be preferred by patients over conventional telecommunication. However, further research is warranted to assess the external validity and clinical impact of such results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of different physical therapy interventions that could validate decisions taken by health care providers in the field of rehabilitation of patients with hemophilia according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), including body functions and structures, activity, and participation. Data Sources: Seven databases—PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Web of Science, Physiotherapy Evidence Database, Google Scholar, and Clinicaltrials.gov—were systematically searched for randomized controlled trials evaluating any physical therapy modality to manage hemophilia. Study Selection: After abstract and full-text filtration, a methodological quality assessment was performed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale for the studies that met the eligibility criteria. Data Extraction: Relevant data were extracted from eligible studies and outcomes were categorized according to the ICF. Data Synthesis: Using Review Manager and Microsoft Excel, a quantitative analysis using standardized mean differences with the 95% confidence interval was completed. Statistical heterogeneity between studies was explored using the I2 test. A fixed effect model was applied to all data analyses. If heterogeneity was statistically significant, the Der Simonian and Laird random effects models were used instead. Results: 35 randomized controlled trials with 1216 participants were included in this systematic review; 13 of them dealt with pediatric patients. Most of the studies were of good quality; 12 studies were of low quality. Meta-analysis showed a significant difference in favor of manual therapy, laser, and therapeutic exercises on selected outcomes of body function and structure, activity, and participation categories of the ICF model. Conclusion: This systematic review recommends using manual therapy and therapeutic exercise modalities to improve join health status in combination with educational sessions to improve the quality of life of patients with hemophilic arthropathy. For pediatric patients with hemophilic arthropathy, using laser therapy is promising for improving functional capacity. © 2022 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine"
"Objectives: This study aimed to systematically review the literature to determine outcomes following surgical treatment of pediatric vocal fold nodules. Methods: Studies with patients ≤18 years with nodules who underwent surgery were reviewed for dysphonia improvement and recurrence in PubMed, EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, Cochrane, Scopus, and Web of Science databases, searched from inception to November 1, 2022 using PRISMA guidelines. Non-English studies and case reports were excluded. Two evaluators independently reviewed each abstract and article. Heterogeneity and bias across studies were evaluated and meta-analysis was performed. Results: The literature search yielded 655 articles; 145 underwent full-text screening and eight were selected for systematic review and meta-analysis. There were 311 children with nodules, aged 2–18 years, with male-to-female ratio of 3.6:1. There were no surgical complications. Voice therapy was inconsistently reported. Follow-up time ranged from 1 month to 10 years. One study concluded that neither surgery nor voice therapy was effective, while five studies concluded that dysphonia improved with surgery. Voice grading by GRBAS, objective voice measures, and lesion size were improved following surgery, when reported. Meta-analysis of six studies demonstrated improvement in dysphonia in 90% of children post-operatively (95% CI: 74–99%). Meta-analysis of four studies showed that recurrence occurred in 19% of children (95% CI: 13–23%). Conclusion: This systematic review suggests possible post-operative improvement in dysphonia for pediatric patients with vocal fold nodules; however, study measures, methods, and surgery utilized were heterogeneous and results should be interpreted cautiously. In order to better understand surgical outcomes, future studies should include standardized definition of nodules and objective measures of voice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."
"Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a global demand for intelligent health surveillance and diagnosis systems for patients with critical conditions, particularly those with severe heart diseases. Sophisticated measurement tools are used in hospitals worldwide to identify serious heart conditions. However, these tools need the face-to-face involvement of healthcare experts to identify cardiac problems. Objective: To design and implement an intelligent health monitoring and diagnosis system for critical cardiac arrhythmia COVID-19 patients. Methodology: We use artificial intelligence tools divided into two parts: (i) IoT-based health monitoring; and (ii) fuzzy logic-based medical diagnosis. The intelligent diagnosis of heart conditions and IoT-based health surveillance by doctors is offered to critical COVID-19 patients or isolated in remote locations. Sensors, cloud storage, as well as a global system for mobile texts and emails for communication with doctors in case of emergency are employed in our proposal. Results: Our implemented system favors remote areas and isolated critical patients. This system utilizes an intelligent algorithm that employs an ECG signal pre-processed by moving through six digital filters. Then, based on the processed results, features are computed and assessed. The intelligent fuzzy system can make an autonomous diagnosis and has enough information to avoid human intervention. The algorithm is trained using ECG data from the MIT-BIH database and achieves high accuracy. In real-time validation, the fuzzy algorithm obtained almost 100% accuracy for all experiments. Conclusion: Our intelligent system can be helpful in many situations, but it is particularly beneficial for isolated COVID-19 patients who have critical heart arrhythmia and must receive intensive care. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"Objectives: To compare online learning with traditional face-to-face and blended learning, based on randomized controlled trials, to determine the impact of online learning on nursing students' learning outcomes. Design: A systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources: A systematic search was conducted via English (PubMed, ERIC, Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL) and Korean databases (RISS, DBpia, and KISS). Review methods: Studies published up to the first week of April 2022 were reviewed with a focus on the participants, intervention, comparison, outcome, and study design format. Following a primary screening of titles and abstracts, and secondary screening of full texts, 10 randomized controlled trial studies were selected, of which eight were included in the meta-analysis. Two researchers independently reviewed the literature, and the final selection was made in consensus. Results: Online learning had a statistically significant positive effect on nursing students' knowledge, compared with no educational intervention (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 1.63; 95 % confidence interval (CI): 1.31 to 1.95). However, there was no significant difference in the impact of online learning on knowledge compared with blended learning (SMD = −0.14; 95 % CI: −0.70 to 0.41) and face-to-face learning (SMD = 0.37; 95 % CI: −0.32 to 1.06). Furthermore, compared with blended learning (SMD = −0.18; 95 % CI: −0.43 to 0.06) and face-to-face learning (SMD = 0.05; 95 % CI: −0.31 to 0.41), there was no significant difference in the impact of online learning on attitudes toward learning. Conclusions: Online learning in nursing education is not significantly different from blended or face-to-face learning in terms of its impact on knowledge acquisition and attitudes toward learning. The results of this review and meta-analysis highlight the need for selective application of learning methods, taking into account learning environments as well as curricular subjects and topics. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was purposively distributed to pharmacy staff in England before accessing an optional suicide awareness raising video, hosted by Centre for Pharmacy Postgraduate Education (CPPE), in September 2019–March 2021. Questions included demographics and experience of, attitudes towards, and preparedness for, suicide prevention. The 14-item Attitudes to Suicide Prevention (ASP) scale was used (possible range 14–70 with lower scores representing positive attitudes). Descriptive and comparative statistics were reported. Free-text comments were invited to explore respondents’ experience of suicide prevention and reflexive thematic analysis used. Results: Of 403 respondents, 82% were female; most were pharmacists (59%) or pharmacy technicians (21%), with the remainder having other roles. Eighty-five percent worked in community pharmacy. Eleven percent had prior suicide prevention training, and 71% reported interacting with at least one patient about suicide. Most often, suicidality was disclosed by the patient (40%), with 6% of pharmacy staff having directly asked a patient about suicidal behavior or plans. The aggregated ASP score was 31.51 (SD 6.23), and role did not affect experience or attitude. Pharmacy teams’ experiences of suicide prevention can be summarized by three major themes i) Exposure to suicide; ii) Responsibility for action; and iii) Access to means of suicide. Conclusions: Pharmacy teams felt responsibility in caring for those at risk of suicide and had experience of this. Further training should include understanding of medicines means restriction and involve all roles and sectors of pharmacy. Pharmacy teams should be integrated into the ‘circle of care’ to access referral pathways. © 2022 The Authors"
"Classics has been used for various social, cultural and political purposes on the African sub-continent. Part I highlights some theoretical considerations regarding the traditional models of the classical tradition and the classical reception in Africa. The idea of the classical ‘traception’ embraces the classical tradition through its suggestion of linear descendent and the classical reception through its ‘receptive’ and reconfigurative associations. Part II discusses how and when classical ideas and texts reached and extended into Africa from the time of the sixteenth century and the main areas that constitute the classical ‘traception’ on the subcontinent. Part III presents a case study in the area of drama to illustrate some of the interpretive consequences of using the model of the classical tradition as opposed to that of the classical reception. My proposed model of the ‘classical traception’ seems preferable to either of these models when describing the dynamics of Fugard, Kani, and Ntshona’s The Island (1974) since it spans both the European conception of the original Antigone and its linear descent as well as its reconfiguration by its split collective (hybrid) multi-racial ‘author’ in The Island. Considering the elements of the classical tradition along with those of the classical reception—what I jointly term classical ‘traception’—helps to provide a broader view of the ways in which Classics has helped to shape and been received by different African societies and their cultures from the perspectives of both the European colonizers and indigenous peoples. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Rapid urbanization negatively affects the built and biotic environment, necessitating interdisciplinary mitigation strategies. Current nature-based solutions that are integrated into building envelope design have proved to be beneficial. These solutions, however, are primarily anthropocentric and often overlook the potential to support other living organisms, such as animals and microbiota. Thus, a multi-species approach is envisioned to facilitate more holistic envelope-design solutions. While integrating ecological knowledge into architectural design often introduces decision-making complexity, multi-criteria decision-making can support multi-species building envelope design. This paper reviews such decision-making applications in two domains: building envelope design and ecological planning design. Using a systematic literature review methodology to compile relevant publications for full-text analysis, the results show significant disparities between the two domains. This is primarily driven by decision-making applications, the scale of analysis, criteria typology and external decision-maker engagement. However, we identified opportunities to sequentially employ multi-objective optimization and multi-attribute decision-making to mitigate the technical differences and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration. Finally, we discuss future developments using hybrid multi-criteria decision-making to facilitate better architectural and ecological computer-aided design. © 2023 The Authors"
"The distraction of road users is one of the leading causes of road crashes. In general, distraction in road crashes is often associated with only driving, not walking, however, several studies have highlighted distracted walking as a major cause for road crashes and have also examined distracted walking behaviour and its causes, but there is a paucity of such kind of literature in the context of developing or low-income countries, such as India. This study sought to fill this gap by examining factors that influence pedestrians' use of cell phones for texting while crossing the roads in the city of Bhopal, India. In the present study analysis of psychological factors and socio-economic factors that contribute to distracted walking/crossing was analysed using an extended version of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modelling (SEM), this study confirmed the validity of items under each factor of the TPB and then employed SEM to investigate the relationship between the latent variables (attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behaviour control), and demographic characteristics (age, income, and gender) of pedestrians with their intention to text while crossing the street. The results obtained from SEM indicated that the intention to use cell phones for texting at crosswalks was negatively impacted by age, and positively impacted by income level. A significant influence of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behaviour control was found on the intention to use cell phones. Perceived behaviour control (PBC) was found as the most influential factor for predicting pedestrian intentions to use cell phones, followed by Subjective norms (SN). In addition, perceived behaviour control and the intention to use a cell phone also significantly affected crossing behaviour. The findings from the present study can significantly contribute to enhancing pedestrian safety in transportation research, and a better understanding of the factors contributing to pedestrian fatalities could lead towards safe system approach. © 2023 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences"
"With an increase in complexity and severity, it is becoming harder to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities. Although traditional tools remain useful, machine learning models are being adopted to expand efforts. To help explore methods of vulnerability detection, we present an empirical study on the effectiveness of text-based machine learning models by utilizing 344 open-source projects, 2,182 vulnerabilities and 38 vulnerability types. With the availability of vulnerabilities being presented in forms such as code snippets, we construct a methodology based on extracted source code functions and create equal pairings. We conduct experiments using seven machine learning models, five natural language processing techniques and three data processing methods. First, we present results based on full context function pairings. Next, we introduce condensed functions and conduct a statistical analysis to determine if there is a significant difference between the models, techniques, or methods. Based on these results, we answer research questions regarding model prediction for testing within and across projects and vulnerability types. Our results show that condensed functions with fewer features may achieve greater prediction results when testing within rather than across. Overall, we conclude that text-based machine learning models are not effective in detecting vulnerabilities within or across projects and vulnerability types. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"This paper reports on an automated patent landscaping and legal geography analysis to scrutinize the biopiracy of endemic plants in the island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic). My analysis relies on shrubs and flowers that may be reaped without a fair and equitable distribution of benefits. My findings highlight that Western pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies' innovations may overlap sovereign states’ intellectual property rights, implying that regulatory gaps must be filled to empower local communities to benefit from biodiversity and ecosystem services. Therefore, I suggest that the island adopt effective and consistent access and benefit-sharing policies, including mechanisms that encourage environmental protection and require prior informed consent and mutually agreed terms for utilizing genetic resources. I also suggest the introduction of disclosure of origin and/or source of genetic resources in their respective patents regime to ensure that Convention on Biological Diversity regulations and other related international frameworks can be followed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"The practice of municipal solid waste (MSW) in developing countries like China is changing from mixed treatment to classified treatment, with the need of urban development. This variation calls for assessment of the MSW policies, in particular, whether the MSW policies formulated in the past can well guide the demand of the current MSW system. Quantitative evaluation of MSW policies from the perspective of policy consistency is conducive to systematically identifying common problems existing in policies and providing possible new ways for policy improvement. However, quantitative evaluation of MSW policies is under-represented in the existing literature. This paper employs the Policy Modeling Consistency Index (PMC-Index) approach and text mining technology to quantitatively evaluate the consistency level of China's 26 MSW policies, and comparatively analyze the common problems of 26 policies in the horizontal dimensions. The results indicate that sixteen policies belong to the good consistency level, ten pertain to the acceptable level. In other words, none is able to attain the perfect policy level. This demonstrates that while China's MSW policies are generally reasonable and consistent, there is some room for improvement. Further comparative analysis reveals that policy release agency, policy timeliness and policy instrument are main reasons for the results of policy imperfection. Thus, these three aspects may be the starting points to effectively improve China's MSW policies. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the primary cause of anovulatory infertility, bringing serious harm to women's physical and mental health. Acupuncture may be an effective treatment for PCOS. However, systematic reviews (SRs) on the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for PCOS have reported inconsistent results, and the quality of these studies has not been adequately assessed. Objective: To summarize and evaluate the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of acupuncture for PCOS, as well as to assess the quality and risks of bias of the available SRs. Search strategy: Nine electronic databases (Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, and China Biology Medicine disc) were searched from their establishment to July 27, 2022. Based on the principle of combining subject words with text words, the search strategy was constructed around search terms for “acupuncture,” “polycystic ovary syndrome,” and “systematic review.” Inclusion criteria: SRs of randomized controlled trials that explored the efficacy and (or) safety of acupuncture for treating patients with PCOS were included. Data extraction and analysis: Two authors independently extracted study data according to a predesigned form. Tools for evaluating the methodological quality, risk of bias, reporting quality, and confidence in study outcomes, including A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR 2), Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS), Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses for Acupuncture (PRISMA-A), and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE), were used to score the included SRs. Results: A total of 885 studies were retrieved, and 11 eligible SRs were finally included in this review. The methodological quality of 2 SRs (18.18%) was low, while the other 9 SRs (81.82%) were scored as extremely low. Four SRs (36.36%) were considered to be of low risk of bias. As for reporting quality, the reporting completeness of 9 SRs (81.82%) was more than 70%. Concerning the confidence in study results, 2 study results were considered to have a high quality of evidence (3.13%), 14 (21.88%) a “moderate” quality, 28 (43.75%) a “low” quality, and 20 (31.24%) considered a “very low” quality. Descriptive analyses suggested that combining acupuncture with other medicines can effectively improve the clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) and ovulation rate, and reduce luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and body mass index (BMI). When compared with medicine alone, acupuncture alone also can improve CPR. Further, when compared with no intervention, acupuncture had a better effect in promoting the recovery of menstrual cycle and reducing BMI. Acupuncture was reported to cause no adverse events or some adverse events without serious harm. Conclusion: The efficacy and safety of acupuncture for PCOS remains uncertain due to the limitations and inconsistencies of current evidence. More high-quality studies are needed to support the use of acupuncture in PCOS. © 2022 Shanghai Yueyang Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine."
"Objective: Little is known about sex differences in response to lifestyle interventions among pediatric populations. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate sex differences in adiposity following lifestyle interventions among children and adolescents with overweight or obesity aged 6 to 18 years old. Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE (from inception to March 2021), and references from included articles were examined. Eligibility criteria included children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years with overweight or obesity, randomization to a lifestyle intervention versus a control group, and assessment of at least one adiposity measure. Corresponding authors were contacted to obtain summary statistics by sex (n = 14/49). Results: Of 89 full-text articles reviewed, 49 (55%) were included, of which 33 (67%) reported statistically significant intervention effects on adiposity. Only two studies (4%) evaluated sex differences in response to lifestyle intervention, reporting conflicting results. The results of the meta-regression models demonstrated no significant differences in the treatment effect between male and female youth for weight (beta = −0.05, SE = 0.18, z = −0.28, p = 0.8), BMI (beta = 0.03, SE = 0.14, z = 0.19, p = 0.85), BMI z score (beta = −0.04, SE = 0.18, z = −0.23, p = 0.82), percentage body fat (beta = −0.11, SE = 0.16, z = −0.67, p = 0.51), and waist circumference (beta = −0.30, SE = 0.25, z = −1.18, p = 0.24). Conclusions: The meta-analysis revealed that youth with overweight or obesity do not demonstrate a differential response to lifestyle intervention in relation to adiposity-related outcomes. © 2023 The Obesity Society."
"Aim: Qualitative Phenomenological analysis of nurses' experience working with immigrants, exploring the dimension of work motivation. Background: Nurses' professional motivation and job satisfaction affects quality of care, work performance, burnout and resilience. The challenge of maintaining professional motivation is reinforced when providing care to refugees and new immigrants. In recent years, a large number of refugees sought sanctuary in Europe, resulting in the formation of refugee camps and asylum centers. Medical staff - including nurses - are involved in patient-caregiver encounter treating multicultural immigrant/refugee population. Design and methodology: A qualitative Phenomenological Methodology was employed. In-depth semi structured interviews and archival research were both used. Results: Study population – 93 certified nurses working between the years 1934–2014. Thematic and text analysis was employed. Four main motivation themes emerged from the interviews: duty, mission, perception of devotion and the general responsibility to bridge the cultural gap for the immigrant patients. Conclusion: The findings emphasize the importance of understanding nurses' motivations in working with immigrants. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"Introduction: More than 25% of American adolescents live in immigrant families. This cohort of adolescents is a minority group with amplified health challenges. The purpose of this study was to provide an integrative review of quantitative research on the access and use of primary and preventive health care by adolescents in immigrant families. Method: Searches yielded 460 reports, 54 of them satisfied criteria for full-text review, and four publications met inclusion criteria. Results: Research, albeit very limited, revealed that adolescents in immigrant families have poor access to and use of preventive health care. Discussion: Lack of primary health care may prevent identification of health risks in immigrant adolescents and lead them to perceive that preventive health care is unnecessary. Researchers are challenged to develop and test health promotion interventions tailored for these adolescents. Study recruitment outside of high schools, the typical setting, is critical to advance knowledge and improve access for this vulnerable population. © The Author(s) 2023."
"This article explores the fan-dubbing practice of ‘abridged anime’ on YouTube and considers the implications involving the creators’ cultural distance from their transnational source material. In this case study, I argue that the practice of parody and fan appropriation can be viewed within the context of global media flows and cultural reinterpretation, suggesting a toxic fan culture that either trivializes or distorts the original text. By focusing on numerous abridged anime series and creator interviews, and framing that analysis within the theorization of parodic transgression, I demonstrate that these fan practices can take on either orientalist or sexist perspectives and move us further from a nuanced cultural understanding of the text itself. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The creation of an engaging online learning environment where students feel a sense of belonging is a challenge for all educators. With the rise of online courses, discussion forums are commonly used to connect students with course content, peers, and instructors. However, these discussions are often text-based in nature. The purpose of this quantitative study examined preservice teacher perceptions of Flipgrid in an introductory educational technology course. Statistically significant relationships between groups were found related to two of the three components of the Community of Inquiry framework. Specifically, the findings suggest those enrolled in a hybrid course perceived Flipgrid as a more effective platform to create cognitive and teaching presence than those online. Additionally, hybrid learners were significantly more likely to use Flipgrid in their own teaching practices. In this article, an analysis of findings will be discussed and provide suggestions for future research. © 2023, Association for Educational Communications & Technology."
"The impact of online social media has aided the users in sharing of knowledge, mood, feelings, and interests to the large volume of audience. The mental health of a person can be easily identified by analysing these expressions consisting of different modalities (text and emojis/emoticons). This research work aims to investigate the mood disorder like depression, low mood and other symptoms using tweets and emoticons. The present work curated the twitter based SentiEmoDD dataset as a benchmark for depression detection, labelled with sentiments analysis, emotions detection and other symptoms important for depression detection. The evolved dataset is equipped with both modalities (text and emojis) of tweets. A novel approach has been proposed based on the multi-view ensemble learning model contemplated to attain the information available in different modalities of a sentence for better depression detection. The proposed approach extracts the results from inter ensemble learning model and intra ensemble learning model. The experimental results clearly indicates that multimodal, multi-view and multitasking proposed framework provides an accuracy of 88.29% for the primary task of depression detection SVM linear kernel function. The stacking technique used here, provides the accuracy of 87.69% to detect depression using the proposed algorithm considering all the expressions of emoji and text combinations. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden."
"A systematic review and Bayesian sequential pair-wise meta-analyses were conducted to assess the efficacy of internal teat sealants (ITS) administered at dry-off in comparison to no treatment for preventing new intramammary infections (IMI) and clinical mastitis (CM) in dairy cattle. This work updated a previous systematic review and network meta-analysis conducted in 2019 but employed a narrowed scope and eligibility. The updated eligibility included studies that used ITS without concurrent therapy compared to a no treatment control (NTC), a study population of dairy cows or prepartum heifers, controlled trial design, and assessed one of the following outcomes: incidence of new IMI at calving or CM during the first 30 days in milk (DIM). Risk of bias was assessed through the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Evidence quality was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). There were 141 potentially relevant records identified from the updated search conducted on April 29, 2021, with a publication date restriction of 2018 or later; one study passed full-text screening and was included. Of the 32 studies included in the previous review, 12 studies were relevant after applying the modified eligibility criteria, totaling 13 studies included in this review (12 addressing IMI at calving outcome, 4 addressing CM at 30 DIM outcome). Sequential meta-analysis was conducted for both outcomes in R 3.6.0. Decisions for stopping were assessed at each analysis for intervention effect or futility in finding an effect based on a priori minimum clinically relevant values (ORδ =0.5, 0.75). ITS at dry-off significantly reduced odds of new IMI at calving compared to NTC at the second meta-analysis (OR2 =0.27, 95% CI=0.22–0.34), and onward (OR12 =0.29, 95% CI=0.27–0.32). For CM at 30 DIM, significance was reached at the second meta-analysis (OR2 =0.59, 95% CI=0.47–0.73), and onward (OR3 =0.47, 95% CI=0.42–0.51). Stopping for effect occurred at the second analysis in both outcomes and ORδs, but low-quality evidence and heterogeneity concerns were noted. A continuity-correction to include zero-event CM studies showed significance at the third meta-analysis (OR3 =0.79, 95% CI=0.73–0.86), stopping for effect at the fourth for ORδ = 0.75 (OR4 =0.77, 95% CI=0.72–0.83), and stopping for futility at the second for ORδ = 0.5 (OR2 =0.94, 95% CI=0.75–1.20), but the main CM analysis was considered more appropriate due to the sensitivity analysis’ very low-quality evidence assessment. Based on sequential evidence available, sufficient research currently exists for practical use, and cessation of future research until substantial changes to ITS application occur may be appropriate. © 2023"
"Background: Peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is widely used in clinical practice because of its long retention time and easy maintenance. However, PICC-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the most serious complication of PICC. Guidelines recommend exercise therapy to prevent PICC-associated VTE. However, inconsistent findings have been reported across the literature. This study conducted a meta-analysis to further evaluate the effect of exercise therapy on PICC-associated VTE. Methods: We searched CNKI, Wanfang database, Chinese Science and Technology Journal Full Text Database, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases and included all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of exercise therapy for the prevention of PICC-associated VTE. Two investigators independently screened the literature, extracted information, and evaluated the risk of bias for eligible RCTs. Meta-analysis was conducted by RevMan5.4 software. Results: Eleven RCTs were included, including 1919 patients. Meta-analysis showed that the incidence of PICC-associated VTE was lower in the exercise therapy group than in the usual care group (RR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.22–0.41, p < 0.00001).Exercise therapy increased the axillary vein maximum velocity (SMD = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.58–1.28, p < 0.00001) and the axillary vein time-mean flow velocity (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.53–1.20, p < 0.00001). Subgroup analysis showed statistically significant differences for the incidence of PICC-associated VTE for intervention times<4 weeks (RR = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.17–0.40, p < 0.00001) and intervention times≥4 weeks (RR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.22–0.54, p < 0.00001). For axillary vein maximum velocity, the difference was statistically significant for both intervention time <4 weeks (SMD = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55–0.91, p < 0.00001) and intervention time ≥4 weeks (SMD = 1.18, 95% CI: 0.18–2.19, p = 0.02). For axillary vein time-mean flow velocity, the intervention time <4 weeks (SMD = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.46–1.04, p < 0.00001), and the difference was statistically significant; while ≥4 weeks, the difference was not statistically significant (SMD = 1.14, 95% CI: −0.07 to 2.35, p = 0.06). Conclusions: Exercise therapy improved venous blood flow velocity and effectively reduced the incidence of PICC-associated VTE. However, RCTs with large samples and high quality are needed to further evaluate the effectiveness of exercise therapy in PICC patients. © The Author(s) 2023."
"At millimeter waves (MMW), the current state of research in computational dosimetry is mainly relying on flat-surface tissue-equivalent models to simplify the exposure assessment by disregarding geometrical irregularities characteristic of conformal surfaces on realistic models. However, this can lead to errors in estimation of dosimetric quantities on non-planar body parts with local curvature radii comparable to the wavelength of the incident field. In this study, we address this problem by developing an averaging technique for the assessment of the absorbed power density (Sab) on the anatomically-accurate electromagnetic (EM) model of the human ear. The dosimetric analysis is performed for the plane-wave exposure at 26 and 60 GHz, and the accuracy of the proposed method is verified by using two commercial EM software. Furthermore, we compare the two definitions of Sab provided in the international guidelines and standards for limiting exposure to EM fields above 6 GHz. Results show marginal relative differences between the obtained values from the two different definitions (within about 6 %) in all considered scenarios. On the other hand, in comparison to flat models, the spatial maximum Sab on the ear is up to about 20 % larger regardless of definition. These findings demonstrate a promising potential of the proposed method for the assessment of Sab on surfaces of anatomical models at frequencies upcoming for the 5th generation (5G) wireless networks and beyond. © 2016 IEEE."
"Purpose: Both women with breast cancer and their minor children were affected by a breast cancer diagnosis. The purpose of this review was to synthesize the evidence from qualitative studies on illness-related communication between mothers with breast cancer and their minor children from mothers’ perspectives. Methods: A thorough systematic review and meta-synthesis of qualitative studies was conducted. English articles published prior to 6 November 2021 were searched from five databases, including PubMed/ MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. After screening the titles, abstracts, and full texts, seven articles were finally included in the quality appraisal and meta-aggregation. Results: Four synthesized findings were derived from seven articles, including disclosure dilemma, factors impacting disclosure, methods of communication, and information needs. Conclusions: This systematic review offered insight into the communication between mothers with breast cancer and their minor children. Various factors influenced the decision-making process on illness-related disclosure, as well as the methods and contents of the communication. Future studies should be undertaken to explore the common model shared by mothers and children who have had comparable experiences, as well as to completely analyze the differences between different cultures in this topic. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

"This paper introduces AutoHTTP, a novel end-to-end trainable framework for detecting malicious HTTP traffic. It can automatically analyze plain-text network traffic data without any manual labor and present an interpretable detection report for better human understanding. The purpose of the framework is to detect malicious HTTP traffic by mining multi-field inexplicit semantic characteristics and correlation. To conquer the problems in reality, we first divide the multi-field plain-texts (e.g. user-agent, URL, method) into two types: R-field and S-field. Then, an elementary feature extraction module is proposed to turn these fields into a compact field representation. Finally, the field interactions and significant parts of different fields are simultaneously extracted by feeding the compact feature vector into a newly proposed attention and cross network, which couples two important components, the attention portion and the cross part. We show that the network offers strong interpretability and reliable results for further analysis. Extensive experiments on CTU-13, CICAndMal, and ISCX-URL datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods based on manually-designed features and other auto-designed features. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Background: Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a devastating disease affecting young adults, resulting in significant pain, articular surface collapse, and disabling dysfunction. ONFH can be divided into two broad categories: traumatic and non-traumatic. It has been established that ONFH results from an inadequate blood supply that causes the death of osteocytes and bone marrow cells. Nonetheless, the precise mechanism of ONFH remains to be elucidated. In this regard, preclinical animal and cell models to study ONFH have been established to assess the efficacy of various modalities for preventing and treating ONFH. Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that many models do not share the same physiologic and metabolic characteristics as humans. Therefore, it is necessary to establish a reproducible model that better mimics human disease. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literatures in regard to ONFH experimental models over the past 30 years. The search was performed in PubMed and Web of Science. Original animal, cell studies with available full-text were included. This review summarizes different methods for developing animal and cell experimental models of ONFH. The advantages, disadvantages and success rates of ONFH models are also discussed. Finally, we provide experimental ONFH model schemes as a reference. Results: According to the recent literatures, animal models of ONFH include traumatic, non-traumatic and traumatic combined with non-traumatic models. Most researchers prefer to use small animals to establish non-traumatic ONFH models. Indeed, small animal-based non-traumatic ONFH modeling can more easily meet ethical requirements with large samples. Otherwise, gradient concentration or a particular concentration of steroids to induce MSCs or EPCs, through which researchers can develop cell models to study ONFH. Conclusions: Glucocorticoids in combination with LPS to induce ONFH animal models, which can guarantee a success rate of more than 60% in large samples. Traumatic vascular deprivation combines with non-traumatic steroids to induce ONFH, obtaining success rates ranging from 80% to 100%. However, animals that undergo vascular deprivation surgery may not survive the glucocorticoid induction process. As for cell models, 10-6mol/L Dexamethasone (Dex) to treat bone marrow stem cells, which is optimal for establishing cell models to study ONFH. The translational potential of this article: This review aims to summarize recent development in experimental models of ONFH and recommended the modeling schemes to verify new models, mechanisms, drugs, surgeries, and biomaterials of ONFH to contribute to the prevention and treatment of ONFH. © 2023 The Authors"
"Price forecasting is one of the fundamental techniques used in most businesses to improve the competitiveness and decision-making level. Nonetheless, it is a non-trivial task to make a model that provides high accuracy price prediction, especially in modern enterprises with ever longer, and more complex supply chains across the globe. In the classical approach for predictive problem, researchers applied the time series forecasting, but no decent outcome has been developed so far. This work suggests a new way to tackle this problem in the modern complex business world to predict the price of plastic resin by using the integration of textual information and numerical indicators input to deep learning models. Since the traditional methods which are based on historical price itself are not sufficient, external data like economic indicators or textual information gathered from news articles, can improve the performance of the models by catching the overall global economic sentiment. Word semantic is retrieved as a vector representation from pre-trained word embeddings called Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe). In addition, deep learning models have gained great attention in the past decade after showing promising performance in various applications including Natural Language Processing (NLP), computer vision, and voice recognition. Hence, deep learning models, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) are utilized in this research to deal with the complex and fluctuated price of plastic resin. The models’ performances are validated with root mean squared error metric. The training, validation, and test losses of ANN are between 100-200, 15-40, and 15-40, respectively. While the training, validation, and test losses of RNN are between 150-300, 40-70, and 40-70, respectively. Although the results show that RNN models perform a little poorer than ANN, both ANN and RNN show sufficient and satisfying result for plastic resin price prediction. This research also proposed new models designed to handle time series input data with a combination between textual and numerical data and contribute a new alternative strategy in petrochemical industries for more accurate price prediction which is the starting point for developing even more sophisticated and more accurate models in the future. ©2023 ICIC International."

Keywords concerning complications (cluster A), unspecific; neurologic issues (cluster B); surgery (generic words) (cluster C); specific gynaecologic operations (cluster D); and specific gynaecologic operations for pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence (cluster E) were extracted. Associations among clusters of keywords were assessed by using multiple runs of text-mining software Semantic Brand Score (SBS, https://semanticbrandscore.com/#primary). Association scores were converted into probabilities. The rate of neurologic complications in urogynaecologic surgery was calculated (“a priori” probability) by applying Bayes' theorem. Textual estimates of neurological injuries in urogynaecologic surgery are 0.035554 (95% confidence intervals 0.019607−0.0515001; no quantitative data were found). To test if the probability calculated on textual information was the same as quantitative data reports (“a posteriori” probability), the rate of neurologic complication of all gynaecologic surgery was calculated using a meta-analytics approach and was compared with the textual analysis value. Results: The rate of neurologic complications in gynaecologic surgery after meta-analytic data synthesis has been 0.016489 (95% confidence intervals 0.012163−0.022320), which is equal to the textual estimate (0.016889, 95% confidence intervals 0.019607−0.051501). Therefore, 0.035554 is a reliable likelihood to observe a neurologic complication in urogynaecologic surgery. Conclusion: Iatrogenic nerve injuries in urogynaecologic surgery are higher than whole gynaecologic surgery. Text-mining software SBS and probability conversion can provide reliable answers from overall scholars' opinions on unsolved clinical questions when better evidence is lacking. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Do Avicenna's extant works preserve any trace of his now-lost early philosophical production? This paper considers a hitherto neglected text, namely the chapter On Hypothetical Propositions from Avicenna's Concise Treatise on the Principles of Logic (Risāla mūÇ aza fī uá ūl al-maná iq, henceforth: RM). The new evidence offered by the RM chapter in question will lead to a different reading of another well-known passage of Avicenna's reworking of Aristotle's Prior Analytics (Qiyās) from the Book of Healing (Kitāb al-šifāÊ ). The clues gathered from an analysis of these two works will finally lead us to ponder the possibility that Avicenna may in fact have composed a (now lost) work on hypothetical propositions and syllogisms. Since Avicenna's RM is to date unedited, an edition, as well as an English translation of the relevant chapter, is also provided in the Appendix of this paper.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

"Background and purpose: Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most prevalent and undesirable side effects of taxane-containing chemotherapy regimens. This study aimed to investigate the effect of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) on the prevention of taxane-induced neuropathy (TIN). Experimental approach: MEDLINE, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and Google scholar were systemically applied as electronic databases from 2010 to 2019. The current systematic review was carried out based on the main considerations of PRISMA preferential reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses. Since there was no significant discrepancy, the random-effect model was used for 12-24 weeks' analysis (I 2 = 0%, P = 0.999). Findings/Results: Twelve related titles and abstracts were found during the search, 6 of them were excluded in the first phase. In the second phase, the full text of the remaining 6 articles was comprehensively evaluated and 3 papers were rejected. Finally, 3 articles complied with the inclusion criteria and pooled analyses. The meta-analysis showed a risk ratio of 0.796 (95% CI between 0.486 and 1.303), so, the effects model was used for 12-24 weeks' analysis (I 2 = 0%, P = 0.999) since no significant discrepancies were observed. There was no evidence of ALC's positive effect on the prevention of TIN during 12 weeks, and it was revealed that ALC significantly increased TIN in 24 weeks. Conclusion and implications: According to our findings, the hypothesis that ALC had a positive effect on preventing TIN in 12 weeks has not been proved; however, ALC led to an increase in the TIN in 24 weeks. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

"Purpose: In people with epilepsy achieving optimal dietary intake may be hampered by psychological and physical comorbidities associated with seizures, medication use, socioeconomic disadvantage and the use of therapeutic diets. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the reported dietary intake and nutritional status of children and adults with epilepsy. Methods: A systematic literature search was completed across Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL (all from inception to 4 November 2021). We included studies that reported dietary intake in adults and children diagnosed with epilepsy compared with local reference ranges, control groups or general populations. Studies using interventions and therapeutic diets were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the Study Quality Assessment Tools by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. A descriptive analysis was performed due to the heterogenous nature of the data. Results: The initial search returned 1214 articles. Full-text screening was completed for 98 studies and 19 studies met eligibility criteria and were included for extraction. These comprised of seven paediatric studies, eight adult studies and four studies that included both adult and paediatric cohorts. Sample size of cases in each study ranged from 17 to 3,220. Vitamin A, C, D and folate were the most frequently reported vitamins. Calcium, iron and zinc were the most commonly reported minerals. Most studies showed that people with epilepsy had poorer dietary intake and nutritional status compared with control groups or reference standards. Conclusion: There were limited studies on dietary intake and nutritional status in people with epilepsy. Most available studies suggested poorer status compared to non-epilepsy controls. The development of a validated dietary assessment tool specifically for epilepsy cohorts would enable comparison of findings across studies, and aid with appropriately tailoring nutrition advice to individuals with epilepsy. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"OBJECTIVE: Although cell-free DNA screening for sex chromosome abnormalities is increasingly used in clinical practice, its diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility remain unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the performance of cell-free DNA in the detection of sex chromosome abnormalities. DATA SOURCES: Medline and PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from inception to January 2022 for articles relating to cell-free DNA screening for sex chromosome abnormalities. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: Original articles, randomized control trials, conference abstracts, cohort and case-control studies, and case series with more than 10 cases with diagnostic confirmation were considered for inclusion. METHODS: Quality assessment of each included publication was performed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. The positive predictive value was calculated as the proportion of true positive cases among those who tested positive and underwent diagnostic testing. Sensitivity and specificity were pooled, and a summary receiver operating characteristic curve was produced using bivariate models that included studies that had diagnostic confirmation for high- and low-risk women. RESULTS: The search identified 7553 results. Of these, 380 proceeded to the full-text screening, of which 94 articles were included in the meta-analysis with a total of 1,531,240 women tested. All studies reported a confirmatory genetic test. The pooled positive predictive value was 49.4% (95% confidence interval, 45.8–53.1). The pooled positive predictive value was 32.0% (95% confidence interval, 27.0%–37.3%) for monosomy X, 67.6% (95% confidence interval, 62.5%–72.5%) for XXY, 57.5% (95% confidence interval, 51.7%–63.1%) for XXX, and 70.9% (95% confidence interval, 63.9%–77.1%) for XYY. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of cell-free DNA for sex chromosome abnormalities were 94.1% (95% confidence interval, 90.8%–96.3%) and 99.5% (95% confidence interval, 99.0%–99.7%), respectively, with an area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.934 (95% confidence interval, 0.907–0.989). CONCLUSION: Although the sensitivity and specificity of cell-free DNA for sex chromosome abnormalities are high, the positive predictive value was approximately 50%. The positive predictive value was higher for sex chromosome abnormalities with a supernumerary Y chromosome and lower for monosomy X. Clinicians should inform couples about these findings when offering cell-free DNA for sex chromosome abnormalities. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Purpose: We generated methods for evaluating clinical outcomes including treatment response in oncology using the unstructured data from electronic health records (EHR) in Japanese language. Methods: This retrospective analysis used medical record database and administrative data of University of Miyazaki Hospital in Japan of patients with lung/breast cancer. Treatment response (objective response [OR], stable disease [SD] or progressive disease [PD]) was adjudicated by two evaluators using clinicians’ progress notes, radiology reports and pathological reports of 15 patients with lung cancer (training data set). For assessing key terms to describe treatment response, natural language processing (NLP) rules were created from the texts identified by the evaluators and broken down by morphological analysis. The NLP rules were applied for assessing data of other 70 lung cancer and 30 breast cancer patients, who were not adjudicated, to examine if any difference in using key terms exist between these patients. Results: A total of 2,039 records in progress notes, 131 in radiology reports and 60 in pathological reports of 15 patients, were adjudicated. Progress notes were the most common primary source data for treatment assessment (60.7%), wherein, the most common key terms with high sensitivity and specificity to describe OR were “reduction/shrink”, for SD were “(no) remarkable change/(no) aggravation)” and for PD were “(limited) effect” and “enlargement/grow”. These key terms were also found in other larger cohorts of 70 patients with lung cancer and 30 patients with breast cancer. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that assessing response to anticancer therapy using Japanese EHRs is feasible by interpreting progress notes, radiology reports and Japanese key terms using NLP. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Background: External ventricular drain (EVD) insertion is often a lifesaving procedure frequently used in neurosurgical emergencies. It is routinely done at the bedside in the neurocritical care unit or in the emergency room. However, there are infectious and noninfectious complications associated with this procedure. This meta-analysis sought to evaluate the absolute risk associated with EVD hemorrhages, infections, and revisions. The secondary purpose was to identify and characterize risk factors for EVD complications. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE (PubMed) database for “external ventricular drain,” “external ventricular drain” + “complications” or “Hemorrhage” or “Infection” or “Revision” irrespective of publication year. Estimates from individual studies were combined using a random effects model, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with maximum likelihood specification. To investigate heterogeneity, the t2 and I2 tests were utilized. To evaluate for publication bias, a funnel plot was developed. Results: There were 260 total studies screened from our PubMed literature database search, with 176 studies selected for full-text review, and all of these 176 studies were included in the meta-analysis as they met the inclusion criteria. A total of 132,128 EVD insertions were reported, with a total of 130,609 participants having at least one EVD inserted. The pooled absolute risk (risk difference) and percentage of the total variability due to true heterogeneity (I2) for hemorrhagic complication was 1236/10,203 (risk difference: −0.63; 95% CI: −0.66 to −0.60; I2: 97.8%), infectious complication was 7278/125,909 (risk difference: −0.65; 95% CI: −0.67 to −0.64; I2: 99.7%), and EVD revision was 674/4416 (risk difference: −0.58; 95% CI: −0.65 to −0.51; I2: 98.5%). On funnel plot analysis, we had a variety of symmetrical plots, and asymmetrical plots, suggesting no bias in larger studies, and the lack of positive effects/methodological quality in smaller studies. Conclusions: In conclusion, these findings provide valuable information regarding the safety of one of the most important and most common neurosurgical procedures, EVD insertion. Implementing best-practice standards is recommended in order to reduce EVD-related complications. There is a need for more in-depth research into the independent risk factors associated with these complications, as well as confirmation of these findings by well-structured prospective studies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Purpose:""Spin"" refers to a form of language manipulation that positively reflects negative findings or downplays potential harms. Spin has been reported in randomized controlled trials of other surgical specialties, which can lead to the recommendation of subpar or ineffective treatments. The goal of this study was to characterize spin strategies and severity in statistically nonsignificant urology randomized controlled trials.Materials and Methods:A comprehensive search of MEDLINE and Embase for the top 5 urology journals, major urology subspecialty journals, and high-impact nonurology journals from 2019 to 2021 was conducted. Statistically nonsignificant randomized controlled trials with a defined primary outcome were included. Screening, data extraction, and spin assessment were performed in duplicate by 2 independent reviewers.Results:From the database search of 4,339 studies, 46 trials were included for analysis. Spin was identified in 35 studies (76%), with the majority of abstracts (n = 26, 57%) and main texts (n = 35, 76%) containing some level of spin. ""Obscuring the statistical nonsignificance of the primary outcome and focusing on statistically significant secondary results"" was the most frequently used strategy in abstracts, while ""other"" strategies not previously defined were the most commonly used strategies in main texts. Moderate or high spin severity was identified in 21 (46%) abstract and 22 (48%) main text conclusions.Conclusions:Overall, our results suggest that 76% of statistically nonsignificant urology randomized controlled trials contained some level of spin. Readers and writers should be aware of common spin strategies when interpreting nonsignificant results and critically appraise the significance of results when making decisions for clinical practice. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Objectives: Major observational studies report that the mortality rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is close to 40%. Different treatment strategies are required for each patient, according to the degree of ARDS. Early prediction of ARDS is helpful to implement targeted drug therapy and mechanical ventilation strategies for patients with different degrees of potential ARDS. In this paper, a new dynamic prediction machine learning model for ARDS incidence and severity is established and evaluated based on 28 parameters from ordinary monitors and ventilators, capable of dynamic prediction of the incidence and severity of ARDS. This new method is expected to meet the clinical practice requirements of user-friendliness and timeliness for wider application. Methods: A total of 4738 hospitalized patients who required ICU care from 159 hospitals are employed in this study. The models are trained by standardized data from electronic medical records. There are 28 structured, continuous non-invasive parameters that are recorded every hour. Seven machine learning models using only continuous, non-invasive parameters are developed for dynamic prediction and compared with methods trained by complete parameters and the traditional risk adjustment method (i.e., oxygenation saturation index method). Results: The optimal prediction performance (area under the curve) of the ARDS incidence and severity prediction models built using continuous noninvasive parameters reached0.8691 and 0.7765, respectively. In terms of mild and severe ARDS prediction, the AUC values are both above 0.85. The performance of the model using only continuous non-invasive parameters have an AUC of 0.0133 lower, in comparison with that employing a complete feature set, including continuous non-invasive parameters, demographic information, laboratory parameters and clinical natural language text. Conclusions: A machine learning method was developed in this study using only continuous non-invasive parameters for ARDS incidence and severity prediction. Because the continuous non-invasive parameters can be easily obtained from ordinary monitors and ventilators, the method presented in this study is friendly and convenient to use. It is expected to be applied in pre-hospital setting for early ARDS warning. © 2022"
"The celebrated proverb that “speech is silver, silence is golden” has a long multinational history and multiple specific meanings. In written texts punctuation can be considered one of its manifestations. Indeed, the virtue of effectively speaking and writing involves – often decisively – the capacity to apply the properly placed breaks. In the present study, based on a large corpus of world-famous and representative literary texts in seven major Western languages, it is shown that the distribution of intervals between consecutive punctuation marks can almost universally be characterized by only two parameters of the discrete Weibull distribution which can be given an intuitive interpretation in terms of the so-called hazard function. The values of these two parameters tend to be language-specific, however, and even appear to navigate translations. The properties of the computed hazard functions indicate that among the studied languages, English appears the least constrained by the necessity to place a consecutive punctuation mark to partition a sequence of words. Spanish reveals a similar tendency. The above characteristics manifest themselves when all consecutive punctuation marks are considered and not the sentence-ending ones only, and this fact is in accordance with the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis of intervals between the corresponding breaks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"This review aimed to update the clinical practice guidelines for managing adults with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS). The 22q11.2 Society recruited expert clinicians worldwide to revise the original clinical practice guidelines for adults in a stepwise process according to best practices: (1) a systematic literature search (1992-2021), (2) study selection and synthesis by clinical experts from 8 countries, covering 24 subspecialties, and (3) formulation of consensus recommendations based on the literature and further shaped by patient advocate survey results. Of 2441 22q11.2DS-relevant publications initially identified, 2344 received full-text review, with 2318 meeting inclusion criteria (clinical care relevance to 22q11.2DS) including 894 with potential relevance to adults. The evidence base remains limited. Thus multidisciplinary recommendations represent statements of current best practice for this evolving field, informed by the available literature. These recommendations provide guidance for the recognition, evaluation, surveillance, and management of the many emerging and chronic 22q11.2DS-associated multisystem morbidities relevant to adults. The recommendations also address key genetic counseling and psychosocial considerations for the increasing numbers of adults with this complex condition. © 2023 The Authors"
"Background: Unnecessary electronic health record (EHRs) documentation burden and usability issues have negatively impacted clinician well-being (e.g., burnout and moral distress). Purpose: This scoping review was conducted by members from three expert panels of the American Academy of Nurses to generate consensus on the evidence of both positive and negative impact of EHRs on clinicians. Methods: The scoping review was conducted based on Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. Results: The scoping review captured 1,886 publications screened against title and abstract 1,431 excluded, examined 448 in a full-text review, excluded 347 with 101 studies informing the final review. Discussion: Findings suggest few studies that have explored the positive impact of EHRs and more studies that have explored the clinician's satisfaction and work burden. Significant gaps were identified in associating distress to use of EHRs and minimal studies on EHRs’ impact on nurses. Conclusion: Examined the evidence of HIT's positive and negative impacts on clinician's practice, clinicians work environment, and if psychological impact differed among clinicians. © 2023 The Author(s)"
"The Himalayan orogeny is among the youngest mountain belts on the earth’s surface. The dynamic landscape of the Himalaya accommodates plentiful eminent geological–geomorphological–heritage sites. The present study assesses a hermit cave system at Lakhamandal valley, located in the Yamuna River basin, Northwest Himalaya. The valley is filled with valley-fill deposits, including a hermit cave complex excavated by sages and local people of the valley. This hermit cave complex is extended between the different terrace levels, one or/and two-story structures carved in the quaternary sediments with a slight opening. Throughout history, the Lakhamandal valley has been located near a pilgrimage route famously known for its cultural and historical significance reflected in many historical texts of the Indian subcontinent. In the last few decades, the growing infrastructure in the valley has drawn local and international tourists leading to multiple unorganised excavations of the hermit caves in the region. To recognise such a remarkable geological and historical feature, we introduce the Lakhamandal valley hermit cave complex geosite with a preliminary assessment with SWOT analysis augmenting with urgent concerns and recommendations further aiming at its validation for a geoheritage site. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to International Association for the Conservation of Geological Heritage."
"This paper investigates how the reader of prose fiction fills in the blanks regarding a fictional character’s membership category, action, and reason for the action. Aligning with an ethnomethodological approach to texts and appropriating membership categorization analysis (MCA), we analyze how the readers of J. D. Salinger, an author whose works are well known for their ambiguity and ambivalence, would grasp the unwritten identities of characters and the meanings of their actions. Our analysis specifies two types of methods deployed for the reader to understand the fictional texts. First, in an at-a-glance way, the reader can supply the missing categories and sequence of actions by turning to the commonsense knowledge and social norms regarding the association between the category and the activity. Second, the reader can construct various interpretations regarding the recognizably ambiguous scenes of the text by turning to the conceptual knowledge of the relevant social phenomena, the maxims specific to the act of storytelling, and the writer’s techniques peculiar to the fictional texts. The findings demonstrate the vast applicability of an MCA approach to the analysis of the work of reading prose fiction and shed light on the detailed operations of the author’s maxims and techniques in the textual configuration of prose fiction, thereby indicating the possibility of ethnomethodological analysis including the interwoven consideration of the reader’s activity and the textual organization. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Introduction: Counseling on the immediate postoperative experience for outpatient procedures is largely based on anecdotal experience. We devised a short messaging service (SMS) survey using mobile phone text messages to evaluate real-time patient recovery following outpatient thyroid or parathyroid surgery. Materials and methods: Daily automated SMS surveys were sent the evening of the operation until postoperative day 10. Pain, opioid use, voice quality, and energy levels were assessed. Impaired voice and energy was defined as a score < 2/3 of normal. Results: One hundred fifty five patients were enrolled with an overall response rate of 81.6%. One hundred thirty three patients had an individual response rate > 50% and were included in the final analysis. Median patient age was 60 y with 102 females (76.7%). Seventy patients (52.6%) underwent parathyroidectomy and 66 (49.6%) thyroidectomy and 10 (7.5%) neck dissection. Forty eight patients (36.1%) did not use any opioids postoperatively. Independent risk factors for higher total pain scores included thyroidectomy and patients with preoperative opioid or tobacco use, while increased opioid use was associated with age < 60 y, body mass index > 30 kg/m2, preoperative opioid or tobacco use, and history of anxiety or depression. Patients with loss of intraoperative recurrent laryngeal nerve signaling had a significantly worse overall voice score (54.65 versus 92.67, P < 0.001). Up to 10% of patients were still using opioids and/or reported impaired voice and energy levels beyond 1 wk postoperatively. Conclusions: Real-time SMS survey is an effective and potentially valuable way to monitor patient recovery following surgery. A subset of patients reported impaired voice and energy and was still using opioids beyond 1 wk after thyroid and parathyroid surgery and these patients may benefit from closer follow-up and earlier intervention. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to judge the sentiment of multimodal data uploaded by the Internet users on various social media platforms. On one hand, existing studies focus on the fusion mechanism of multimodal data such as text, audio and visual, but ignore the similarity of text and audio, text and visual, and the heterogeneity of audio and visual, resulting in deviation of sentiment analysis. On the other hand, multimodal data brings noise irrelevant to sentiment analysis, which affects the effectness of fusion. In this paper, we propose a Polar-Vector and Strength-Vector mixer model called PS-Mixer, which is based on MLP-Mixer, to achieve better communication between different modal data for multimodal sentiment analysis. Specifically, we design a Polar-Vector (PV) and a Strength-Vector (SV) for judging the polar and strength of sentiment separately. PV is obtained from the communication of text and visual features to decide the sentiment that is positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. SV is gained from the communication between the text and audio features to analyze the sentiment strength in the range of 0 to 3. Furthermore, we devise an MLP-Communication module (MLP-C) composed of several fully connected layers and activation functions to make the different modal features fully interact in both the horizontal and the vertical directions, which is a novel attempt to use MLP for multimodal information communication. Finally, we mix PV and SV to obtain a fusion vector to judge the sentiment state. The proposed PS-Mixer is tested on two publicly available datasets, CMU-MOSEI and CMU-MOSI, which achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on CMU-MOSEI compared with baseline methods.

"Individuals with an Eating Disorder (ED) are typically reluctant to seek help via traditional means (e.g., psychologists). However, recent evidence suggests that many individuals seek assistance via social media for weight and diet related concerns. Sophisticated approaches are needed to better distinguish those who may be in need of help for an ED from those who are simply commenting on ED in online social environments. In order to facilitate effective communication between individuals with or at-risk of an ED and healthcare professionals, this research exploits a deep learning model to differentiate the users with ED engagement (e.g., ED sufferers, healthcare professionals or communicators) over social media. For this purpose, a collection of Twitter data is compiled using Twitter application programming interface (API) on the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) Nectar research cloud. After collecting 1,400,000 Twitter biographies in total, a subset of 4000 biographies are annotated manually. This annotation enables the differentiation of users engaged with ED-focused language on social media into five categories: ED-user, healthcare professional, communicator, healthcare professional-communicator, and other. Based on these annotated categories, a predictive deep learning model based on bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and long short-term memory (LSTM) is developed. The model achieves an F1 score of 98.19% and an accuracy of 98.37%. It demonstrates the viability of detecting the individuals with possible ED risk and distinguishes them from other categories using their biography data. We further conducted a network analysis for investigating the communication network between these categories. Our analysis shows that ED-users are more secretive and self-protective, whereas the healthcare professionals and communicators frequently interact with each other and a wide range of other people. To the best of our knowledge, our research is the first of its kind for identifying the different user categories engaged with ED-focused communications on social media. © 2022"
"Isotope dilution (ID) is a widely used analytical technique to determine elemental abundance to a high degree of accuracy and precision, using a spiked isotope tracer. This technique also enables efficient correction of the inevitable phenomenon of analytical mass fractionation during mass spectrometric analysis. It is also used to determine stable isotope variations of an element in a sample relative to a reference material, using tracers enriched in two isotopes (popularly known as the double spike method). Isotope dilution data reduction can be performed in Microsoft® Excel™ using different algorithmic approaches. Additional software such as iolite and MATLAB® offer algorithm implementations to perform these calculations. These are however limited to use within particular laboratories/research groups, or either require additional cost-bound software or some degree of knowledge in computer programming languages for use, or all of these. To ease this situation, a graphical user interface-based software is proposed (here named Parmanu-Gunak, meaning Atom-Calculator in Sanskrit text) to invert both single and double spiked isotope data, with the aim of making it a standard tool for ID data reduction. Examples of Nd and Mo isotopes are used to demonstrate the robustness of the program. © 2022 The Author. Geostandards and Geoanalytical Research © 2022 International Association of Geoanalysts."

"With the miniaturization of printed circuit board (PCB), the distance between the circuit traces or assembled component terminals is becoming smaller and smaller. Under the certain temperature, relative humidity, and bias voltage (THB), it is easier for the insulation performance between circuits to degrade due to electrochemical migration (ECM). The airborne dust deposited on the PCB during a long-term service may change the failure mechanism and time to failure (TTF) of ECM between circuits. In this paper, the mechanism and the characteristics of the combined effects of quartz particles in airborne dust, the temperature, the relative humidity and the bias voltage on the ECM failure of immersion silver finished PCB were studied by THB experiments. Then, the influencing significance of four factors on TTF of ECM were studied by the orthogonal test and range analysis. The results show that the silver cations migrate firstly but the exposed copper substrate on the positive electrode become the main migrated substance finally. The TTF of ECM changes non-monotonously with the increase of particle coverage density due to the bidirectional function of the insoluble particles, which can increase water condensation on PCB by the capillary action, but can extend the migration path of metal cations by physical barriers. The turning point is about the coverage density of $350~\mu \text{g}$ /cm 2. The insoluble particles with high coverage density can significantly shorten the TTF of ECM on the PCB than that with low coverage density under the same THB conditions.  © 2001-2011 IEEE."
"Purpose: To review the literature on the efficacy of surgical procedures to improve visual acuity (VA) in patients with infantile nystagmus syndrome (INS). Methods: Literature searches were last conducted in January 2022 in the PubMed database for English-language studies with no date restrictions. The combined searches yielded 354 abstracts, of which 46 were reviewed in full text. Twenty-three of these were considered appropriate for inclusion in this assessment and were assigned a level of evidence rating by the panel methodologist. Results: One included study was a randomized trial; the remaining 22 were case series. The 23 studies included children and adults with INS and a variable proportion with anomalous head position (AHP), strabismus, and sensory diagnoses. The surgical interventions evaluated included large recessions, tenotomy and reattachment (TAR), myectomy with or without pulley fixation, and anterior extirpation of the 4 horizontal rectus muscles, as well as various procedures to correct an AHP in which VA was reported as a secondary outcome. The data were mixed, with improvements in binocular best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) ranging from no improvement to 0.3 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), or 3 lines. (Most studies were in the range of 0.05–0.2 logMAR.) Statistically significant improvement in VA was noted in 12 of 16 studies (75%) that performed statistical analyses, with no clear advantage of any single procedure. Complications and reoperations were lowest in patients who underwent TAR and highest in those who underwent myectomy or anterior extirpation. Conclusions: The best available evidence suggests that eye muscle surgery in patients with INS results in a modest improvement in VA.

We found that the in-person positions emphasized more on the skills of verbal, interpersonal, and organizational communication, whereas the remote positions asked more for written communication. While the in-person positions had higher expectations of using general data management and analysis tools, the remote positions emphasized more on the use of social media analytics and digital marketing tools. © AEJMC 2022."
"Background: Virtual Reality (VR) is becoming a popular educational tool in healthcare. This scoping review aimed to (1) determine if VR can be used to reduce the anxiety a patient experiences during an MRI and (2) explore how VR is being used to train MRI technologists. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHEL, and PsycINFO internet websites of VR in MRI were evaluated. Two authors independently reviewed the titles and abstracts using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Articles chosen by both reviewers were automatically included for full text review. Articles chosen by one reviewer were audited by a third independent reviewer to determine inclusion for full text review. Descriptive analyses were conducted. Results: The initial search resulted in 357 articles. A large portion of the articles were excluded because they were either based on fMRI or training-based tools for healthcare professionals, which were not our area of focus. Eight articles were included in the final review for assessing if VR can be a useful tool to aid with patient anxiety in MRI. No articles were found that used VR in MRI technologist training. Conclusions: This scoping review suggests there are potentially significant uses for VR in reducing anxiety in adults and children as patients. With further research and development of VR application for use with MRI testing may allow for better patient preparation and reduce scan interruptions, increase MRI operational efficiency, and improve patient outcomes © 2022"
"Over two million people depend on the Sundarbans for direct or indirect subsistence. Most of the poor and resource-dependent populations rely significantly on fishing for their subsistence in the absence of alternative work and income possibilities. Various global conventions impact national policy, putting pressure on state forest officials to maintain the Sundarbans in order to protect the flagship faunal species, the Royal Bengal tiger, and the pristine ecology. This article examines how the limits imposed on the Sundarbans to protect its biodiversity have affected fishermen's access to forest resources, as well as how the locals have reacted to these constraints in order to maintain their way of life. Given the paucity of research on the subject, we anticipate that the findings of this study will be practical and beneficial to policymakers and practitioners alike. Interviews with key informants, stakeholder input in the form of focus group discussions, documentary research (news reports and government documents), and uncontrolled personal observation were the primary empirical data gathering methods using a semi-structured questionnaire. Inductive contentment analysis was used to examine data with NVivo 12 software. Consequently, the text is organized around four thematic focuses. It begins with a brief history of forest management from the viewpoint of fisheries to demonstrate how the state's intervention to limit local access to fisheries resources exacerbated the socioeconomic vulnerabilities of the local populace. The second piece explores conventional fishing activities in the Sundarbans, while the third section investigates the fishing community's response to the imposed restriction. We discovered that the restrictions imposed to ensure conservation had a severe impact on the livelihood of locals, resulting in unsustainable fishing in the Sundarbans through the adoption of a negotiated system between the forest department and fishermen, i.e., corruption. In Section 4, the article wraps up by discussing a few crucial ideas that can be used to address issues brought on by restrictions. © 2022"
"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders around the world that can endanger reproductive, metabolic, and psychological health in women. Flaxseed is considered as a functional food which provides remarkable amounts of α-linolenic acid (ALA), phytosterogenic lignans, and dietary fibers. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of flaxseed or its oil supplementation on PCOS patients. We systematically searched all published randomized clinical trials indexed in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases from inception up to May 2022. Intended exposure and outcome were flaxseed or its oil and metabolic, anthropometric, and hormonal status of women with PCOS, respectively. Initial search via related keywords revealed 69 articles. After excluding duplicates, title and abstract of 55 remaining papers were screened. Fourteen papers were obtained for full text screening. Finally, nine clinical trials published between 2011 and 2021 were included in qualitative synthesis. Based on the results of the present systematic review, we suggest that flaxseed supplementation has the potential to improve metabolic, hormonal, and anthropometric parameters in women with PCOS. However, we also deduce that due to the scarcity of high-quality studies, additional studies need to be conducted in order to derive a solid conclusion. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Objective: To explore the experiences, information and support needs of parents/caregivers of children with cancer and how these changed as the COVID-19 pandemic evolved. Design Online surveys containing closed and free-text questions on experiences, information and support needs were completed at four time points (between April 2020 and October 2021) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive statistics of closed items and content analysis of qualitative data were conducted. Setting Online. Participants Parents/caregivers of children with cancer. Results: 335 parents/caregivers completed the survey over four time points. Findings revealed that parents'/caregivers' worry about the virus and vigilance about their child's virus symptoms decreased over time. Parents reporting the need for support on how to reduce their worries and/or family members during the virus outbreak were low, however parents reported a slight increase in need for support at T3 when schools reopened. Qualitative findings reported the following themes: (1) Psychological well-being of parents/caregivers, (2) Changing perceptions of risks/priorities, (3) Adjusting to COVID-19: Living with continued caution, (4) Healthcare and treatment provision, (5) Information seeking and needs during COVID-19. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted people's lives and routines in relation to access to support, finances, education and social lives, leading to psychological distress. Parents highlighted the need for timely, up-to-date and personalised information in relation to COVID-19 and their child with cancer. Further consideration of the development of technology-based health solutions may provide an efficient and safe way to connect with and support parent/caregivers.  © 2023 Author(s) (or their employer(s))."
"Over the last 25 years, the BRICs asserted themselves as drivers of globalization. But what does their new-found prominence mean for working conditions at home? Using a novel sub-national database covering outward investment linkages and working conditions in Brazilian municipalities, this study tests whether a direct investment in Europe leads to the introduction of decent working conditions in Brazil. The empirical results provide strong support for the investing-up effect using a mixture of panel data analysis and text analysis. The results suggest that economic integration with high-standard developed countries can act as a powerful mechanism for labor standard improvements in developing countries. © 2022 The Authors.

"Corporate social responsibility, and its other conceptual variants such as corporate sustainability, encourages businesses to act on a range of issues outside what the law and shareholders require. But what are the limits of the concept and its discursive practices in a globalizing world marked by accentuated asymmetrical power relations between businesses, and the communities they operate in and serve (especially corporations working in less powerful global peripheries), and the regulators who are expected to police them? This study uses the discourse-historical approach (DHA) and corporate sustainability framework (CSF) to analyze a British independent oil production firm's—Tullow—communication. It illustrates the utility of the DHA and the CSF for doing critical stakeholder and issues analysis from corporate communication texts. Second, it argues that corporate sustainability illustrates the power asymmetry between the global and local, corporations and community. Specifically, we observe how a petroleum firm uses sustainability discourse, as a form of hegemonic globalization, to perpetuate dominant tropes and conceptions about African local communities as homogeneous and lacking agency, commodifying the lived experiences of the locals in the process while entrenching the superiority of the firm's own position as a ‘benevolent dictator.’ We also illustrate how particular mitigation and intensification discourse techniques are employed to uphold Tullow as a ‘do-good’ actor. The corporation's discursive strategies have a cumulative effect of cementing the power asymmetry that already exists between the firm as an agent of a dominant center of global power and Ghanaian communities as less powerful interests in the globalization process. Suggestions for disrupting the hegemony are provided. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Invasion by exotic pests into new geographic areas can cause major disturbances in forest and agricultural systems. Early response can greatly improve containment efforts, underscoring the importance of collecting up-to-date information about the locations where pest species are being observed. However, existing invasive species databases have limitations in both extent and rapidity. The spatial extent is limited by costs and there are delays between species establishment, official recording, and consolidation. Local online news outlets have the potential to provide supplemental spatial coverage worldwide and social media has the potential to provide direct observations and denser historical data for modeling. Gathering data from these online sources presents its own challenges and their potential contribution to historical tracking of pest invasions has not previously been tested. To this end, we examine the practical considerations for using three online aggregators, the Global Database of Events, Language and Tone (GDELT), Google News, and a commercial media listening platform, Brandwatch, to support pest biosurveillance. Using these tools, we investigate the presence and nature of cogent mentions of invasive species in these sources by conducting case studies of online news and Twitter excerpts regarding two invasive plant pests, Spotted Lanternfly and Tuta absoluta. Our results using past data demonstrate that online news and social media may provide valuable data streams to supplement official sources describing pest invasions. © 2022"
"Released 4 years ago, the Wallace EcoMod application (R package wallace) provided an open-source and interactive platform for modeling species niches and distributions that served as a reproducible toolbox and educational resource. wallace harnesses R package tools documented in the literature and makes them available via a graphical user interface that runs analyses and returns code to document and reproduce them. Since its release, feedback from users and partners helped identify key areas for advancement, leading to the development of wallace 2. Following the vision of growth by community expansion, the core development team engaged with collaborators and undertook a major restructuring of the application to enable: simplified addition of custom modules to expand methodological options, analyses for multiple species in the same session, improved metadata features, new database connections, and saving/loading sessions. wallace 2 features nine new modules and added functionalities that facilitate data acquisition from climate-simulation, botanical and paleontological databases; custom data inputs; model metadata tracking; and citations for R packages used (to promote documentation and give credit to developers). Three of these modules compose a new component for environmental space analyses (e.g., niche overlap). This expansion was paired with outreach to the biogeography and biodiversity communities, including international presentations and workshops that take advantage of the software's extensive guidance text. Additionally, the advances extend accessibility with a cloud-computing implementation and include a suite of comprehensive unit tests. The features in wallace 2 greatly improve its expandability, breadth of analyses, and reproducibility options, including the use of emerging metadata standards. The new architecture serves as an example for other modular software, especially those developed using the rapidly proliferating R package shiny, by showcasing straightforward module ingestion and unit testing. Importantly, wallace 2 sets the stage for future expansions, including those enabling biodiversity estimation and threat assessments for conservation. © 2023 The Authors.

"The issue of no-shows in radiology is complicated and challenging. Mammography and ultrasound have the highest rate of no-shows among radiologic exams. Screening mammography is one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce breast cancer related deaths. However, the benefit of screening is heavily dependent on patient compliance to routine exams. Enhancing patients’ commitments to their scheduled appointments, thereby improving early detection and decreasing breast cancer related mortality. Retrospective analysis of no-show visits scheduled from August 2017 to December 2017 (before the implementation of combined phone, email and text-based reminders) and from August 2019 to December 2019 (after the implementation of reminder and follow-up phone calls after missed appointments by the coordinator) in an urban academic breast imaging center was conducted. There were 368 no-show patients in 2017 and 238 no-show patients in 2019. Percentage of no-shows, and delay time to the rescheduled missed appointment were calculated. Subgroup analysis of the type of studies that were missed and those who did not reschedule the missed appointment was conducted. Mann Whitney U test was used to analyze differences between group means. No-show visits decreased by 50% in 2019 when compared to 2017. The average wait time between the missed appointment and the rescheduled appointment decreased significantly from 30.7 weeks in 2017 to 12.1 weeks in 2019 (P = 0.047). The percentage of no-show visits was highest among the unemployed, patients scheduled for screening mammograms and patients with a high average of no-show visits. No-show visits adversely impact patient outcome and contribute to increased cost of healthcare. Through a deeper understanding of the factors contributing to no-shows, we can strive to make appropriate interventions to alleviate the consequences of no-shows. © 2022"

"Objective: The aim of this study was to examine women's experience of menopausal transition and their expectations and wishes for support from healthcare. Further, to examine their knowledge about menopause and thoughts about current attitudes in healthcare and in society generally. Methods: Data was collected through three focus group interviews with 14 women experiencing menopausal symptoms. The qualitative analysis was transacted through systematic text condensation, where categories were derived from data. Results: The women in this study told us about being inadequately prepared for menopause through having insufficient knowledge of the menopausal transition. They experienced lack of clarity about where in the health care system they could get help and that knowledge of menopause varied among healthcare staff. The attitudes to menopause experienced by women in this study were both positive and negative, but they often equated menopause with getting old. To be better prepared for the climacteric transition, the women wanted information from health care professionals and they wanted menopausal care to be easily accessible and local. If needed, it should be possible to access clinics providing specialist care. Conclusion: This work indicates that women want more and improved information about menopause in order to be better prepared. Advice and treatment for menopausal healthcare care should be easily accessible for women. Improved education and care guidelines for menopausal problems can be helpful for healthcare staff. © 2022 The Authors"
"Voice-driven communication assistive systems—speech enhancement (SE), voice conversion (VC), and automatic speech recognition with text-to-speech (ASR-TTS)—are recognized approaches for improving dysarthric speakers’ speech intelligibility. However, which approach performs better for moderate dysarthric patients is unclear. This study compared the benefits of three classic difference-type voice-driven assistive systems for dysarthric patients under identical test conditions. The benefits of the three systems for dysarthric patients’ speech intelligibility were compared; 14 mild-to-severe dysarthric patients and five speakers with normal speech were invited to record the training sets for these systems. Five moderate dysarthric patients were selected to record two additional testing sets, which were used for evaluating the systems’ benefits. Google Automatic Speech Recognition's (Google ASR) evaluation metrics and listening tests verified each system's speech intelligibility and quality. The speech intelligibility results produced by Google ASR were 7.0%, 22.9%, and 93.8% for the SE, VC, and ASR-TTS systems, respectively. Regarding the listening test, the performance of speech intelligibility and quality were 38.7%, 40.5%, 95.5%, and 1.81, 2.18, 4.56 for SE, VC, and ASR-TTS systems, respectively. The ASR-TTS system performed better than SE and VC. Furthermore, t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis was used to additionally compare the differences between the systems. The t-SNE analysis results indicated that ASR-TTS’ phonetic posteriorgram features provided stable performance compared with the other speech features (log-power spectrum and spectra) in the SE and VC systems. Results showed that the ASR-TTS is a potential system to improve moderate dysarthric patients’ speech intelligibility and quality in future applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Understanding customer feedback is becoming a necessity for companies to identify problems and improve their products and services. Text classification and sentiment analysis can play a major role in analyzing this data by using a variety of machine and deep learning approaches. In this work, different transformer-based models are utilized to explore how efficient these models are when working with a German customer feedback dataset. In addition, these pre-trained models are further analyzed to determine if adapting them to a specific domain using unlabeled data can yield better results than off-the-shelf pre-trained models. To evaluate the models, two downstream tasks from the GermEval 2017 are considered. The experimental results show that transformer-based models can reach significant improvements compared to a fastText baseline and outperform the published scores and previous models. For the subtask Relevance Classification, the best models achieve a micro-averaged F1-Score of 96.1 % on the first test set and 95.9 % on the second one, and a score of 85.1 % and 85.3 % for the subtask Polarity Classification. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Text mining on a large corpus of data has gained utility and popularity over recent years owing to advancements in information retrieval and machine learning methods. However, popular text mining software packages mainly focus on either sentiment analysis or semantic meaning extraction, requiring pretraining on a large corpus of text data. In comparison, MoreThanSentiments provides computation of newer text attribution measures, including boiler score, specificity, redundancy, and hard info, which have been proposed in accounting analytics literature. Our software package, available in Python, is flexible in terms of parameter setting and is adaptable to different applications. Through this package, we seek to simplify the process of deploying nontrivial information extraction techniques published in domain-specific text analysis research into domain-agnostic analytics applications. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"This article proposes to start considering the role that citizens play in platform governance as a way of critically reflecting on issues of inclusivity in and effectiveness of current decision-making processes. This article attempts to apply the above suggestion by studying citizens’ discourse in recent European efforts to regulate online content. It does so by employing an experimental methodology, namely, a computationally assisted Critical Discourse Analysis on textual data derived from citizens’ contributions to the European Commission’s Public Consultations on three crucial regulatory texts: the Code of Practice on Disinformation, the Recommendation on Tackling Illegal Content Online and the Digital Services Act. The present analysis suggests that the EU’s strategy to advance participatory governance through public consultations seems to ignore citizens’ qualitative input and, thus, the feedback received can be severely limited. Concluding, the article maintains that scholarship should adopt a more encompassing scope when studying platform governance, especially concerning citizen and user participation, beyond the traditional frame of participation through civil society representation, while critically scrutinising existing ostensibly participatory structures. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Background: Emergency healthcare professionals (EHPs) face significant occupational stressors requiring the skilled use of adaptive coping strategies. Some EHP resort to maladaptive coping (MC) strategies that negatively impact their mental health, yet MC strategies are not clearly defined in the literature. Examining factors that predispose EHP to MC can support interventions to improve coping and well-being. Objective: This systematic review examined MC among EHP working in pre-hospital and hospital-based settings. The primary aim was to identify factors associated with MC strategies used by EHP. Methods: Embase, Ovid, CINAHL Plus, PsychInfo, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for quantitative studies measuring MC use among EHP. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2020 checklist was used to guide the review. Studies were included if they: (a) targeted licensed healthcare professionals providing patient care, (b) occurred in emergency department or pre-hospital emergency setting, and (c) examined provider coping. Studies were excluded if they: (a) did not include EHPs, (b) did not differentiate results in mixed samples, (c) did not clearly measure coping strategies, (d) failed to include MC strategies in the results, or (e) were not available in full text. Risk of bias and study quality was appraised using Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist. Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) guided the final synthesis, drawing conclusions from the evidence to identify factors associated with MC in EHP. Results: A total of 14 cross-sectional studies, published between 2003 and 2021, were included in the review. Included studies were conducted in either pre-hospital, hospital, or a combination of both settings. Most studies included mixed samples or emergency physicians. A variety of coping strategies were significantly correlated with poor mental health outcomes including venting, denial, disengagement, self-blame, and substance use. Among personal factors, EHPs who were female, older than 50, living alone, with personal trauma history were significantly more likely to use MC strategies. Additionally, EHP with children, work experience, higher life satisfaction, and resilience were negatively associated with MC. Environmental factors positively associated with MC included work stress, workload, and poor benefits. Trauma exposure had a positive, but non-significant relationship. Conclusions: Emergency healthcare professionals use a variety of coping strategies, many of which are maladaptive and significantly related to poor mental health outcomes. Several personal and environmental factors contribute to behavior that reflect the use of MC strategies, but findings are sparse. Researchers should consider current limitations and challenges, particularly mental health stigma, when designing future studies. Clinical Relevance: The evidence in this review suggests that certain factors predispose EHP for use of MC strategies. This review highlights an important research gap necessitating more robust studies to identify MC risk factors among EHP in chronically high-stress environments. © 2022 Sigma Theta Tau International."
"Objective: To provide an overview of studies that describe the preferred mode and format of delivery of patient education materials to older adults. Methods: A scoping review was used to identify relevant literature published between January 2010 and June 2021, with specific attention given to studies conducted in high income countries with similar health systems. Results: A total of 3245 titles were identified, and 20 met the inclusion criteria and were included in this scoping review. Older adults preferred written information that could be accessed via health professionals or downloaded online. Other key features were identified including logical layout, signposted information, larger text size, labelled visual aids, and use of images appropriate and relevant to the target group were preferred. Audio visual resources were also considered valuable when well designed. Formats for patient education such as apps, group classes and online courses were less popular with older adults. Conclusions: Patient education materials for older adults should be carefully designed, with attention to layout and content. Older adults indicated a preference for hard copy handouts or in a format that can be downloaded. Practice Implications: Regular engagement with older consumers about their preferences is important as technology for delivery of patient education materials evolve. Key features for specific attention during the design process include a logical layout (tested with consumers), signposted information, text size, labelled visual aids and appropriate images. The perspectives of other key groups of older adults such as those from minority populations or other disadvantaged groups are largely unexplored. © 2022"
"We investigate the feasibility of machine learning methods for attributional content and framing analysis in corporate reporting. We test the performance of five widely-used supervised machine learning classifiers (naïve Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, decision trees) in a top-down three-level hierarchical setting to (1) identify performance-related statements; (2) detect attributions in these; and (3) classify the content of the attributional statements. The training set comprises manually coded statements from a corpus of management commentary reports of listed companies. The attributions include both intra- and inter-sentential attributional statements. The results show that for both intra- and inter-sentential attributions, F1-scores of our most accurate classifier (i.e., support vector machines) vary in the range of 76% up to 94%, depending on the identification, detection and classification levels and the content characteristics of attributions. Additionally, we assess the hierarchical performance of classifiers, providing insights into a more holistic classification process for attributional statements. Overall, our results show how machine learning methods may facilitate narrative disclosure analysis by providing a more efficient way to detect and classify performance-related attributional statements. Our findings contribute to the accounting and management literature by providing a basis for implementing machine learning methodologies for research investigating attributional behavior and related impression management. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"How can civil sphere theory contribute to class analysis? In contrast to critics who suggest Jeffrey Alexander’s The Civil Sphere does not take class seriously, this paper argues that class is a central component to both the rhetorical argument and empirical justification of the text. Through a new reading of the book’s discussions and references to class, this paper provides the rudiments for a new civil sphere theory of social class. The paper first demonstrates how Alexander uses social class as a rhetorical foil against instrumentalist, class-centric models of civil society. Second, the paper elaborates on the obscured but rich set of references to historical cases of class formation to push civil sphere theory towards attending to the creative discursive and institutional action of class movements in the civil sphere. Third, the paper develops Alexander’s concept of ‘refraction’ and argues that the ways in which class communities create new cultures better explains the relationship between classes and the civil sphere. In the conclusion, the paper offers two directions for a civil sphere theory of class – a realist one which posits social classes are products of the economy and then become meaningfully civil as they approach the civil sphere; and an interpretivist one which posits that classes are already-meaningful structures in both the economy and the civil sphere, leading to an open-ended transformation of both. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to review and quantify the changes in gait parameters after therapeutic intervention in adults with neurologic disorders. Data Sources: A keyword search was performed in 4 databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science (01/2000-12/2021). We performed the search algorithm including all possible combinations of keywords. Full-text articles were examined further using forward/backward search methods. Study Selection: Studies were thoroughly screened using the following inclusion criteria: Study design: randomized controlled trial; adults ≥55 years old with a neurologic disorder; therapeutic intervention; spatiotemporal gait characteristics; and language: English. Data Extraction: A standardized data extraction form was used to collect the following methodological outcome variables from each of the included studies: author, year, population, age, sample size, and spatiotemporal gait parameters such as cadence, step length, step width, or double limb support. A meta-analysis was performed among trials presenting with similar characteristics, including study population and outcome measure. If heterogeneity was >50%, a random plot analysis was used; otherwise, a fixed plot analysis was done. Data Synthesis: We included 25 out of 34 studies in our meta-analysis that examined gait in adults with neurologic disorders. All analyses used effect sizes and standard error and a P<.05(denoted by *) threshold was considered statistically significant. Overall, we found that sensory (SS) and electrical stimulation (ES) had the most significant effect on step length (SS: z=5.44*, ES: z=2.42*) and gait speed (SS: z=6.19*, ES: z=7.38*) in adults with Parkinson disease (PD). Although balance or physical activity interventions were not found to be effective in modifying step length in adults with PD, they showed a significant effect on gait speed. Further, physical activity had the most significant effect on cadence in adults with PD (z=2.84*) relative to sensory stimulation effect on cadence (z=2.59*). For stroke, conventional physical therapy had the most significant effect on step length (z=3.12*) and cadence (z=3.57*). Conclusion: Sensory stimulation such as auditory and somatosensory stimulation while walking had the most significant effect on step length in adults with PD. We also found that conventional physical therapy did improve spatial gait parameters relative to other physical activity interventions in adults with PD and stroke. © 2022 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine"
"Vehicle automation, manifested in self-driving cars, promises to provide safe mobility by reducing human errors. While the testing of automated vehicles (AVs) has improved their performance in recent years, automation technologies face challenges such as uncertainty of safety impacts in mixed traffic with human-driven vehicles. This study aims to examine the gaps in AV safety performance and identify what will be required on a preferential basis for AVs to guarantee an acceptable level of safety performance, especially in mixed traffic, by conducting a thorough analysis of crashes involving levels 2–3 AVs. Based on 260 AV collision reports from California from 2019 to 2021, this study extracts crash-related variables from crash records in a standardized form, crash locations, and, notably, crash narratives reported by AV manufacturers. This study untangles the complex interrelationships among pre-crash conditions, AV driving modes, crash types, and crash outcomes by applying a path-analytic framework with the frequentist and Bayesian approaches. Results show that 51.9 percent of crashes were rear-ends. Particularly, AVs become more vulnerable to rear-end collisions in the automated driving mode than in the conventional mode, given a crash. Additionally, the automated driving mode would not significantly affect the chance of a sideswipe collision, injury, or AV damage levels. Another interesting finding is that manual disengagement is more likely to happen when an AV interacts with a transit vehicle right before a crash occurs while having a negative relationship with injury crashes. Moreover, to reduce injury crashes, AVs would need more thorough testing to adapt to the critical roadway and infrastructure features such as intersections, ramps, and slip lanes; and roadway infrastructure would require improvements to support transportation automation. The risk factors identified in this study can be considered in AV safety assessment scenarios and future operations of mixed traffic. This study demonstrates that AV crash narrative data can be leveraged to improve knowledge of AV safety in mixed traffic. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Conceptual metaphor detection is a well-researched topic in Natural Language Processing. At the same time, conceptual metaphor use analysis produces unique insight into individual psychological processes and characteristics, as demonstrated by research in cognitive psychology. Despite the fact that state-of-the-art language models allow for highly effective automatic detection of conceptual metaphor in benchmark datasets, the models have never been applied to psychological tasks. The benchmark datasets differ a lot from experimental texts recorded or produced in a psychological setting, in their domain, genre, and the scope of metaphoric expressions covered. We present the first experiment to apply NLP metaphor detection methods to a psychological task, specifically, analyzing individual differences. For that, we annotate MetPersonality, a dataset of Russian texts written in a psychological experiment setting, with conceptual metaphor. With a widely used conceptual metaphor annotation procedure, we obtain low annotation quality, which arises from the dataset characteristics uncommon in typical automatic metaphor detection tasks. We suggest a novel conceptual metaphor annotation procedure to mitigate issues in annotation quality, increasing the inter-annotator agreement to a moderately high level. We leverage the annotated dataset and existing metaphor datasets in Russian to select, train and evaluate state-of-the-art metaphor detection models, obtaining acceptable results in the metaphor detection task. In turn, the most effective model is used to detect conceptual metaphor automatically in RusPersonality, a larger dataset containing meta-information on psychological traits of the participant authors. Finally, we analyze correlations of automatically detected metaphor use with psychological traits encoded in the Freiburg Personality Inventory (FPI). Our pioneering work on automatically-detected metaphor use and individual differences demonstrates the possibility of unprecedented large-scale research on the relation between of metaphor use and personality traits and dispositions, cognitive and emotional processing. © 2022"
"Background: Nurses’ knowledge of heart failure (HF) is highly variable, ranging from expert to poor, potentially leading to inadequate self-care. Objectives: (1) document the knowledge variation of HF assessment and management among specialist and generalist nurses; (2) determine factors that may be associated with nurses’ knowledge; and (3) describe nurses’ views of knowledge deficits and ways to improve nurses’ knowledge to better meet the needs educational interventions. Method: Members of the American Association of Heart Failure Nurses and Registered Nurses were invited to participate in a cross-sectional survey. Independent samples t-test, chi-square, and linear regression were used for quantitative analysis. Text analysis was applied to analyze the themes of qualitative comments. Results: A total of 918 nurses completed the survey. Specialist nurses had higher scores than generalist nurses with statistically significant F-test for diet, fluid, signs/symptoms, medication, and exercise. Both specialist and generalist nurses were least knowledgeable about dry weight, asymptomatic hypotension, and transient dizziness. Being a specialist nurse was associated with higher level of knowledge scores. Years of experience and race were significant factors associated with knowledge scores in generalist nurses. Confidence level and race were significant predictors for specialist nurses. Three themes emerged regarding the cause of nurses’ insufficient knowledge and several approaches were provided. Conclusions: Specialist nurses are not only knowledgeable, but their knowledge levels are less variable compared to generalist nurses. There is a need to identify additional factors that may potentially influence nurses’ knowledge, contributing to the effectiveness of interventions. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Over the past decade, social media applications have significantly increased their market share and garnered a wide user base. However, these applications have also attracted the attention of criminals desiring to exploit the apps to support illicit operations due to the low barrier to entry and ease of usage. A digital forensic investigation of these applications can reveal valuable information about criminal activity and the suspect. Discord is a Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) service that enables text, image, video, and audio chats. It has grown in popularity, and as a result, it is subject to increased use by cybercriminals. In this paper, we examine the remnants of the increasingly popular social media application ‘‘Discord” when used on the Google Chrome web browser. We recovered various artifacts such as payment information, sent messages, account settings, conversations, uploaded attachments, and much more, all of which could be utilized in a forensic investigation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Purpose: There is a lack of uniformity in the definition of normal ovary ultrasound parameters. Our aim was to summarize and meta-analyze the evidence on the topic. Full-text English articles published through December 31, 2020 were retrieved via MEDLINE and Embase. Data available for meta-analysis included: ovarian follicular count, ovarian volume, and ovarian Pulsatility Index (PI) assessed by Doppler ultrasound. Methods: Cohort, cross-sectional, prospective studies with a single or double arm were considered eligible. Interventional studies were included when providing baseline data. Both studies on pre- and post-menopausal women were screened; however, data on menopausal women were not sufficient to perform a meta-analysis. Studies on pre-pubertal girls were considered separately. Eighty-one papers were included in the meta-analysis. Results: The mean ovarian volume was 6.11 [5.81–6.42] ml in healthy women in reproductive age (5.81–6.42) and 1.67 ml [1.02–2.32] in pre-pubertal girls. In reproductive age, the mean follicular count was 8.04 [7.26–8.82] when calculated in the whole ovary and 5.88 [5.20–6.56] in an ovarian section, and the mean ovarian PI was 1.86 [1.35–2.37]. Age and the frequency of the transducers partly modulated these values. In particular, the 25–30-year group showed the higher mean follicular count (9.27 [7.71–10.82]), followed by a progressive age-related reduction (5.67 [2.23–9.12] in fertile women > 35 years). A significant difference in follicular count was also found according to the transducer’s upper MHz limit. Conclusion: Our findings provide a significant input to improve the interpretation and diagnostic accuracy of ovarian ultrasound parameters in different physiological and pathological settings. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Objective: In this study, we aim to review the current evidence of Food is Medicine interventions on diabetes outcomes among low-income or food-insecure individuals. Methods: Seven databases were searched from January 1, 2000 to October 26, 2021 for full-text articles written in English. The studies included experimental studies of any duration and design which addressed the effect of Food is Medicine interventions on fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake and glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels among low-income or food-insecure populations with prediabetes or diabetes of any age group. Only direction of effect of interventions on F&V intake were ascertained due to high variability in outcome measurement. A1C results were pooled using generic inverse variance with a fixed-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q and quantified by I2. Results: Sixteen studies were included. Five of the 8 studies reported a significant increase in F&V intake. Seven of the 14 studies reported a significant decrease in A1C levels. A meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (n=843) resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in A1C compared with control (mean difference, −0.47%; 95% confidence interval, −0.66 to −0.29, I2=88%, p<0.0001). Half (n=8) of the studies have a high risk of bias due to missing data, detection bias, and confounding. Conclusions: Food is Medicine interventions are effective in increasing F&V intake and reducing A1C levels of the target population. More randomized controlled studies are needed to validate the results. © 2022 Canadian Diabetes Association"
"Admission of a preterm or sick full-term infant to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a stressful experience for parents. Indeed, the ‘NICU experience’ may constitute a traumatic event for parents, distinct from other birth-related trauma, leading to significant and ongoing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. However, the rates at which this outcome occurs are not well understood. This review aimed to identify the prevalence of PTSD in mothers and fathers of high-risk infants admitted to the NICU, specifically focusing on the NICU experience as the index trauma. The PRISMA-P: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols were used to conduct this review. We searched PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses databases, and reference lists of included articles (1980–2021). Two independent reviewers screened titles and abstracts and conducted the full-text screening assessment. Of the 707 records identified, seven studies met the inclusion criteria. In this systematic review, PTSD symptomatology was assessed by self-report measures rather than a clinical interview. We identified significant variations in the methodologies and quality between studies, with a wide variation of reported prevalence rates of PTSD of 4.5–30% in mothers and 0–33% in fathers. Overall, the findings indicate that up to one-third of parents experience PTSD symptomatology related to the NICU experience. These results emphasize the importance of universal routine antenatal and postnatal screening for symptoms of PTSD to identify parents at risk of distress during the NICU experience and after discharge.

"Although organizational mission is central to social venturing, little is known about the nature and origins of social ventures' missions. In particular, the field lacks a framework for understanding the moral content of nascent ventures' “prosocial” missions that rely on quite different—and potentially conflicting—moral values. We engage in an exploratory study, drawing on moral foundations theory and upper echelons theory to develop framing questions related to the moral discourse in social venture missions and the role of founders' political ideology in relation to this moral discourse. We construct a novel dataset using computer-aided text analysis on the mission statements of over 50,000 nascent nonprofit ventures in the United States, supplemented by voter registration data from 17 states and Washington, D.C. Our findings reveal rich nuance in the moral discourse found in organizations' mission statements. Furthermore, founding teams' political ideologies are strongly associated with the moral discourse in their social ventures' stated missions—and in ways that differ intriguingly from findings in moral psychology at the individual level. We draw on these new insights to develop a roadmap for future research on organizational mission in relation to social venturing, moral markets, mission drift, and political ideology. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to determine sentiment polarities toward specific aspect terms within the same sentence or document. Most recent studies adopted attention-based neural network models to implicitly connect aspect terms with context words. However, these studies were limited by insufficient interaction between aspect terms and opinion words, leading to poor performance on robustness test sets. In addition, we have found that robustness test sets create new sentences that interfere with the original information of a sentence, which often makes the text too long and leads to the problem of long-distance dependence. Simultaneously, these new sentences produce more non-target aspect terms, misleading the model because of the lack of relevant knowledge guidance. This study proposes a knowledge guided multi-granularity graph convolutional neural network (KMGCN) to solve these problems. The multi-granularity attention mechanism is designed to enhance the interaction between aspect terms and opinion words. To address the long-distance dependence, KMGCN uses a graph convolutional network that relies on a semantic map based on fine-tuning pre-trained models. In particular, KMGCN uses a mask mechanism guided by conceptual knowledge to encounter more aspect terms (including target and non-target aspect terms). Experiments are conducted on 12 SemEval-2014 variant benchmarking datasets, and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed framework. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"The main goal of this study is to develop a virtual reality (VR)-based scenario of bullying that is more effective in investigating the motivational factors (i.e., emotion, self-efficacy) of adolescents' bystander behavior than the traditional text method. The second goal is to examine how emotion and defender self-efficacy relate to adolescent bystander behavior. Eighth graders (N = 229) from Taiwan participated in 2 (presentation mode: VR vs. text) x 2 (participant sex: boys vs. girls) x 2 (actor sex: boys vs. girls) experimental trials. The results of MANCOVAs indicated that boys displayed less outsider and pro-bullying behavior in the VR group than in the text group; however, there were no differences in bystander behavior for girls. The subjects in the VR group experienced more fear and excitement, less empathy, and a lower level of defender self-efficacy than those in the text group. The results of regression analyses showed that higher levels of anger and defender self-efficacy significantly predicted positive bystander behavior. Qualitative data revealed that VR provided the subjects with a vivid and realistic bullying experience and enabled them to experience emotions such as anger, empathy, and fear. The findings demonstrate that VR increases students’ antibullying attitudes, justice emotions, and positive bystander behavior. However, VR does not provoke more empathy and self-efficacy, as expected. VR might capture a different dimension of response to bullying than the traditional text method. Nevertheless, VR has promise as an educational tool for developing bystander intervention in high school. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Background: The initial peak incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) occurs during reproductive years. Objectives: Synthesise published literature on the relationship between HL and maternal and perinatal outcomes. Search strategy: Systematic search of PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library, Scopus, Embase and Science Direct from inception to June 2022, supplemented by hand-searching reference lists. Selection criteria: Two reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts and full-text articles. Published studies containing original data were eligible. Data Collection and Analysis: Two reviewers independently extracted data and appraised study quality. Outcomes for pregnant women with a previous/current diagnosis of HL were compared separately with women never diagnosed with HL. Where data permitted, meta-analyses of odds ratios and proportions were performed. Certainty of evidence was determined using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. Main results: Of the 5527 studies identified, 33 met the inclusion criteria. In the groups with HL before pregnancy and HL during pregnancy, adjusted odds ratios were not statistically significant for congenital malformation (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 0.9–3.1, and aOR 1.84, 95% CI 0.81–4.15, respectively), preterm birth (PTB) (aOR 0.99, 95% CI 0.65–1.51, and aOR 6.74, 95% CI 0.52–88.03, respectively) and miscarriage (aOR 0.78, 95% CI 0.55–1.10, and aOR 0.38, 95% CI 0.05–2.72, respectively). The aORs for all other outcomes were not statistically significant, except for blood transfusion (aOR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05–1.82) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) (aOR 7.93, 95% CI 2.97–21.22) in the group for HL during pregnancy. The proportion of anaemia was also increased in this group (69%, 95% CI 57%–80% vs 4%, 95% CI 4%–5%, respectively). The GRADE certainty of findings ranged from low to very low. Conclusions: Rates of most adverse pregnancy outcomes among women with a previous/current HL diagnosis are not increased significantly compared with the general pregnant population. Women with HL diagnosed during pregnancy may have a higher PTB rate and increased likelihood of VTE, anaemia and blood transfusion; however, small study numbers and the low to very low GRADE certainty of findings preclude firm conclusions. © 2022 The Authors.

"Background: The autopsy protocols in the work of the Greco-Roman physician Galen of Pergamum have so far primarily been examined from a literary and socio-historic point of view. An analysis focused on the medical aspects is still incomplete. Objectives: Which pathologic-anatomic competence do the Galenic section reports convey? Materials: The approximately 400 Galenic case histories were examined for anatomic and pathologic statements obtained during dissections of animals and men. Results: In 29 reports, anatomy and pathology issues are addressed. Most section reports can be found in the work On anatomical procedures (De anatomicis administrationibus). The texts do not follow a fixed structure. Galen is always the leading actor, observer, and analyst. Many interventions were performed in front of an audience. Monkeys were by far the most commonly dissected animals. Galen stayed away from little animals, because in his opinion their anatomy was not sufficiently similar to that of men. The post-mortem examination of human corpses with scientific intent was limited to victims of epidemics, armed conflicts, and accidents. Conclusions: The dissection reports cover only part of Galen’s pathologic expertise. The attractive public opening of animals earned him a large part of his reputation as a scientifically oriented physician. The dissection reports are an essential part of the collection of Galen’s case histories and provide important detailed information on the history of anatomy and pathology in late antiquity. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature."
"This work comprehensively investigates the self-heating effects (SHEs) in Tree-FET at 5nm technological nodes. A comparative analysis of Tree-FET with Nanosheet FET (NSFET) shows that the Tree-FET (3-channel+2-bridge) is more or less comparable to the 5-channel NSFET rather than with 3-channel NSFET. An in-depth physics-based study shows that considering only one aspect of increasing ON current is insufficient to judge Tree-FETs for future technological nodes. Targeting these facts, device reliability is demonstrated through numerical simulations showing that Tree-FET outperforms in a self-heating situation, which is a prime concern at a lower technology node. 5-channel NSFET shows $\sim {\textbf {24}}\%$ reduction while Tree-FET ( $\text{H}_{\textbf {IB}}\,\,=$ 25nm) shows only $\sim \textbf {20}\%$ reduction in $I_{\textbf {ON}}$ under self-heating. This is because the bridges create a path to heat removal through electrodes and substrate. The peak temperature difference between channels is $\sim \textbf {23K}$ in Tree-FET, whereas, in the case of other counterparts, it is $\sim \textbf {28K}$. A comparatively smaller variation in the $\text{V}_{\textbf {T}}$ shift due to the self-heating effect is observed in Tree-FET in order to achieve higher $I_{\textbf {ON}}$ , showing a promising candidate for circuitry that requires a high drive current. A comparative lower gate capacitance implies that Tree-FET may perform well in digital switching applications. Though Tree-FET is not comparable to NSFET for analog applications due to lesser intrinsic gain, it shows a lesser degradation in cut-off frequency $(\sim \textbf {3}\%$ ) compared to 5-channel NSFET under a self-heating environment.  © 2001-2011 IEEE."
"Basic knowledge of biochemistry underpins oral and dental care. Undergraduate dental students do not always engage well with basic science teaching due to not appreciating its clinical relevance. Co-teaching provides one approach to overcome students' disengagement and involves two lecturers, with complementary expertise, presenting the curriculum together. This study investigated student experiences and engagement using co-teaching to integrate biochemistry with clinical sciences in the students' second-year dental curriculum. Two successive second year dental student cohorts were co-taught. Content was delivered by a biochemist and an oral biologist, either online (during the 2020 COVID lockdown) or in-person (2021). Each cohort was surveyed at the end of the teaching module using an online questionnaire containing both interval scale and free-text questions. Responses were received from 39 (42%) and 64 (85%) of students in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Students from both cohorts preferred the co-teaching approach with a mean of 8.74 on a 10-point interval scale. In 2020 and 2021, 77% and 76% of participants, respectively, preferred a combined biochemistry and clinical dentistry delivery, either in-person (37%), via Zoom (19%) or via video recording (14%). Thematic analysis of responses revealed students experienced enhanced engagement when co-taught and they attributed this to integration of the curriculum making the content more relevant and stimulating. Students preferred co-teaching to individual subjects being taught by a single teacher. Co-teaching established the relevance of theoretical biochemistry to clinical dental sciences and enhanced the students' learning experience. © 2022 The Authors.

"Objective: Research has shown that therapists can develop a positive therapeutic relationship in the Internet setting and that the therapeutic relationship plays a role in treatment outcome. However, little is known about how therapists foster a positive therapeutic relationship in the Internet setting. Therefore, the current study assesses the extent to which therapists apply techniques that are recommended in the face-to-face setting when communicating with participants of an Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) intervention. Method: Qualitative content analysis was conducted to analyse therapists' messages sent to clients during the course of an asynchronous, text-based iCBT intervention for caregivers of people with dementia. A total of 216 written messages from four therapists to 27 participants were analysed. Based on the motivational attunement framework of therapist behaviour, a deductive coding system was developed, and the intercoder reliability was satisfactory. Results: Through qualitative content analysis, a variety of techniques were found in the therapeutic messages: 12 main categories and six subcategories of therapeutic techniques that satisfy the four basic needs according to Grawe were identified. Therapists most frequently addressed the need for attachment (41%), followed by orientation and control (28%), self-esteem (24%) and pleasure (7%). Conclusions: The results indicated that online therapists implemented many of the techniques that are recommended and applied in the face-to-face setting to foster a positive therapeutic relationship. Results can be used to develop training for online therapists and manuals for Internet interventions. © 2022 The Authors.

"This study demonstrates a way of bringing an innovative data source, social media information, to the government accounting information systems to support accountability to stakeholders and managerial decision-making. Future accounting and auditing processes will heavily rely on multiple forms of exogenous data. As an example of the techniques that could be used to generate this needed information, the study applies text mining techniques and machine learning algorithms to Twitter data. The information is developed as an alternative performance measure for NYC street cleanliness. It utilizes Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost to classify the tweets, illustrates how to use the sampling method to solve the imbalanced class distribution issue, and uses VADER sentiment to derive the public opinion about street cleanliness. This study also extends the research to another social media platform, Facebook, and finds that the incremental value is different between the two social media platforms. This data can then be linked to government accounting information systems to evaluate costs and provide a better understanding of the efficiency and effectiveness of operations. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Recent guidelines have produced a consensus statement for perioperative care in hip and knee replacement. However, there is still a need for reanalysis of the evidence and recommendations. Therefore, we retrieved and reanalyzed the evidence of each recommended components of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) based on the guidelines of total joint arthroplasty. For each one, we included for the highest levels of evidence and those systematic reviews and meta-analyses were preferred. The full texts were analyzed and the evidence of all components were summarized. We found that most of the recommended components of ERAS are supported by evidence, however, the implementation details of each recommended components need to be further optimized. Therefore, implementation of a full ERAS program may maximize the benefits of our clinical practice but this combined effect still needs to be further determined. © 2023 The Authors.

"In recent decades, many researchers set out to draw links between Western anarchism and ancient Chinese Daoism. The present work aims at adding to this ongoing debate by answering the question of whether the Guodian Laozi’s 郭店老子 sayings can be labelled as “anarchism.” It defends the claim that the text endorses a unique kind of anarchist theory based on a distinctive theory of political authority grounded in Daoist moral commitments. To do so, this essay first offers an overview of the scholarly debate surrounding this topic. Second, it provides an account of the necessary and sufficient feature any theory must secure in order to be argued to be anarchist, as well as a framework that underlines potential differences between various anarchist theories. Third, a rigorous textual analysis of the Guodian Laozi is conducted to extrapolate its political advice, before analyzing it in light of the anarchist framework mentioned above. This essay concludes with an assessment of several objections that may be raised against its claims. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Exploring the factors that affect the market performance of paid knowledge products is of great importance for knowledge payment platforms. Drawing on the sensations-familiarity framework and social capital theory, this study investigates how knowledge differentiation between paid and free knowledge impacts market performance, along with the moderating effect of knowledge providers’ social capital. Technically, a neural network-based text mining model is utilized to transform free and paid knowledge to semantic vectors, whose dissimilarity is calculated as knowledge differentiation. Empirical analysis on a real dataset reveals the positive (or negative) effect of knowledge differentiation on sales (or eWOM, electronic word of mouth), which will be more prominent with the increase of social capital. The results are reinforced with robustness checks regarding alternative knowledge-differentiation measures, more control variables and alternative regression methods. The present study extends our understanding of knowledge payment and free-to-paid consumption, and offers practical implications for content design and product management. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Objective: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of different ultrasound signs for diagnosing adnexal torsion, using surgery as the reference standard. Methods: This was a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies published between January 1990 and November 2021 evaluating ovarian edema, adnexal mass, ovarian Doppler flow findings, the whirlpool sign and pelvic fluid as ultrasound signs (index tests) for detecting adnexal torsion, using surgical findings as the reference standard. The search for studies was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, ClinicalTrials.gov and Web of Science databases. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool was used to evaluate the quality of the studies. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios were calculated separately, and the post-test probability of adnexal torsion following a positive or negative test was also determined. Results: The search identified 1267 citations after excluding duplicates. Eighteen studies were ultimately included in the qualitative and quantitative syntheses. Eight studies (809 patients) analyzed the presence of ovarian edema, eight studies (1044 patients) analyzed the presence of an adnexal mass, 14 studies (1742 patients) analyzed ovarian Doppler flow, six studies (545 patients) analyzed the whirlpool sign and seven studies (981 patients) analyzed the presence of pelvic fluid as ultrasound signs of adnexal torsion. Overall, the quality of most studies was considered to be moderate or good. However, there was a high risk of bias in the patient-selection and index-text domains (with the exception of the whirlpool sign) in a significant proportion of studies. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of each ultrasound sign were 58%, 86%, 4.0 and 0.49 for ovarian edema, 69%, 46%, 1.3 and 0.67 for adnexal mass, 65%, 91%, 7.6 and 0.38 for the whirlpool sign, 53%, 95%, 11.0 and 0.49 for ovarian Doppler findings and 55%, 69%, 1.7 and 0.66 for pelvic fluid. Heterogeneity was high for all analyses. Conclusions: The presence of an adnexal mass or pelvic fluid have poor diagnostic accuracy as ultrasound signs of adnexal torsion, while the presence of ovarian edema, the whirlpool sign and decreased or absent ovarian Doppler flow have good specificity but moderate sensitivity for detecting adnexal torsion. © 2022 The Authors.

"Not all hope is equal. For the Christian religion, hope is a theological virtue, and refers to the expectation of future life, beyond death. With the transformation of European society in a secular sense and the rise of individualism between the 17th and 18th centuries, hope becomes a program of political and social transformation, aimed at this world. In my contribution I trace the emergence of the concept of hope in social thought and, then, in sociology. My analysis begins with the Philosophie sociale (Paris, 1793) by Moses Dobruska (1753–1794), a pioneering and largely overlooked text that founds a new vision of social science. After Dobruska, I then devote my attention to the great thinkers of the early nineteenth century, Henri de Saint-Simon (1760–1825) and Auguste Comte (1798–1857), and then I move on to the work of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917). It is a historical perspective that has been neglected until now, and that allows us to appreciate the construction of an idea of hope that frees itself from religious determinants and is oriented toward society and the individuals who live in it, and that anticipates the utopias and failures of the social ideologies of the 20th century. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Project construction on-site is known to be very dangerous workplace environments due to large numbers of safety hazards. Analysis of construction safety hazards is essential to formulate rational safety management plans and prevent accidents. Construction documents contain large volumes of safety hazard information available for analysis. However, such analyses are challenging because the safety hazard information in the construction documents is presented in an unstructured or semi-structured format. This study proposes a method for intelligent mining of safety hazard information, which comprises safety hazard technical term recognition and safety hazard information analysis. The safety hazard technical term recognition model is developed based on semantic similarity and information correlation to build a safety hazard technical term library. The safety hazard information based on the technical term library is mined and analyzed using the term frequency-inverse document frequency method (TF-IDF). Finally, the proposed method is applied to build the safety hazard technical term library, which contains 2697 technical terms, and develop a hydraulic project construction safety hazard analysis system, which can realize the intelligent recognition and application of technical terms. Meanwhile, this system can automatically extract safety hazard information and provide a visualization interface to intuitively show the safety hazard analysis results, which improves the extraction efficiency of safety hazard information. The study provides a new approach for recognizing technical terms and mining safety hazard information, which can lead to enhancing management efficiency and practical knowledge discovery for safety management. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Aims: The NHS England Radiotherapy Service Specification calls for routine use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). However, barriers exist at patient, healthcare professional and service levels. The aim of the present study was to determine the current use of PROMs within radiotherapy services in England. The current attitudes, barriers and enablers to the implementation of PROMs in radiotherapy practice were evaluated and practical recommendations to inform future implementation were developed. Materials and methods: A mixed-methods approach was adopted to obtain quantitative and qualitative data. An online questionnaire was developed and disseminated to all radiotherapy operational delivery network managers across England. The questionnaire consisted of 12 open and closed questions relating to PROMs use, with the option to provide free-text responses. Inductive thematic analysis was conducted on free-text comments, whereas descriptive statistics were used to analyse quantitative data. Results: In total, 182 responses were received from 40 of the 50 radiotherapy providers, resulting in a response rate of 84%. The current use of PROMs was analysed, including rationale for use, tools used, format of PROMs collection and timing within the radiotherapy pathway. Most respondents indicated that PROMs were used in the context of clinical trials only. Through thematic analysis, four identical key themes were identified relating to both barriers and enablers to PROMs use; these included IT infrastructure, time, human/financial resources and training/education. A fifth theme, standardisation, was identified as a key enabler to PROMs use. Conclusions: Our findings show that outside of clinical trials, PROMs are not routinely used in radiotherapy services due to barriers identified at professional and service levels. Here we provide recommendations to mitigate the barriers identified and implement PROMs in radiotherapy, including training for healthcare professionals and standardisation of PROMs tools and storage. This study provides a key first step in driving PROMs implementation within radiotherapy services across England. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"Value-at-risk (VAR) is an indispensable part of a disaster risk assessment of historical buildings. Indicator-based value framework can provide a consistent and comparative method to assess the VAR of historical buildings. However, the existing value frameworks and their indicators are diverse, greatly due to the multidimensional characteristic of the value of historical buildings. Besides, there are various value indicators that existing frameworks do not encompass. As such, a holistic framework to assess the VAR of historical buildings is still needed. Establishing a holistic VAR framework requires a detailed review of existing value frameworks and indicators to understand their similarities and differences. Therefore, a review of existing value frameworks and indicators is presented, covering frameworks and indicators applicable to three categories of built cultural heritage (historical buildings, monuments, and archaeological sites) reported in literature, as well as guidelines and reports. The review summarizes 53 value indicators and 12 frameworks, and after integration, reorganization, and optimization, a novel holistic VAR framework, with 6 first-level indicators and 42 second-level indicators, has been proposed for VAR assessment of historical buildings using the analytic hierarchy process based on expert elicitation. Further, the proposed VAR framework has been verified by performing a text mining analysis of the definitions/descriptions of the value indicators. Two historical buildings in China were analyzed to demonstrate the universality and comprehensiveness of the proposed VAR framework. The VAR assessment results can provide reference on safety measures allocation for risk reduction of historical buildings.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers."
"The ways in which news media communicate about heatwaves can influence how society conceptualises and addresses heatwave risks. We examined visual news coverage of the 2019 heatwaves in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK, using content and visual critical discourse analyses. Many visuals were positively valenced (in contrast to article texts), framing heatwaves as ‘fun in the sun’. The most prevalent type of images in all countries were photographs of people having fun in or by water. When images did depict the danger of heat extremes, people were largely absent. We conclude that this visual framing of heatwaves is problematic: first, by displacing concerns of vulnerability, it marginalises the experiences of those vulnerable to heatwaves; and second, it excludes opportunities for imagining a more resilient future. We conclude with suggestions to diversify the visual discourse on climate change and heatwaves in the news media.

"Unlike the central banks of most developed economies, the People's Bank of China (PBC) does not release its macroeconomic forecasts to the public but instead carries out narrative communication. We apply a hurdle distributed multinomial regression to PBC communication texts in real time, addressing the ultrahigh dimensionality, sparsity, and look-ahead biases. In addition, we embed text-based indices into mixed-data sampling (MIDAS)-type models and conduct forecast combinations for prediction. Our results argue that the predictive information from communication texts improves the real-time out-of-sample prediction performance. We connect textual analysis and real-time macroeconomic projection, providing new insights into the value of central bank communication. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Text simplification (TS) is the process of generating easy-to-understand sentences from a given sentence or piece of text. The aim of TS is to reduce both the lexical (which refers to vocabulary complexity and meaning) and syntactic (which refers to the sentence structure) complexity of a given text or sentence without the loss of meaning or nuance. In this paper, we present SimpLex, a novel simplification architecture for generating simplified English sentences. To generate a simplified sentence, the proposed architecture uses either word embeddings (i.e., Word2Vec) and perplexity, or sentence transformers (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT2) and cosine similarity. The solution is incorporated into a user-friendly and simple-to-use software. We evaluate our system using two metrics, i.e., SARI and Perplexity Decrease. Experimentally, we observe that the transformer models outperform the other models in terms of the SARI score. However, in terms of perplexity, the word embedding-based models achieve the biggest decrease.

"The graphene-based materials are promising for applications in supercapacitors and other energy storage devices due to the intriguing properties, i.e., highly tunable surface area, outstanding electrical conductivity, good chemical stability, and excellent mechanical behavior. This review summarizes recent development on graphene-based materials for supercapacitor electrodes, based on their macrostructural complexity, i.e., zero-dimensional (0D) (e.g., free-standing graphene dots and particles), one-dimensional (1D) (e.g., fiber-type and yarn-type structures), two-dimensional (2D) (e.g., graphenes and graphene-based nanocomposite films), and three-dimensional (3D) (e.g., graphene foam and hydrogel-based nanocomposites). There are extensive and on-going researches on the rationalization of their structures at varying scales and dimensions, development of effective and low-cost synthesis techniques, design and architecturing of graphene-based materials, as well as clarification of their electrochemical performance. There are several methods for producing graphene, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Graphene-based materials have great potential to be employed in supercapacitors due to their unique two-dimensional structure and inherent physical properties like excellent electrical conductivity and large area. This text summarizes recent developments within the sector of supercapacitors, including double-layer capacitors and quasi-capacitors. The pros and cons of using them in supercapacitors are discussed. Compared to traditional electrodes, graphene-based materials show some new properties and mechanisms within the method of energy storage and release. During this paper, we briefly describe carbon structures, particularly graphene, and also the history of graphene discovery, and briefly describe the synthesis methods, properties, characterization methods, and applications of graphene. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"With the flare-up of the COVID-19 infection since 2020, COVID-19 has been one of the hottest topics on Twitter. Topic modeling is one of the most popular analyses, which extracts the topics from the text. This paper proposes a method to extract the most-discussed topics for 32 countries of the world. In this regard, more than five million related tweets have been studied, and a method based on content analysis is proposed to identify the exact location of each tweet. Then, by using the statistical algorithm of Latent Dirichlet Allocation, the main topics of the tweets are identified. By leveraging sentiment analysis, the topics are afterward divided into positive and negative groups, and their trends in a quarterly period are investigated for the countries under study. The outcome of the analysis of time trends shows that for most countries, the trend of negative topics is highly correlated with the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"The purpose of this paper is to study how people use texts and languages to interpret or make sense of the COVID-19 pandemic. We draw on the theoretical literature of framing perspectives to formulate our arguments that consider the virus a socially constructed reality. We use Taiwan as an empirical case study, using topic modeling analysis of newspaper articles. Our findings show that the language of the COVID-19 coverage combines the four frames of political evaluation, economic impact, biomedical science and social life in varying proportions. These frames are subject to changes in pandemic conditions. Implications for theory and practice are presented. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Purpose: Literature reports of adverse drug events can be replicated across multiple companies, resulting in extreme duplication (defined as a majority of reports being duplicates) in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database because they can escape legacy duplicate detection algorithms routinely deployed on that data source. Literature reference field, added to in 2014, could potentially be utilized to identify replicated reports. FAERS does not enforce adherence to the Vancouver referencing convention, thus the same article may be referenced differently leading to duplication. The objective of this analysis is to determine if variations of the same literature references observed in FAERS can be resolved with text normalization and fuzzy string matching. Methods: We normalized the literature references recorded in the FAERS database through the first quarter of 2021 with a rule-based algorithm so that they better conform to the Vancouver convention. Levenshtein distance was then utilized to merge sufficiently similar normalized literature references together. Results: Normalization of literature references increases the percentage that can be parsed into author, title, and journal from 61.74% to 93.93%. We observe that about 98% of pairs within groups do have a Levenshtein similarity of the title above the threshold. The extreme duplication ranged from 66% to 87% with a median of 72% of reports being duplicates and often involved addictovigilance scenarios. Conclusions: We have shown that these normalized references can be merged via fuzzy string matching to improve enumeration of all the individual case safety reports that refer to the same article. Inclusion of the PubMed ID and adherence to the Vancouver convention could facilitate identification of duplicates in the FAERS dataset. Awareness of this phenomenon may improve disproportionality analysis, especially in areas such as addictovigilance. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Social media users are increasingly turning to express opinions with both images and text, while the visual content and text description may cover some conflicting information diverse from each other. Information relevance refers to the matching degree between cross-modal features at the emotional semantic level, which is not systematically studied. In order to exploit the discriminative features and the internal correlation among different modalities, the mid-level representation extracted by a visual sentiment concept classifier is used to determine information relevance, with the integration of other features, including attended textual and visual features. Then grid search is applied to tune weighting coefficients of the decision fusion scheme, followed by a multimodal adaptive method for joint sentiment analysis based on image-text relevance. The superiority of our architecture approach is demonstrated experimentally by comparing it with several state-of-the-art baselines, such as the vision-aware language modeling approach and contrastive learning-based model. The results indicate that fused multiple features lead to more precise classification than unimodal ones, while the contributions of each single modality differ obviously in emotional expression. Besides, the performance of every involved model varies markedly per dataset of different content correlation, which proves that it is of extensive theoretical significance and application prospect to introduce the image-text relevance classifier into a multimodal task. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Occupational incidents are a major concern in steel industries due to the complex nature of job activities. Forecasting incidents caused by various activities and determining the root cause might aid in implementing appropriate interventions. Thus, the purpose of this study is to investigate the future trend and identify the pattern of contributing factors of incident occurrences. The study focuses on an integrated steel plant where different steel-making-related operations are carried out in separate units. The incident data of 45 months is used. Initially, a unit-wise trend of incidents (e.g., injury, near-miss and property damage) is forecasted using the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to determine the near-future incident trends and to identify the most incident-prone unit of the plant. The model is validated using six-month holdout data, and the predicted number of incidents is compared with the actual counts. The ARIMA model indicates that the safety performance of the iron making unit is found to be underperforming. In the second phase, meaningful association rules are extracted from text data using the apriori algorithm for the underperforming unit to discover the incident-causing factors. Results from text mining-based association mining suggest that bike and car-related incidents are the leading causes of injury. Similarly, gas leakage, slag spillage, and coke-oven door malfunctioning are causing near-miss incidents. The majority of property damage incidents are reported due to derailment, loading/ unloading and dashing of the dumper vehicle. Effective implementation of the study's specified rules can aid plant administration in formulating policies to improve safety performance by designing focused interventions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"The carbon market relies on market-oriented financial means to solve the problem of carbon emissions. An effective carbon pricing mechanism can improve market efficiency and better serve the implementation of carbon emission reduction. The limited attention of investors increases the uncertainty of carbon market volatility and is an important exogenous factor affecting the price of carbon assets. This study innovatively mines keywords of investor attention on the carbon market through online news texts and eliminates those that have no causal link to carbon price forecasting in order to reduce noise. The results show that the keyword extraction method based on news text mining is better than that of nontext mining. Meanwhile, a carbon price forecasting model based on a particle-swarm-optimization LSTM model structure is constructed, and the forecasting accuracy is improved. The results show that carbon market investors pay more attention to carbon quota supply and demand, carbon prices, environmental change, and the energy market. The results have important implications for the development of effective carbon market policies and risk management. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"The increasing interest around emotions in online texts creates the demand for financial sentiment analysis. Previous studies mainly focus on coarse-grained document-/sentence-level sentiment analysis, which ignores different sentiment polarities of various targets (e.g., company entities) in a sentence. To fill the gap, from a fine-grained target-level perspective, we propose a novel Lexicon Enhanced Collaborative Network (LECN) for targeted sentiment analysis (TSA) in financial texts. In general, the model designs a unified and collaborative framework that can capture the associations of targets and sentiment cues to enhance the overall performance of TSA. Moreover, the model dynamically incorporates sentiment lexicons to guide the sentiment classification, which cultivates the model faculty of understanding financial expressions. In addition, the model introduces a message selective-passing mechanism to adaptively control the information flow between two tasks, thereby improving the collaborative effects. To verify the effectiveness of LECN, we conduct experiments on four financial datasets, including SemEVAL2017 Task5 subset1, SemEVAL2017 Task5 subset2, FiQA 2018 Task1, and Financial PhraseBank. Results show that LECN achieves improvements over the state-of-art baseline by 1.66 p.p., 1.47 p.p., 1.94 p.p., and 1.88 p.p. in terms of F1-score. A series of further analyses also indicate that LECN has a better capacity for comprehending domain-specific expressions and can achieve the mutually beneficial effect between tasks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Nowadays, fake news has turned into a major problem because of the negative impact that it creates on society. Social media allows people to spread information on the internet with slight investigations and to add fewer filters than the actual content. Nowadays, the false news in the internet community is unsure, and it creates a wrong impression among the users. Detecting false news has become a critical task based on shared content. To tackle the false news growth in social media, various automatic detection schemes were evaluated. The “Natural Language Processing (NLP)” method also gives a prominent solution for false news detection. The main intention of this paper is to design and introduce an innovative false news recognition method using Meta-heuristic Searched-Ensemble Learning (MS-EL). Further, the selected features are extracted by the “Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)” and also Word2vec features. Here, the extracted selected features are integrated with the Hybrid Squirrel–Dragonfly Search Optimization (HS-DSO) is used to optimize the weighted feature selection approach with the fitness function of solving data variance and correlation. The proposed MS-EL is adopted in the classification part, having three sets of classifiers, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Here, the ensemble classifier is enhanced by the same HS-DSO that shows the parameter tuning with a high convergence rate. From the experimental outcomes, the accuracy of HS-DSO-MS-EL is 22% higher than BMO-MS-EL, 24% higher than SP-BMO-MS-EL, 30% higher than SSA-MS-EL, and 29% higher than DA-MS-EL. Thus, the experimental analysis with standard datasets establishes that the introduced fake news detection method has gained higher accuracy than the existing models. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Digitalization has affected working practices in the field of public relations over the past two decades. Consequently, the skills and competences that are expected from public relations professionals are theorized to have undergone stark changes, with obvious implications for educators, role perceptions, and the professionals themselves. Job postings provide information about these changes by describing the skills employers expect and desire from applicants. To date, only a few studies have used this source of information, and these mostly concern the U.S. market using small samples of job postings. The purpose of this study is to enrich our understanding of how digitalization has impacted the skillsets required of public relations practitioners through the longitudinal automated semantic analysis of 62,391 public relations job postings published in Austria and Germany between 2015 and 2020. The analysis shows an increase in the number of hard skills demanded in PR in this region over the past five years. This change is particularly pronounced with respect to digital skills, thus underlining the importance of digitalization in public relations. The detailed and up-to-date findings describing what the job market is currently looking for and how it is changing will be useful for educators in developing and aligning PR curricula and advanced training programmes. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Introduction: Melanoma is the fifth most common cancer diagnosed in the United States, representing 5.6% of all new cancer cases. There are conflicting reports correlating a relationship between primarily outdoor occupations, associated with increased exposure to direct sunlight, and the incidence of cutaneous melanoma. Our objective was to outline and critically evaluate the relevant literature related to chronic occupational exposure to sunlight and risk of developing cutaneous melanoma. Methods: The study protocol for this systematic review was submitted to the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. For each relevant study included, the following information was extracted: author names, publication year, study name, study design, age, exposure assessment, outcome, comparison, number of cases, case ascertainment, and descriptive and adjusted statistics. Study quality and evidence certainty was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations model. Results: The initial database search yielded 1629 articles for review and following full-text screening, a total of 14 articles were included for final analysis. Of the studies included, seven articles were retrospective case control and seven were cohort studies. The studies did not report any differences in the likelihood of cutaneous melanoma development based upon membership in the outdoor versus indoor occupation groups included in each study. Conclusions: Overall, the articles included in this systematic review did not report an increased risk of developing cutaneous melanoma among individuals with outdoor occupations. Further investigation is required to determine if other occupational or life-style–related risk factors exist, to help support the development of individualized skin screening recommendations and improve the early detection of melanoma in all populations. © 2022"
"Researchers have been aware that emotion is not one-hot encoded in emotion-relevant classification tasks, and multiple emotions can coexist in a given sentence. Recently, several works have focused on leveraging a distribution label or a grayscale label of emotions in the classification model, which can enhance the one-hot label with additional information, such as the intensity of other emotions and the correlation between emotions. Such an approach has been proven effective in alleviating the overfitting problem and improving the model robustness by introducing a distribution learning component in the objective function. However, the effect of distribution learning cannot be fully unfolded as it can reduce the model's discriminative ability within similar emotion categories. For example, “Sad” and “Fear” are both negative emotions. To address such a problem, we proposed a novel emotion extension scheme in the prior work (Li, Chen, Xie, Li, and Tao, 2021). The prior work incorporated fine-grained emotion concepts to build an extended label space, where a mapping function between coarse-grained emotion categories and fine-grained emotion concepts was identified. For example, sentences labeled “Joy” can convey various emotions such as enjoy, free, and leisure. The model can further benefit from the extended space by extracting dependency within fine-grained emotions when yielding predictions in the original label space. The prior work has shown that it is more apt to apply distribution learning in the extended label space than in the original space. A novel sparse connection method, i.e., Leaky Dropout, is proposed in this paper to refine the dependency-extraction step, which further improves the classification performance. In addition to the multiclass emotion classification task, we extensively experimented on sentiment analysis and multilabel emotion prediction tasks to investigate the effectiveness and generality of the label extension schema. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"Urban underground 3D geological modeling can accurately express various geological phenomena and provide a decision-making basis for urban planning and geological analysis. The construction of smart cities has put forward new requirements for the automation and intelligence of urban geological 3D modeling. Geological survey reports are important reference data for urban geological 3D modeling. However, a large number of geological maps, geophysical data, and other geographic quantitative data of geological science surveys have been buried in geological survey literature and have not been effectively used. Currently, the development of data mining and information extraction technology provides the possibility to integrate these data into 3D geological modeling. Therefore, this study designed the workflow of 3D geological modeling using a geological survey report. First, after the geological survey report was deconstructed, the geological text information was recognized and extracted using geological dictionary matching and pattern rule matching, and the integration of knowledge was provided in the form of a knowledge graph. Then, the drilling information and table data in the drilling histogram are automatically extracted. Through these methods, the unstructured geological survey report can be transformed into structured data and integrated into the 3D geological modeling process. Finally, the 3D geological modeling of the Bridge Group in Jinan based on the Jinan urban geological survey report was taken as an example to verify the feasibility of the proposed method and demonstrate the potential of text mining and information extraction of geological survey reports for 3D geological modeling, which provides geological data support for the transformation of old and new kinetic energy and the construction of major projects of government departments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"This article is concerned with ""abstract rhetors"", i.e. inanimate nouns used as subjects of active verbs, in Polish and English academic texts. The few existing studies that deal with abstract rhetors in Polish indicate that their use is limited in comparison with English in both quantitative and qualitative terms. However, no suggestions have been offered so far as to the potential factors that may underlie these limitations, especially with regard to the qualitative differences. Focusing on a special type of abstract rhetors, namely active verbs used with text-denoting subjects, the article offers a comparable corpus-based analysis of Polish and English abstracts of research articles in linguistics with a view to determining their frequencies and shedding some light on the possible causes of the limited use of the structure in Polish. The results show that the use of active verbs with nouns referring to the abstracted article or its part is more than twice less frequent in Polish than in English, with considerable differences between the types of verbs employed in such contexts in the two languages. Three factors are proposed as potentially affecting the compatibility of the Polish verb with an inanimate, text-denoting noun: the type of agency, the supported metaphor/metonymy for the research article, and verb aspect/telicity.  © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"The online depression community (ODC) has become a popular resource for people with depression to manage their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study proposed a novel perspective based on response style theory to investigate whether depression individuals’ distractive and ruminative behaviors in ODC were related to social support received and co-rumination. Furthermore, we explored the influences of social support and co-rumination on suicidal behaviors using panel data set. We collected text data from 22,286 depressed users of a large ODC in China from March 2020 to July 2021, and conducted text mining and econometrics analyses to test our research questions. The results showed that depression users’ online ruminative behaviors had a positive relationship with the co-rumination and had a negative relationship with social support received. Besides, constructive distractive behaviors (i.e., providing social support to others) increased the support users received from others but had a negative relationship with co-rumination. Depression users' future suicidal behaviors are influenced by past received social support and co-rumination. The received social supports and co-rumination have a negative and positive influence on depression users' future suicidal behaviors, respectively. Our results enrich the application of response style theory in online medicine. They provide meaningful insights into behaviors that influence the acquisition of online social support and the incidence of online co-rumination in ODCs. This study helps relevant institutions to conduct more targeted online suicide interventions for depression patients. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Progression in the popularity of social media activities had provided huge amount of data in the form of text that can immeasurably augment its specialty. This textual data offers a platform for the reviewers to share their comments about any product, service or event on social media. These types of discussions among the reviewers boost the demand and supply in business and industry field. Furthermore, for every passing day the textual data is also increasing in amount which makes data mining especially sentiment analysis or opinion mining, a research hungry area. This is mainly because of data is represented in the form of calculations about reviewers’ comments, assessment, attitudes, behavior and emotions to individual issues, events, topics, services and attributes. Previously, researchers focus on systems to recognize and categorize sentiments from the written material where opinions are extremely unstructured, assorted and classified. In this paper, authors try to presents a meticulous survey on sentiment analysis with classification, in which one hundred and forty three articles were reviewed regarding important activities, approaches, applications with multilingual and cross domain jobs. This systematic survey considers published literature during 2010-2021, organized based on machine learning, lexicon and hybrid approaches with multilingual and cross domain knowledge. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."

"Background: Gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) is the fifth most common cancer in the world, and the presence of germline pathogenic variants has been linked with approximately 5% of gastric cancer diagnoses. Multiple GAC susceptibility genes have been identified, but information regarding the risk associated with pathogenic variants in these genes remains obscure. We conducted a systematic review of existing studies reporting the penetrance of GAC susceptibility genes. Methods: A structured search query was devised to identify GAC-related papers indexed in MEDLINE/PubMed. A semi-automated natural language processing algorithm was applied to identify penetrance papers for inclusion. Original studies reporting the penetrance of GAC were included and the full-text articles were independently reviewed. Summary statistics, effect estimates, and precision parameters from these studies were compiled into a table using a predetermined format to ensure consistency. Results: Forty-five studies were identified reporting the penetrance of GAC among patients harboring mutations in 13 different genes: APC, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, CHEK2, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, MUTYH-Monoallelic, NBN, and STK11. Conclusion: Our systematic review highlights the importance of testing for germline pathogenic variants in patients before the development of GAC. Management of patients who harbor a pathogenic mutation is multifactorial, and clinicians should consider cancer risk for each applicable gene–cancer association throughout the screening and management process. The scarcity of studies we found investigating the risk of GAC among patients with pathogenic variants in GAC susceptibility genes highlights the need for more investigations that focus on producing robust risk estimates for gene–cancer associations. © 2022, Society of Surgical Oncology."
"Objective: To determine if lung sonography is accurate in assessing and confirming pulmonary compromise and thereby reduce the risk of x-ray exposure, for pediatric patients. Materials and Methods: This study was a systematic review of individual published studies. PubMed was the only database used for the article search. A review by a committee of contributors determined whether studies met the specific inclusion criteria. Studies reviewed had participants between the ages 0 and 18 years, with lung compromise of varying pathophysiological diagnoses. Each intervention was coded by levels of evidence; grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE); the evidence alert traffic light grading system; and risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions. Each article was evaluated using the Cochrane assessment of bias and GRADE evidence tables. Results: Thirty-seven articles were retrieved. Of those, 21 articles were removed following title and abstract screening. With 16 articles remaining, only one duplicate was removed. Based on the 15 articles extracted, in full-text versions, only two articles were noted to be irrelevant, and one article was not provided in English. Only 12 articles met the eligibility criteria, but two articles had to be removed because they were systematic reviews and not individual studies. The final analysis was based on 10 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Conclusion: Once reviewed, all 10 articles indicated that lung sonography had high accuracy and confirmation of lung compromise, which spanned multiple pulmonary diagnoses, in pediatric patients. When used by a trained clinician, lung sonography was as highly effective in comparison to other diagnostic tools, such as a chest radiograph and computed tomography. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Background: Mainstream economic evaluations methods may not be appropriate to capture the range of effects triggered by interventions for people with intellectual disabilities. In this systematic review, we aimed to identify, assess and synthesise the arguments in the literature on how the effects of interventions for people with intellectual disabilities could be measured in economic evaluations. Method: We searched for studies providing relevant arguments by running multi-database, backward, forward citation and grey literature searches. Following title/abstract and full-text screening, the arguments extracted from the included studies were summarised and qualitatively assessed in a narrative synthesis. Results: Our final analysis included three studies, with their arguments summarised in different methodological areas. Conclusions: Based on the evidence, we suggest the use of techniques more attuned to the population with intellectual disabilities, such sensitive preference-based instruments to collect health states data, and mapping algorithms to obtain utility values. © 2022 The Authors.

"The replies of people seeking support in online mental health communities can be analyzed to discover if they feel better after receiving support; feeling better indicates a cognitive change. Most research uses key phrase matching and word frequency statistics to identify psychological cognitive change, methods that result in omissions and inaccuracy. This study constructs an intelligent method for identifying psychological cognitive change based on natural language processing technology. It incorporates information related to emotions that appears in reply text to help identify whether psychological cognitive change has occurred. The model first encodes the emotion information based on rule matching and manual annotation, then adds the encoded emotion lexicon and a cognitive change lexicon to a word2vec high-dimensional semantic word vector training, converts the annotated cognitive change recognition text into a vector matrix using the trained model, and train in the annotated text using TextCNN. To compare the results with those of the traditional methods (key phrase matching and sentiment word frequency statistics), this study uses a semi-automated approach to construct a lexicon of psychological cognitive change, as well as a keyword lexicon without cognitive change, based on word vectors and similarity. We compare the performance of the classifier before and after the fusion of the graphical emotion information, compare the LSTM and Transformer as baselines, and compare traditional word frequency statistics methods. The experimental results show that our proposed classification model performs better than the others; it achieves 84.38% precision, an 84.09% recall rate, and an 84.17% F1 value. Our work bears methodological implications for online mental health platforms. © 2022"
"Industry 4.0 is an important contributor to industrial innovation and sustainability. Nevertheless, few studies empirically analyse how it acts as a binding force of both business practices. This study examines 1501 sustainability reports using a mixed human-artificial intelligence method based on Python's text mining libraries. This method takes advantage of AI's capabilities to extract information from large samples of data and of human critical thinking to find patterns in those data. Specifically, the method is used to evaluate the adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies, analyse how they are deployed worldwide, and investigate their sustainability outcomes. In terms of overall frequency, robots and cybersecurity are the most often reported technologies. Broken down by the firm's region, Asian firms have the highest rate of adoption, while African firms are lagging. Regarding the themes, Industry 4.0 is mainly adopted to improve production processes and customer experience. A small percentage of firms, particularly in Europe and North America, utilize Industry 4.0 to reduce the environmental footprint of their operations. Furthermore, results indicate that Industry 4.0 and sustainability are following two routes. Some firms have massively adopted Industry 4.0 to increase operational efficiency and reaped environmental gains as an indirect consequence of improved operations. Others have chosen to balance the adoption of technologies aimed to increase productivity with innovations whose explicit aim is the reduction of their operations' environmental footprint, such as additive manufacturing. Eastern firms tend to follow the first route while western firms the second. African and South American firms are still at a very early stage in their Industry 4.0 and sustainability journey. At the global level, Industry 4.0 is still far from being utilized as a catalyst to develop sustainability-driven business models. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"In this paper, we compare different methods to extract skill demand from the text of job descriptions. We propose the fraction of wage variation explained by the extracted skills as a novel performance metric for the comparison of methods. Using this, we compare the performance of the word-counting method with three different dictionaries and that of three unsupervised topic-modeling techniques, the LDA, the PLSA and the BERTopic. We apply these methods to a U.K. job board dataset of 1,158,926 job advertisements from 35 industries collected in 2018. We find that each of the dictionary-based methods explain about 20% of the wage variation across jobs. The topic modeling techniques perform better as the PLSA is able to explain 36.5% of the wage variation, while BERTopic 32.6%. The best performing method is the LDA with 48.3% of the wage variation explained. Its disadvantage, however, is in the difficulty of interpretation of the skills extracted. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Objective: The aim of the present study was to assess the current strategies of endovascular and laparoscopic extravascular stenting for symptomatic compression of the left renal vein (LRV), most frequently between the aorta and superior mesenteric artery (nutcracker syndrome [NCS]). Methods: We performed a systematic review of all studies of endovascular and laparoscopic extravascular LRV stenting for NCS using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane, Science Citation Index Expanded, Emerging Sources Citation Index, and Epistemonikos databases. Data were collected in accordance with the PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis) guidelines. The English, Spanish, and German language literature was searched from January 1, 1946 to February 9, 2022. The outcomes assessed included symptom resolution, hematuria resolution, and reintervention at follow-up. Results: The search yielded 3498 reports. After removing the duplicates and those without the full text available, 1724 studies were screened. Of these, 11 studies were included in the present review. Of the 11 studies, 7 were on endovascular stenting and 4 on laparoscopic extravascular stenting; all 11 studies were retrospective, single-center case series. Of the 233 patients, 170 (80 women) had undergone endovascular stenting and 63 (9 women) had undergone extravascular stenting. The follow-up period varied from 1 to 60 months after endovascular stenting and 3 to 55 months after extravascular stenting. The symptoms had resolved in 76% (range, 50%-100%) after endovascular stenting and 83% (range, 71%-100%) after extravascular stenting. Hematuria had resolved in 86% (range, 60%-100%) after endovascular stenting and 89% (range, 77%-100%) after extravascular stenting. Of 185 patients, 9 had required reintervention after endovascular stenting and none after extravascular stenting. Conclusions: Endovascular and laparoscopic extravascular stenting are less invasive and, thus, more attractive treatment options that have been more recently developed for the management of NCS. The results from the present study have shown that symptom and hematuria resolution must be provided before they can be considered preferred management options for patients affected by NCS. Given the limited number of patients involved, no definitive conclusion could be drawn regarding the superiority of one technique compared with the other. © 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery"
"Automatically assessing academic papers has enormous potential to reduce peer-review burden and individual bias. Existing studies strive for building sophisticated deep neural networks to identify academic value based on comprehensive data, e.g., academic graphs and full papers. However, these data are not always easy to access. And the content of the paper rather than other features outside the paper should matter in a fair assessment. Furthermore, while BERT models can maintain general semantics by pre-training on large-scale corpora, they tend to be over-smoothing due to stacked self-attention layers among unfiltered input tokens. Therefore, it is nontrivial to figure out distinguishable value of an academic paper from its limited content. In this study, we propose a novel deep neural network, namely Dual-view Graph Convolutions Enhanced BERT (DGC-BERT), for academic paper acceptance estimation. We combine the title and abstract of the paper as input. Then, a pre-trained BERT model is employed to extract the paper's general representations. Apart from hidden representations of the final layer, we highlight the first and last few layers as lexical and semantic views. In particular, we re-examine the dual-view filtered self-attention matrices via constructing two graphs, respectively. After that, two multi-hop Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are separately employed to capture pivotal and distant dependencies between the tokens. Moreover, the dual-view representations are facilitated by each other with biaffine attention modules. And a re-weighting gate is proposed to further streamline the dual-view representations with the help of the original BERT representation. Finally, whether the submitted paper could be acceptable is predicted based on the original language model features cooperated with the dual-view dependencies. Extensive data analyses and the full paper based MHCNN studies provide insights into the task and structural functions. Comparison experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed DGC-BERT significantly outperforms alternative approaches, especially the state-of-the-art models like MHCNN and BERT variants. Additional analyses reveal significance and explainability of the proposed modules in the DGC-BERT.

"Along with the proliferation of big data technology, organizations are involved in an overwhelming data ocean, the huge volume of data makes them at a loss in the face of frequent data breaches due to their failure of efficient data security management. Data classification has become a hot topic as a cornerstone of data protection especially in China in recent years, by categorizing information types and distinguishing protective measures at different classification levels. Both the text and tables of the promulgated data classification-related regulations (for simplicity, laws, regulations, policies, and standards are collectively referred to as “regulations”) contain a wealth of valuable information which can guide the work of data classification. To best assist data practitioners, in this paper, we automatically “grasp” expert experience on how to classify data from the analysis of such regulations. We design a framework, GENONTO, that automatically extracts data classification practices (DCPs), such as information types and their corresponding sensitive levels to construct an information type lexicon as well as to encode a generic ontology on top of 38 real-world regulations promulgated in China. GENONTO employs machine learning techniques and natural language processing (NLP) to parse unstructured text and tables. To our knowledge, GENONTO is the first work that explores critical information like the category and the sensitivity of information types from regulations, and organizes them in a structured form of ontology, characterizing the subsumptive relations between different information types. Our research helps provide a well-defined integrated view across regulations and bridges the gap between what experts say and how data practitioners do. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Small things loom large as a distinct category in social and cultural analysis. However, the social construction and effects of this idiom of scale commonly remain vague and underexplored. Bringing the literature on quantification in conversation with the literature on scale-making, this article offers a theoretically-informed analysis of how smallness consolidates as a publicly salient social attribute, and how it feeds collective narratives. The empirical focus is on American Jewry – an ethnoreligious minority group whose leaders and experts have invested in its quantification, including its representation as a small population. Drawing on a variety of texts and images, as well as on interviews and fieldwork, I show that American Jewish research bodies and public figures engage in a myriad of comparative arithmetic exercises and spectacles of scale to assert the smallness of the population. Deploying smallness as a generative narrative tool allows them to engage with the ambivalences implicated in the American-Jewish post-Holocaust, minority, and diasporic experience. In particular, exercises around notions of numerical negligibility, disproportional success, and numerical inferiority elicit protean narratives around endangerment, power, and a questioned diasporic future. The broader theoretical intervention of this article is to offer scalemaking as a valuable prism for understanding the narrative potency and poignancy of arithmetically-based constructs such as smallness. Instead of emphasizing the assumed epistemological strengths of numbers, this article considers the narrative work that statistics do when they lend themselves to multimodal scaling. It argues that through scaling, statistics are infused with perspective, relevance and meaning, descriptively and prescriptively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Purpose: To evaluate outcomes of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rupture in patients ≥40 years treated nonoperatively or with ACL reconstruction (ACLR). Methods: A review of MEDLINE, CINAHL, SportDiscus, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases from inception to June 1, 2021, was performed to identify randomized controlled trials, prospective or retrospective cohorts, case controls, or case series that met the following criteria: English-language studies reporting at least one subjective and/or objective outcome measure in ACL rupture patients ≥40 years treated nonoperatively or by ACLR. No limits were placed on graft type, time-to-surgery/follow-up, or concomitant procedures. Variability in patient-reported outcome scores, including subjective IKDC score, Lysholm score, Tegner activity score, and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, was assessed to evaluate the utility of applying previously established clinically meaningful thresholds to pooled outcome data. Results: 12,605 citations were identified using screening criteria. Sixty studies satisfied criteria following full-text review. As previous systematic reviews reported on earlier literature evaluating ACLR outcomes in patients ≥40 years, studies in this review were limited to include only those published in the last 10 years (40 studies). An additional 16 studies were excluded based on aims of the review not identified during initial screen. Although preoperative to postoperative population-based improvements in Lysholm score, Tegner score, and IKDC score surpassed minimal clinically important differences (MCID) in at least 50% of studies, the variability present in the pooled data may limit its application. No studies evaluated nonoperative outcomes. Conclusions: Evidence supports operative management in patients ≥40 years, as studies generally demonstrated preoperative to postoperative improvements in clinical outcomes based on population-level changes. However, application of patient-level clinically relevant thresholds to pooled outcome data should be undertaken with caution as reporting of population-based outcome scores may not accurately reflect changes in individual patients.

"An imbalance in the population gender ratio is a real-world problem that China faces. A related issue is how the ratio imbalance will affect FinTech innovation. Based on a theoretical analysis, this paper uses text mining and CRITIC methods to construct a provincial FinTech innovation index from 2008 to 2018 and studies the impact of the gender ratio on FinTech innovation. The results show that the gender imbalance can promote FinTech innovation by increasing the social risk-taking level. It is also found that an imbalanced gender ratio also increases FinTech risk exposure. This paper provides insights into the demographic reasons behind the rise and development of China's FinTech industry. © 2022"
"Sentiment analysis on views and opinions expressed in Indian regional languages has become the current focus of research. But, compared to a globally accepted language like English, research on sentiment analysis in Indian regional languages like Malayalam are very low. One of the major hindrances is the lack of publicly available Malayalam datasets. This work focuses on building a Malayalam dataset for facilitating sentiment analysis on Malayalam texts and studying the efficiency of a pre-trained deep learning model in analyzing the sentiments latent in Malayalam texts. In this work, a Malayalam dataset has been created by extracting 2,000 tweets from Twitter. The bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) is a pre-trained model that has been used for various natural language processing tasks. This work employs a transformer-based BERT model for Malayalam sentiment analysis. The efficacy of BERT in analyzing the sentiments latent in Malayalam texts has been studied by comparing the performance of BERT with various machine learning models as well as deep learning models. By analyzing the results, it is found that a substantial increase in accuracy of 5% for BERT when compared with that of Bi-GRU, which is the next best-performing model. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

"Background and purpose: Approximately 30% of epilepsy patients develop a drug-refractory epilepsy, that is, seizures cannot be controlled with antiepileptic drugs. Surgery has been evaluated as an effective but costly form of treatment. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesize the available evidence on the cost-effectiveness of surgical treatment compared to medical treatment for these patients. Method: A systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and the National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database until September 2022. Title, abstract and full-text screening were conducted by two researchers. Original studies published in English or German analyzing the cost-effectiveness of surgical compared to medical treatment were included. Study characteristics, effectiveness measures, costs and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were extracted. The quality of studies was assessed using the Drummond checklist. Results: Fourteen studies were included. Most studies evaluated surgery as cost-effective. The ICER per patient seizure free ranged from dominant to purchasing power parity US dollars (PPP-USD) 479,275. The ICER per 1% seizure reduction ranged from PPP-USD 227 to PPP-USD 342. The ICER per year without seizures was PPP-USD 4202 and the ICER per quality-adjusted life-year ranged from dominant to PPP-USD 90,874. The studies varied greatly in their methodology and time horizon. Conclusion: Surgical treatment is cost-effective compared to medical treatment, especially when a lifetime horizon is adopted. It is concluded that all disease-specific costs should be considered over a long period when assessing the cost-effectiveness of epilepsy treatment. From an economic perspective, efforts should be made to improve access to surgical treatment for patients with drug-refractory epilepsy. © 2022 European Academy of Neurology."
"This paper utilizes recent advances in automated text analysis to investigate whether and how the shifting inflation focus in the monetary policy strategy of the Federal Reserve (Fed) is reflected in the transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings over the course of the last quarter century. We ascertain that inflation references have surged in the FOMC's communication long before the implementation of the Fed's explicit inflation targeting framework in 2012. We go on to assess whether the FOMC's inflation communication had a direct impact on the monetary policy decisions of the Fed by estimating Taylor-type rules augmented by the FOMC's tone-measured inflation references. We find these to induce quantitatively small but positive effects on the policy rate and the inflation reaction coefficient. In this sense, the FOMC communication on inflation reflects the Fed's monetary policy stance quite closely. However, all these effects already occur prior to 2012, whereas the actual implementation of the inflation targeting framework itself elicits no further monetary tightening. Our evidence is in line with the FOMC's communication at the time framing the implementation of inflation targeting as a continuation of the pursuit of the price stability objective rather than as a genuine change in the Fed's monetary policy regime. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"This study examines the influence of digital finance on green growth using China's city-level data from 2008 to 2019. Web crawler technology and a super-efficiency SBM model are employed to measure inclusive digital finance and green growth. For mechanism analysis, it innovatively quantifies the enterprise digital transformation using Big Data text and factor analysis techniques from the unique perspective of disclosing textual information about “enterprise digital transformation”. The results exhibit that inclusive digital finance significantly promotes green growth, and these results are consistent using robust standard error estimation, bootstrap sampling, endogenous estimators, and alternative proxies. The regional samples demonstrate heterogeneous outcomes, suggesting that the influence of digital finance is more pronounced in eastern and central regions than in the western region. Moreover, the asymmetric effect of digital finance is documented through panel quantile regression. It displays that the influence of digital finance turns stronger from the 3rd to 7th quantile and decreases hereafter. Manifestly, the mechanism analysis discovers that digital finance encourages green growth by supporting the digital transformation of enterprises and addressing energy poverty. These findings offer valuable policy recommendations for legislators. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"The proposed hybrid fifth Generation-based approaches are employed to analyze and investigate the feedback of 37,855 patients from 65 hospitals worldwide and gathered through various online modes. The collected data was analyzed with various cloud-computing technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) based algorithms like natural language pre-processing (NLP), text mining (TM), and sentiment analysis (SA). This work discusses the new opportunities in the healthcare sector and the capabilities that 5G influences can bring to the healthcare industry. According to a recent investigation, the overall assessment ranking agrees with the personal view (sentiment) rating analysis for the title and full element of the web-based feedback obtained from the patients of different hospitals worldwide through an online survey. There are five main categories in the healthcare sector for which patients give priority and expect good services. They are treatment, physical facilities, dependability, timely committed service, and responsiveness. This research makes theoretical and practical contributions to the interdisciplinary areas comprising computer science, data management, and healthcare services by utilizing recent analytic techniques to attain optimized results. © 2022"
"Existing personality detection methods based on user-generated text have two major limitations. First, they rely too much on pre-trained language models to ignore the sentiment information in psycholinguistic features. Secondly, they have no consensus on the psycholinguistic feature selection, resulting in the insufficient analysis of sentiment information. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel personality detection method based on high-dimensional psycholinguistic features and improved distributed Gray Wolf Optimizer (GWO) for feature selection (IDGWOFS). Specifically, we introduced the Gaussian Chaos Map-based initialization and neighbor search strategy into the original GWO to improve the performance of feature selection. To eliminate the bias generated when using mutual information to select features, we adopt symmetric uncertainty (SU) instead of mutual information as the evaluation for correlation and redundancy to construct the fitness function, which can balance the correlation between features–labels and the redundancy between features–features. Finally, we improve the common Spark-based parallelization design of GWO by parallelizing only the fitness computation steps to improve the efficiency of IDGWOFS. The experiments indicate that our proposed method obtains average accuracy improvements of 3.81% and 2.19%, and average F1 improvements of 5.17% and 5.8% on Essays and Kaggle MBTI dataset, respectively. Furthermore, IDGWOFS has good convergence and scalability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Studies investigating L2 English receptive and productive vocabulary knowledge in young learners have shown that English can be picked up through exposure outside the classroom. In this study I looked into lexical characteristics of young learners’ writing at the start of formal English lessons in the first year of secondary school (n = 3168). The texts were given a holistic score and several lexical measures were calculated. The results showed large individual differences between learners’ writing. Regression analysis was used to investigate which lexical characteristics predicted proficiency scores. The final model explained 50% of the variance. Similar to what was found in previous research investigating young L2 English learners’ writing I found that a number of broad predictors impacted the proficiency score. These were lexical diversity, word count, total number of spelling errors and percentage of English words used. Additionally, four fine-grained variables predicted the proficiency score: word frequency, trigram frequency, age of acquisition and imageability. The results show the added value of investigating a wide range of variables to shed light on the lexical factors that might impact writing scores, even in beginner and pre-intermediate level L2 writing. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Several research studies have been conducted on multi-label classification algorithms for text and images, but few have been conducted on multi-label classification for users. Moreover, the existing multi-label user classification algorithm does not provide an effective representation of users, and it is difficult to use directly in social media scenarios. By analyzing complex social networks, this paper aims to achieve multi-label classification of users based on research in single-label classification. Considering the limitations of existing research, this paper proposes a user topic classification method based on heterogeneous networks as well as a user multi-label classification method based on community detection. The model is trained using the ML-KNN multi-label classification algorithm. In actual scenarios, the algorithm is more effective than existing multi-label classification methods when applied to multi-label classification tasks for social media users. According to the results of the analysis, the algorithm has a high level of accuracy in classifying different theme users into a variety of different scenarios using different theme users. Furthermore, this study contributes to the advancement of classification research by expanding its perspective. © 2022"
"This article explores the elaboration and application of the Old Testament idea of ‘covenant’ among Zambian church leaders who are Christian nationalist activists. In this framework, Zambia serves as an analogue of biblical Israel, while contemporary government and church leaders are the analogues of Old Testament kings, priests, and prophets. This covenantal approach presents challenges. On the one hand, government support for Christian nationalism encourages the compliance of church leaders with state-led religious projects; on the other hand, however, the analogical reading of the biblical text on which this support depends casts the church in a prophetic role, which in turn opens the door for criticism of the government. Christian nationalist activists in Zambia therefore find themselves caught in a double-bind that simultaneously encourages submission and critique. An analysis of this process contributes an important non-Western perspective to contemporary discussions of Christian nationalism. It also complicates easy interpretations of Christian nationalism as abetting state power by demonstrating its critical possibilities. © 2022 The Authors.

"The aim of the present study was to examine barriers to reporting sexual offenses as reflected in texts by victims who participated in the #WhyIDidntReport protest that revolved around the reasons for not reporting sexual offenses. Content analysis was used to analyze 95 public posts of Israeli victims published on social media. The findings revealed two main barrier dimensions—personal and social—each comprising several main themes. The most common barrier in the personal dimension was difficulty naming or labeling the experience as a sexual offense to begin with. The most prominent barriers in the social dimension were the power gap between offender and victim, and concern with others' reactions. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our findings from the perspectives of alternative dispute resolution, with focus on restorative justice as an optional platform for victims. © 2022 The Authors.

"Background: This conceptual paper is an invitation to reflection and action, and is especially targeted to social marketing researchers and professionals to sensitize and engage in recent efforts to break with the limited and low coverage of investigations and interventions in the field on the topics of racism and anti-racism. Filling this gap is a challenge to be faced by academics and social marketers so that the area can properly connect, understand and contribute to contemporary movements that are challenging society for change. Focus of the Article: This study aims to explicate and delineate conceptual approximations between the thinking and practices of social marketing and anti-racism to explore the observation of points of dialogue and potential, while the articulation of these approaches can accelerate and strengthen positive social changes. Research Questions: What is anti-racism? What aspects and actions circumscribe and contribute to integrating anti-racism and social marketing knowledge? How can this articulation support the analysis and development of anti-racist social marketing strategies and interventions? Importance to the Social Marketing Field: This paper contributes to encourage an expansion of mentality, knowledge and behavior related to racial issues and social marketing, and to stimulate ideas that, supported by anti-racism studies and interventions, provide paths that can be continuously adopted in the research, design and implementation of social marketing initiatives. Methods: This conceptual article is organized by a literature survey, from sources such as recent meta-analyses, reviews and experimental studies from marketing, communication, education, and social and cognitive psychology, in order to understand the conceptual aspects of racism and anti-racism and their expressions in the contemporary world. Also, there are some case and practice suggestions on how anti-racism and social marketing can be aligned to address racism. The literature explored in this article is published in English and Portuguese. Results: The anti-racism aspects presented in this text cover and provide paths that can be useful and explored in different directions in social marketing research and practice. From this perspective, the shared conceptual organization can also support academics and professionals in the area, unfamiliar with studies on racism and anti-racism expressions, to integrate these concepts in their research, plans and programs of intervention or review in these activities. Recommendations for Research or Practice: The reported case and practice suggestions are not analyzed in depth. However, this is a task that should be developed critically and with more attention in future works, considering the developments, metrics, sustainability, backlash effects, and effectiveness or not of recent initiatives. More broadly, it is also pointed out that anti-racist commitments and initiatives of companies’ diversity and inclusion programs, such as those reviewed in the text, should be considered as relevant sources of analysis for social marketing studies. © The Author(s) 2022."
"This partially longitudinal study focussed on the ability of pupils to write descriptive texts in English and French as foreign languages and German as language of schooling. The teaching of two foreign languages from primary school onwards is compulsory in Switzerland, where this study is situated. The study responds to the urgent need for empirical research on cross-linguistic and cross-level development as a foundation for the improvement of language teaching. Current curricula do provide for the coherent fostering of the plurilingual repertoires of learners, across languages and school levels. But this still stands in sharp contrast to the multiple compartmentalisations and discontinuities induced by the educational system. Letters with spatial descriptions were collected in a quasi-experimental design in the canton of St. Gallen at the end of primary school (Year 6, N=185) and in the first year of secondary school (Year 7, N=218). The texts were analysed in terms of spatial organisation and text length. Moderate but statistically significant correlations between languages were found for both variables. The analysis revealed continuity of the development in the foreign languages, but stagnation in the language of schooling. The benefits of fostering transversally accessible textual patterns through a genre-based approach, in particular for the second foreign language (L3), are discussed.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"Objectives: Real-world evidence (RWE) studies are increasingly being used to support healthcare decisions. Various frameworks, tools, and checklists exist for ensuring quality of real-world data, designing robust studies, and assessing potential for bias. In January 2021, Structured Template and Reporting Tool for RWE (STaRT-RWE) was released to further reduce ambiguity, assumptions, and misinterpretation while planning, implementing, and reporting RWE studies of the safety and effectiveness of treatments. The objective of this study was to identify gaps in the reporting quality of published RWE studies by using this template for critical appraisal. Methods: Two reviewers conducted a keyword search on PubMed for free-full-text research articles using real-world data, RWE design, and safety with or without effectiveness outcomes of a medicinal product or intervention in humans of any age or gender, published in English between January 13, 2021, and January 13, 2022. Assessment of risk of bias was done using Assessment of Real-World Observational Studies critical appraisal tool. Deficiencies in methods and findings as per STaRT-RWE template were reported as frequencies. Results: A total of 54 of 2374 retrieved studies were included in the review. Based on the STaRT-RWE template, the studies inadequately reported empirically defined covariates, power and sample size calculation, attrition, sensitivity analyses, index date (day 0) defining criterion, predefined covariates, outcome, metadata about data source and software, objective, inclusion and exclusion criteria, analysis specifications, and follow-up. Conclusions: The use of STaRT-RWE template along with its tables, design diagram, and library of published studies has a potential of improving robustness of RWE studies. © 2022"
"Sentiment analysis has become one of the most active research areas in natural language processing, and the Arabic language retains its importance in this field. It is so because of the increased use of Arabic on the internet that pushes many users to share their views or thoughts about certain products and services. Despite its crucial importance, most of the existing Arabic sentiment analysis studies have been performed on document or sentence levels with little attention to the aspect level. However, the aspect level’s main objective, also known as aspect-based sentiment analysis, is to extract the discussed aspects and identify their related sentiment polarities from a given review or text. The result is to provide more detailed information than general sentiment analysis. Therefore, this paper seeks to provide a comprehensive review of the Arabic aspect-based sentiment analysis studies and highlights the main challenges that face the different proposed approaches. The relevant gaps in the current literature and the future research directions in this area are also discussed. This survey can guide future researchers who want to contribute to the improvement of this domain. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"This study investigated the preparedness and experience of students for the fast-paced convergence of ICT and higher education. Overall, 366 distance students with a history of self-directed learning through correspondence courses were profiled using structured text-based online interviews. Twelve students’ attributes on ICT material possession and competencies and experience of Open Distance and Open Learning (ODeL) were collected and analysed. The findings show that the majority of students (72%) who had prior knowledge about the basic concepts of ODeL modalities indicated satisfaction with the e-learning environment while the learning mode is challenging for traditional students (28%). Statistically significant positive correlations (ρ = 0.00) were observed between ICT competencies or preparedness: the level of prior academic qualifications (HAQ: r2 = 0.35); key challenge faced (KC: r2 = 0.26); and the convenience of ODeL (C.ODeL: r2 = 0.18). To ensure that students are not left behind with the proliferation of ICT in distance education, principal component analysis revealed that having prior knowledge about the ODeL modalities is an important attribute that contributes to students’ preparedness for the e-learning environment, thus bridging the variance between the expected expectations and the actual expectations. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"The Brazilian Supreme Court receives tens of thousands of cases each semester. Court employees spend thousands of hours to execute the initial analysis and classification of those cases—which takes effort away from posterior, more complex stages of the case management workflow. In this paper, we explore multimodal classification of documents from Brazil’s Supreme Court. We train and evaluate our methods on a novel multimodal dataset of 6510 lawsuits (339,478 pages) with manual annotation assigning each page to one of six classes. Each lawsuit is an ordered sequence of pages, which are stored both as an image and as a corresponding text extracted through optical character recognition. We first train two unimodal classifiers: A ResNet pre-trained on ImageNet is fine-tuned on the images, and a convolutional network with filters of multiple kernel sizes is trained from scratch on document texts. We use them as extractors of visual and textual features, which are then combined through our proposed fusion module. Our fusion module can handle missing textual or visual input by using learned embeddings for missing data. Moreover, we experiment with bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) networks and linear-chain conditional random fields to model the sequential nature of the pages. The multimodal approaches outperform both textual and visual classifiers, especially when leveraging the sequential nature of the pages. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Proper attention to the theme of corporeality is crucial for understanding Derrida’s analysis of Hegel in “The Pit and the Pyramid.” This article argues that Derrida’s essay compels us to face the impossibility of giving a wholly coherent account of embodiment. The Aufhebung supposedly unites the exteriority of the corporeal with interiority in a higher unity that cancels and preserves them both; Hegel’s own text reveals, however, that meaning is primordially absent from the body that was thought to incarnate it. And it is this absence of ideal meaning that is originary: Differance conditions the body as it conditions speech, rendering the body other than itself such that it is not categorizable as flesh that is the self or as an object that is not the self. I am and am not my body because the dichotomy between interiority and exteriority breaks down even at the level of the body. Indeed, I am and am not my self; the embodied self is disrupted from the start, never self-contained. Thus embodiment always already testifies to the other. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Background: Low back pain is a musculoskeletal disorder (MSD), and Kegel exercise is considered as one of the non-surgical management methods. Therefore, the present systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the results of randomized clinical trials (RCT) about the effect of pelvic floor muscle-strengthening exercises on reducing low back pain‏.‏ Methods: The present study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guideline (2020) to January 2022. The relevant studies were searched in the MagIran, SID, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science (WoS), Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov databases and Google Scholar motor engine using related MeSH/Emtree terms, which were combined with free text word. The heterogeneity of the studies was checked using I2 statistic. Results: Finally, 19 RCTs with a sample size of 456 subjects in the intervention group and 470 in the control group were included in the meta-analysis. The low back pain intensity in the intervention group decreased up to 1.261 ± 0.213 (SMD ± 95% CI) with I2 = 87.60 more than that in the control group (P <0.001). The low back pain intensity in postpartum women decreased up to 1.614 ± 0.312 (95% CI) followed by pregnant women as 1.282 ± 0.479 (SMD ± 95% CI) more than that in other populations. But due to high the heterogeneity in all sub-groups (I2 > 80%) this result should be considered with caution. Meta-regression analysis showed the effect of pelvic floor muscle-strengthening exercises increased by increasing the year of publication, quality assessment score of the article, and the number of weeks of intervention (P<0.05). Conclusion: Based on the results of the present meta-analysis, pelvic floor muscle-strengthening exercises significantly reduce the low back pain intensity. Therefore, these exercises can be regarded as a part of a low back pain management plan. © 2022, Fondazione Società Italiana di Neurologia."
"Social media is more and more dominant in everyday life for people around the world. YouTube content is a resource that may be useful, in social computational science, for understanding key questions about society. Using this resource, we performed web scraping to create a dataset of 644,575 video transcriptions concerning net activism and whistleblowing. We automatically performed linguistic feature extraction to capture a representation of each video using its title, description and transcription (downloaded metadata). The next step was to clean the dataset using automatic clustering with linguistic representation to identify unmatched videos and noisy keywords. Using these keywords to exclude videos, we finally obtained a dataset that was reduced by 95%, i.e., it contained 35,730 video transcriptions. Then, we again automatically clustered the videos using a lexical representation and split the dataset into subsets, leading to hundreds of clusters that we interpreted manually to identify a hierarchy of topics of interest concerning whistleblowing. We used the dataset to learn a lexical representation for a specific topic and to detect unknown whistleblowing videos for this topic; the accuracy of this detection is 57.4%. We also used the dataset to identify interesting context linguistic markers around the names of whistleblowers. From a given list of names, we automatically extracted all 5-g word sequences from the dataset and identified interesting markers in the left and right contexts for each name by manual interpretation. The results of our study are the following: a dataset (raw and cleaned collections) concerning whistleblowing, a hierarchy of topics about whistleblowing, the automatic prediction of whistleblowing and the semi-automatic semantic analysis of markers around whistleblower names. This text mining analysis can be exploited for digital sociology and e-democracy studies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"This brief describes a Ku-band passive time-varying phase shifter (TVPS). The time variable is introduced into the conventional vector-sum phase shifter (VSPS) architecture, and the time-varying vector-sum method is proposed for the first time to realize continuous phase shifting. The proof-of-concept passive TVPS consisting of a quadrature coupler, two 0/180° bi-phase modulators and an output combiner is implemented in 0.13- $\mathbf {\mathrm {\mu }}\text{m}$ CMOS technology with a core area of 2.2 $\mathbf {\times }$ 0.8 mm2, and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is used to provide gain-control timing sequences with the modulation frequency of 100 kHz for its four control bits. The timing sequences are optimized to eliminate unwanted sidebands, and the measured sideband suppression ratio (SSR) is -17.2 dBc. For both forward and backward phase shifting modes, measured results show that the proposed TVPS can achieve the phase resolution of 10-bits, RMS phase error of 0.20.5°, RMS gain error of less than 0.2 dB over the 1218 GHz frequency band.  © 2004-2012 IEEE."
"With more than one billion active users, Instagram is one of the most widely utilized social media platforms. Although recent research has begun to analyze brand-related images, Instagram remains largely neglected within halal food research. In this study, we aim to fill this research gap by collecting, labeling, aggregating, clustering, analyzing, and mapping halal food images, text, and social tagging on Instagram. In total, approximately 95,000 photos related to #halalfood tag were extracted from Instagram along with data related to photo captions, social tags, and comments on the posted photos. Google’s Cloud Vision Application Programming Interface (API) was employed for image labeling to represent context of the photos. The photos were categorized, based on their label, into food, place, advertisement, event, and unhealthy food. The captions and comments in each category were analyzed using the associate network and sentiment analysis approaches. The study found the most frequent tags in Instagram posts, besides the obvious halal food related tags, were #halalfoodexpo, #halalfoodkorea, #halalfoodfestival, and #burger. Furthermore, the most influential tags, besides the halal food related tags, were #halalfoodexpo, #chicken, #halalfoodkorea, #halaltourism, and #repost. In addition, it was found that most of the Instagram data contain positive sentiments towards halal food. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Microplastics are considered the major pollutant of the Anthropocene. This study presents a retrospective examination of the literature to characterize microplastic research in marine and freshwater habitats and to explore the interconnections among the topics uncovered. After automated text mining, topic modeling was carried out to track the evolution of research topics in peer-reviewed articles on microplastics published from January 2010 to May 2021. The literature analysis suggested a total of 15 topics. The most representative terms in topics related exclusively to marine habitats were similar and differed from those in the topics related to both marine and freshwater habitats. The observed patterns in the popularity of the topics uncovered suggest that several topics have tended to increase in prevalence over time. However, no topic had high popularity, and only two topics were considered “cold,” i.e., there was a drop in prevalence over time. The topics that had the largest research gaps on average across all topics were also among the most specific, those describing the key themes of certain manuscripts. This type of literature analysis is increasingly necessary so that the scientific knowledge available can be useful in the search for solutions to the environmental problems of today’s society. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Objective: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral entrapment mononeuropathy. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the reported clinical effectiveness and safety of ultrasound-guided percutaneous carpal tunnel release (USCTR) for the treatment of CTS. Literature Survey: PubMed, EMBASE, and ScienceDirect databases were queried from database inception to February 20, 2021, to identify clinical studies on USCTR. Methodology: Two reviewers independently completed title, abstract, and full-text screening, and they extracted data in duplicate for analysis. Procedure techniques, outcome measures, and complications were descriptively analyzed. Synthesis: Eighty-seven studies were eligible for screening. Twenty studies (three randomized controlled trials, three prospective cohort studies, and 14 case series) met inclusion criteria, with a total of 1772 USCTR cases. The overall level of evidence was very low, with seven studies with at least moderate risk of bias. Thirteen studies exceeded the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire Symptom Severity Scale (BCTQ-SS) and Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire Functional Status Scale (BCTQ-FS), and six studies exceeded the MCID for the Quick Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder & Hand (QDASH). Five studies reported statistically significant improvement in these functional outcome measures as early as the first week post-procedure. A major complication occurred in one patient who developed suspected compartment syndrome, and minor complications were reported in 24 patients. Conclusions: Based on very low level of evidence, early studies suggest that USCTR may be an effective treatment for CTS, with potential for short post-procedure recovery times. © 2022 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation."
"Open-world classification requires a classifier not only to classify samples of the observed classes but also to detect samples which are not suitable to be classified as the known classes. State-of-the-art methods train a feature extractor to extract features for separating known classes with limited training data. Then some strategies, such as outlier detector, are used to reject samples from unknown classes based on the feature space. However, they are prone to extract the discriminative features among known classes and cannot model comprehensive features of known classes, which causes the classification errors when detecting the samples from the unknown classes in an open world scenario. Motivated by the theory of psychology and cognitive science, we utilize both class descriptions and commonsense knowledge summarized by human to refine the discriminant features and propose a regularization strategy. The regularization is incorporated into the feature extractor, which is enabled to further improve the performance of our model in an open-world environment. Extensive experiments and visualization analysis are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed model. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Basic emotion classification is one of the main tasks of Sentiment Analysis usually performed by using several machine learning techniques. One of the main issues in Sentiment Analysis is the availability of tagged resources to properly train supervised classification algorithms. This is of particular concern in languages other than English, such as Spanish, where scarcity of these resources is the norm. In addition, most basic emotion datasets available in Spanish are rather small, containing a few hundred (or thousand) samples. Usually, the samples only contain a short text (frequently a comment) and a tag (the basic emotion), omitting crucial contextual information that may help to improve the classification task results. In this paper, the impact of using contextual information is measured on a recently published Spanish basic emotion dataset and the baseline architecture proposed in the Semantic Evaluation 2019 competition. This particular dataset has two main advantages for this paper. First, it was compiled using Distant Supervision and as a result it contains several hundred thousand samples. Secondly, the authors included valuable contextual information for each comment. The results show that contextual information, such as news headlines or summaries, helps improve the classification accuracy over a dataset of distantly supervised basic emotion labelled comments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Objective: The diagnostic accuracy of cell-free fetal DNA in screening for rare autosomal trisomies is uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis aiming to determine the predictive value of cell-free DNA in screening for rare autosomal trisomies. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched from inception to January 2022. Study Eligibility Criteria: All studies that reported on the diagnostic accuracy of cell-free DNA in the detection of rare autosomal trisomies were included. Case series were included if they contained at least 10 cases with diagnostic test results or postnatal genetic testing. Methods: Study appraisal was completed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Statistical analysis was performed using random-effects meta-analysis of double-arcsine transformed proportions of confirmed results in the fetus out of the positive tests to obtain a pooled estimate of the positive predictive value. Results: The search identified 7553 studies, of which 1852 were duplicates. After screening 5701 titles and abstracts, 380 studies proceeded to the full-text screen; 206 articles were retrieved for data extraction, of which another 175 articles were excluded. A total of 31 studies, with a total of 1703 women were included for analysis. The pooled positive predictive value of cell-free DNA for the diagnosis of rare autosomal trisomies was 11.46% (95% confidence interval, 7.80–15.65). Statistical heterogeneity was high (I2=82%). Sensitivity analysis restricted to 5 studies at low risk of bias demonstrated a pooled positive predictive value of 9.13% (95% confidence interval, 2.49–18.76). There were insufficient data to provide accurate ascertainment of sensitivity and specificity because most studies only offered confirmatory tests to women with high-risk results. Conclusion: The positive predictive value of cell-free DNA in diagnosing rare autosomal trisomies is approximately 11%. Clinicians should provide this information when offering cell-free DNA for screening of conditions outside of common autosomal trisomies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"This paper investigates the soybean futures price prediction problem from a new perspective and proposes an effective prediction model named Two-Stage Hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (TSH-LSTM) by using text data from social media. First, the unstructured text is transformed into structured data by sentiment analysis and text classification methods. The improved sentiment score is computed by combining the degree centrality of sentiment words based on the sentiment dictionary method, and the characteristics of price fluctuations in texts are learned through the text Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks. Second, the significant relationship between social media features and soybean futures price is assessed through stepwise regression, and the results of such an assessment are used as a basis for the identification of significant factors as input variables of the prediction model. Finally, the TSH-LSTM prediction model is designed, and the final prediction result is acquired through the combination of prediction results of each stage using the error reciprocal method. The empirical results indicate that the incorporation of the social media text feature helps improve forecasting performances. Specifically, the proposed TSH-LSTM is more accurate than univariate LSTM, multivariate LSTM, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Clustering of multivariate count data has widespread applications in areas such as text analysis and microbiome studies. The need to account for overdispersion generally results in a nonconvex loss function, which does not fit into the existing convex clustering framework. Moreover, prior knowledge of a network over the samples, often available from citation or similarity relationships, is not taken into account. We introduce Dirichlet-multinomial network fusion (DMNet) for clustering multivariate count data, which models the samples via Dirichlet-multinomial distributions with individual parameters and employs a weighted group L1 fusion penalty to pursue homogeneity over a prespecified network. To circumvent the nonconvexity issue, we present two exponential family approximations to the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution, which are amenable to efficient optimization and theoretical analysis. We derive an ADMM algorithm and establish nonasymptotic error bounds for the proposed methods. Our bounds involve a trade-off between the connectivity of the network and its fidelity to the true parameter. The usefulness of our methods is illustrated through simulation studies and two text clustering applications. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Sustainability is a major issue in the automotive sector and players are at different points in their transition. Adopting a multi-method approach, we identify the positioning of automotive manufacturers in relation to sustainability, highlighting the main foci of their sustainability strategies. This is achieved using a topic model based on automated language processing. Subsequently, we use a Seemingly Unrelated Regression model, applied to manufacturers' operational data, to establish the degree of alignment between sustainability strategies and operations. Results show that sustainability in the automotive sector is highly differentiated and manufacturers emphasize diverging topics in their communication strategy and have different production practices. In relation to sustainability reporting, we identify certain operational variables, which are significantly related with certain dominant sustainability narratives. © 2022 The Authors.

"Objective: The most commonly employed diagnostic criteria for identifying thyroid nodules include Thyroid Imaging and Reporting Data System (TI-RADS) and American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to determine the inter-rater reliability of thyroid ultrasound criteria. Methods: We performed a library search of MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), and Web of Science for full-text articles published from January 2005 to June 2022. We included full-text primary research articles that used TI-RADS and/or ATA guidelines to evaluate thyroid nodules in adults. These included studies must have calculated inter-rater reliability using any validated metric. The Quality Appraisal for Reliability Studies (QAREL) was used to assess study quality. We planned for a random-effects meta-analysis, in addition to covariate and publication bias analyses. This study was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis guidelines and registered prior to conduction (International prospective register of systematic reviews—PROSPERO: CRD42021275072). Results: Of the 951 articles identified via the database search, 35 met eligibility criteria. All studies were observational. The most commonly utilized criteria were ACR Thyroid Imaging and Reporting Data System (TI-RADS) and/or ATA criteria, while the majority of studies employed Κ statistics. For ACR TI-RADS, the pooled Κ was 0.51 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42, 0.57; n = 7) while for ATA, the pooled Κ was 0.52 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.67; n = 3). Due to the small number of studies, covariate or publication bias analyses were not performed. Conclusion: Ultrasound criteria demonstrate moderate inter-rater reliability, but these findings are impacted by poor study quality and a lack of standardization.

"This paper introduces the concept of deceptive (de)humanization, the internal belief that an outgroup is less-than-human while dishonestly acknowledging aspects of their humanity for impression management purposes. In a large online experiment (N = 1,169), participants wrote about their false or truthful opinions on an outgroup they perceived as more evolved or less evolved. Following several automated text analyses, the data indicated psychological differences in attention through word patterns. Consistent with prior work, deceptive texts contained fewer self-references and more negative emotion terms than truthful texts, and dehumanizers used more negative emotions than humanizers. New evidence suggests those who wrote deceptively about evolved groups focused the most on negative emotions compared to other participants. This work extends deception and dehumanization theory by investigating how such psychological constructs interact, and how they are reflected linguistically as communicators attempt to manage impressions and maintain a positive self-image. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Background: The expressiveness during reading is essential for a fluent reading. Reading prosody has been scarcely studied in an experimental manner, owing to the difficulties in taking objective and direct measures of this reading skill. However, new technologies development has made it possible to analyse reading prosody in an experimental way. Prosodic patterns may vary, not being the same at the beginning of the reading learning process as in adulthood. They may also be altered in disorders such as dyslexia, but little is known about the prosodic characteristics and reading fluency of people with neurodegenerative diseases that cause language impairment, such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Aims: The aim of this work was to study reading fluency in PD considering the prosodic characteristics of its reading. Methods & Procedures: The participants were 31 Spanish adults with PD and 31 healthy controls, aged 59–88 years. Two experimental texts were designed that included declarative, interrogative, and exclamatory sentences and experimental verbs and nouns. The manipulability level of the nouns and the motor content of the verbs were considered. The reading of the participants was recorded and analysed with Praat software. Outcomes & Results: A longer reading duration and a greater number of pauses, especially in verbs, were found in the PD group, which also showed less pitch variation than the control group in the experimental sentences. The control group showed a big initial rise in declarative and interrogative sentences, as well as a stronger final declination in declarative and exclamatory ones, when compared to the PD group. Conclusions & Implications: The use of experimental methodologies for the analysis of reading fluency allows learning more about the prosodic characteristics of people with different pathologies, such as PD. Scarce pitch variability found in the analysis, together with the great number of pauses and the longer reading duration, leads to poorly expressive reading, which compromises fluency in PD. The exhaustive evaluation of the reading fluency of PD patients will make it possible to design more complete assessment methods that will favour the diagnosis and early detection of this pathology. What this study adds: What is already known on this subject • The speech of people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is often impaired by the appearance of hypokinetic dysarthria. The language of people with PD is usually affected with the progression of the disease, with lexico-semantic impairment which mainly affects verbs. Previous literature on reading fluency in PD usually considers reading speed and accuracy, neglecting prosody. Other neurodegenerative diseases with language impairment, such as Alzheimer's disease, commonly cause reading fluency problems. What this paper adds to existing knowledge • This study provides direct and objective measures of the reading fluency (speed, accuracy and prosody) in patients with PD, by the design of experimental texts. Reading fluency characteristics were found to be altered in these patients, especially in pitch variations and reading duration. The reading of Parkinson's patients showed a more flattened pitch. In addition, a greater number of pauses and longer reading durations were also found in the reading of verbs compared to the control group. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? • The use of experimentally created texts makes it possible to analyse the influence of different psycholinguistic variables (frequency, length, motor content, manipulability) on reading fluency, and how the processing of these stimuli could be affected in PD. The objective analysis of the reading fluency characteristics in PD allows the design of more specific evaluation and diagnostic tasks. More complete assessment methods may allow the early detection of the disease. In the same way, it may favour a differential diagnosis with other neurodegenerative diseases. © 2022 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists."
"Computational methods, in particular text-as-data or Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches, have become popular to study climate change communication as a global and large-scale phenomenon. Scholars have discussed opportunities and challenges of these methods for climate change communication, with some proponents and critics taking strong positions, either embracing the potential of computational methods or critically questioning their value. Mirroring developments in the broader social scientific debate, we aim to bring both sides together by proposing a reflexive, integrative approach for computational research on climate change communication: We reflect on strengths (e.g., making data big and small, nowcasting observations) and weaknesses (e.g., introducing empiricist epistemologies, ignoring biases) of computational approaches. Moreover, we also provide concrete and constructive guidance on when and how to integrate (or not integrate) these methods based on theoretical considerations. We thereby understand computational methods as part of an ever-increasing, diverse toolbox for analyzing climate change communication.

"Background aims: Evidence regarding the extent that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) may improve clinical outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been limited by marked inter-study heterogeneity, inconsistent product characterization and appreciable risk of bias (RoB). Given the evolution of treatment options and trajectory of the pandemic, an updated analysis of high-quality evidence from randomized controlled trials is needed for a timely and conclusive understanding of the effectiveness of MSCs. Methods: A systematic literature search through March 30, 2022, identified all English language, full-text randomized controlled trials examining the use of MSCs in the treatment of COVID-19. Results: Eight studies were identified (316 patients, 165 administered MSCs and 151 controls). Controls evolved significantly over time with a broad range of comparison treatments. All studies reported mortality at study endpoint. Random effects meta-analysis revealed that MSCs decreased relative risk of death (risk ratio, 0.63, 95% confidence interval, 0.42–0.94, P = 0.02, I2 = 14%) with no significant difference in absolute risk of death. MSCs decreased length of hospital stay and C-reactive protein levels and increased odds of clinical improvement at study endpoint compared with controls. Rates of adverse events and severe adverse events were similar between MSC and control groups. Only two (25%) studies reported all four International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy criteria for MSC characterization. Included studies had low (n = 7) or some (n = 1) concerns regarding RoB. Conclusions: MSCs may reduce risk of death in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 and improve secondary clinical outcomes. Variable outcome reporting, inconsistent product characterization and variable control group treatments remain barriers to higher-quality evidence and may constrain clinical usage. A master protocol is proposed and appears necessary for accelerated translation of higher-quality evidence for future applications of MSC therapy. © 2022 International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy"
"Zero-shot Learning (ZSL) aims to recognize novel classes through seen knowledge. The canonical approach to ZSL leverages a visual-to-semantic embedding to map the global features of an image sample to its semantic representation. These global features usually overlook the fine-grained information which is vital for knowledge transfer between seen and unseen classes, rendering these features sub-optimal for ZSL task, especially the more realistic Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL) task where global features of similar classes could hardly be separated. To provide a remedy to this problem, we propose Language-Augmented Pixel Embedding (LAPE) that directly bridges the visual and semantic spaces in a pixel-based manner. To this end, we map the local features of each pixel to different attributes and then extract each semantic attribute from the corresponding pixel. However, the lack of pixel-level annotation conduces to an inefficient pixel-based knowledge transfer. To mitigate this dilemma, we adopt the text information of each attribute to augment the local features of image pixels which are related to the semantic attributes. Experiments on four ZSL benchmarks demonstrate that LAPE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses are provided to dissect what factors lead to this success.  © 1991-2012 IEEE."
"The assignment of codes to free-text clinical narratives have long been recognised to be beneficial for secondary uses such as funding, insurance claim processing and research. The current scenario of assigning clinical codes is a manual process which is very expensive, time-consuming and error prone. In recent years, many researchers have studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), related machine learning and deep learning methods and techniques to resolve the problem of manual coding of clinical narratives and to assist human coders to assign clinical codes more accurately and efficiently. The main objective of this systematic literature review is to provide a comprehensive overview of automated clinical coding systems that utilise appropriate NLP, machine learning and deep learning methods and techniques to assign the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes to discharge summaries. We have followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and conducted a comprehensive search of publications from January, 2010 to December 2021 in four high quality academic databases: PubMed, ScienceDirect, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) Anthology. We reviewed 6128 publications; 42 met the inclusion criteria. This review identified: 6 datasets having discharge summaries (2 publicly available, 4 acquired from hospitals); 14 NLP techniques along with some other data extraction processes, different feature extraction and embedding techniques. The review also shows that there is a significant increase in the use of deep learning models compared to machine learning. To measure the performance of classification methods, different evaluation metrics are used. Efforts are still required to improve ICD code prediction accuracy, availability of large-scale de-identified clinical corpora with the latest version of the classification system. This can be a platform to guide and share knowledge with the less experienced coders and researchers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Sentiment is fundamental to human communication. Countless marketing applications mine opinions from social media communication, news articles, customer feedback, or corporate communication. Various sentiment analysis methods are available and new ones have recently been proposed. Lexicons can relate individual words and expressions to sentiment scores. In contrast, machine learning methods are more complex to interpret, but promise higher accuracy, i.e., fewer false classifications. We propose an empirical framework and quantify these trade-offs for different types of research questions, data characteristics, and analytical resources to enable informed method decisions contingent on the application context. Based on a meta-analysis of 272 datasets and 12 million sentiment-labeled text documents, we find that the recently proposed transfer learning models indeed perform best, but can perform worse than popular leaderboard benchmarks suggest. We quantify the accuracy-interpretability trade-off, showing that, compared to widely established lexicons, transfer learning models on average classify more than 20 percentage points more documents correctly. To form realistic performance expectations, additional context variables, most importantly the desired number of sentiment classes and the text length, should be taken into account. We provide a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (called SiEBERT) with open-source scripts that can be applied as easily as an off-the-shelf lexicon. © 2022 The Authors"
"Purpose: To evaluate if nudges delivered by text message prior to an upcoming primary care visit can increase influenza vaccination rates. Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Two health systems in the Northeastern US between September 2020 and March 2021. Subjects: 74,811 adults. Interventions: Patients in the 19 intervention arms received 1-2 text messages in the 3 days preceding their appointment that varied in their format, interactivity, and content. Measures: Influenza vaccination. Analysis: Intention-to-treat. Results: Participants had a mean (SD) age of 50.7 (16.2) years; 55.8% (41,771) were female, 70.6% (52,826) were White, and 19.0% (14,222) were Black. Among the interventions, 5 of 19 (26.3%) had a significantly greater vaccination rate than control. On average, the 19 interventions increased vaccination relative to control by 1.8 percentage points or 6.1% (P =.005). The top performing text message described the vaccine to the patient as “reserved for you” and led to a 3.1 percentage point increase (95% CI, 1.3 to 4.9; P <.001) in vaccination relative to control. Three of the top five performing messages described the vaccine as “reserved for you.” None of the interventions performed worse than control. Conclusions: Text messages encouraging vaccination and delivered prior to an upcoming appointment significantly increased influenza vaccination rates and could be a scalable approach to increase vaccination more broadly. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Background: The side effects of the FIFA 11+ program on performance have not been generally reviewed. The objective of this study was to synthesize the literature on the effects of the 11+ on players’ performance. Methods: Five online databases (PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, Springer, and Google Scholar) were searched (from April 2006 to March 2022) using predefined keywords and sub-keywords. The potential references were primarily recorded through Endnote and imported to Covidence. Out of the 123 references screened by 2 blinded researchers through the software, 59 full texts were assessed for eligibility, 33 of which were ultimately included. The quality of the studies and the risk of bias were then assessed. Study ID, title, place, aim, design, start/end dates, population description, study criteria, statistical analysis, and outcomes were extracted. Results: Studies were conducted on male and female players aged 10–32 years old. The quality of the studies was moderate to high, and except for unclear bias for blinding outcome assessment, the risk of bias for all domains was low. Long-term application of the 11+ improved most biomechanical measures and physiological responses except for lower extremity stability, ankle evertors time latency, ankle dorsiflexion, and proprioception. Conversely, the 11+ showed acute negative effects on physical performance compared to dynamic warm-ups and non-significant effects on technical abilities. Conclusion: Mid-to-long-term implementation of the 11+ improved the majority of biomechanical and a couple of physical measures but showed no effects on technical skills. Precaution must be observed for using the 11+ before competitions, as it could acutely decrease physical/technical performance. Given the contradictory nature of the literature, further studies should evaluate the short-to-mid-term effects of the 11+. Further studies are required to address ankle responses to the 11+ intervention. © 2022"
"Purpose: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is an increasingly important issue for service brands in fast fashion retailing, as consumers' negative impressions about retailers' CSR activities influence brand experience. Consumers' impressions of CSR efforts arise based on agendas communicated through many channels from different sources. The paper unravels the ‘wrinkles’, i.e. possible mismatches in CSR communication around service brands by studying differences between the three main sources of fast fashion brand-related CSR agendas: Autonomous company communication, news media and social media postings by consumers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors use structural topic modeling (STM) to analyze a corpus of texts focusing on the CSR efforts of three major fast fashion service brands over three years. The texts included 89 items of company communication (CSR reports and press releases), 5,351 news media articles about the brands' CSR efforts and 57,377 consumer generated tweets about the brands. Findings: The STM analysis extracted 26 different CRS-related topics from the texts. Results showed differences in how much the three sources emphasized topics. The brands' own communication puts emphasis on environmental responsibility. News media tended to report on economic issues, treatment of employees and specific CSR-related events. Twitter showed more activity in discussing incident-based and emotionally charged topics. Research limitations/implications: The results feed into the ongoing discussion about how companies' CSR communication relates to communication in the press and among consumers. The authors highlight themes in the individual topics that are emphasized by the three sources, and discuss how CSR themes emerge in the overall transformative agenda. Practical implications: The paper highlights how fast fashion service brands can identify and understand different CSR agendas arising around their brand. Insight into such agendas can be used to tailor the brands' communication strategies. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the understanding of the factors behind fashion service brands' CSR reputation, highlighting how the three main sources of CSR reputation (company reports, news and social media) emphasize different types of agendas. © 2022, Jacob Mickelsson, Joep J.G.M. van Haren and Jos G.A.M.

"Food is significant to human daily life. In this paper, we are interested in learning structural representations for lengthy recipes, that can benefit the recipe generation and food cross-modal retrieval tasks. Different from the common vision-language data, here the food images contain mixed ingredients and target recipes are lengthy paragraphs, where we do not have annotations on structure information. To address the above limitations, we propose a novel method to unsupervisedly learn the sentence-level tree structures for the cooking recipes. Our approach brings together several novel ideas in a systematic framework: (1) exploiting an unsupervised learning approach to obtain the sentence-level tree structure labels before training; (2) generating trees of target recipes from images with the supervision of tree structure labels learned from (1); and (3) integrating the learned tree structures into the recipe generation and food cross-modal retrieval procedure. Our proposed model can produce good-quality sentence-level tree structures and coherent recipes. We achieve the state-of-the-art recipe generation and food cross-modal retrieval performance on the benchmark Recipe1M dataset. © 1979-2012 IEEE."
"This study explored adolescents' experiences of being under pressure to sext (sending nude images), offering insights into what situations adolescents view as pressuring, how adolescents react to the pressure, and what counter-strategies they use. Written statements from 225 adolescents (age 13–16 years, M = 14.4 years, SD = 0.93) were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results indicated a range of situations including both explicit and implicit pressure. The pressure elicited different emotional responses, including severe physical and psychological reactions, becoming distressed, and being seemingly unconcerned. A majority of the adolescents reported successful strategies on how to ward off the unwanted sexual requests. This study provides insight into how young people cope with potentially harmful situations online. © 2022 The Authors.

"With the rapid development of the Internet and the World Wide Web, and the increasing amounts and variety of information on the Internet, people can now use search engines to obtain a diverse rich range of information. This paper proposes a user intent prediction search engine system (UIPSES) based on query history, using machine learning and deep learning image recognition technologies. Two different search methods are developed, based on a user keyword search and an upload image file search. The upload image file search uses deep learning image recognition technology to obtain multiple intent features for the image. Both the keyword and image searches use machine learning technology to extract multiple search intent feature information from the search logs, which is used as a basis for creating a user intent prediction for the keyword information search and the image file search. UIPSES provides highly correlated website index information between user browsing and predicted intent behaviour and uses machine learning to periodically train each user search process to update the user search intent recognition model to adapt to changes in the user intent, to improve the overall inference performance and analyse the accuracy of UIPSES, and to realise a search engine system with personalisation and a high-quality user experience. The UIPSES is a novel image search system that compares the relevance of search engine results for image and text information by using mean average precision with the well-known advanced web image search engines (Google, Bing, and Yandex). When the user uploads an image file for a search, the highest mean average precision value achieved by these three web image search engines was 2.28% for image information and text information feedback. In contrast, UIPSES can adapt to different conditions for single-object or multi-object images searches by obtaining multiple features from images and making inferences based on search logs, and therefore achieves high mean average precision values of 82.57 and 98.28%. UIPSES can also accurately find preset image and text information with higher relevance to allow users to search for images. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the distribution system has caused interference with the signals stimulated by high impedance faults (HIFs). Many existing HIF detection or location methods that are only based on the superficial nonlinearity features of signals rather than the deep laws, will become invalid. This paper proposes a detection and location scheme for HIFs by theoretically analyzing the relationships between signals and systems. By establishing the equivalent circuit of a resonant distribution system, an online method to calculate the kernel system parameters is proposed, based on which an adaptive criterion for HIF detection is provided. In this way, the ability to detect HIF is adequately exploited and independent of DER influences. The method is able to detect HIF over 8.5 $\text{k}{\Omega }$ under common operating conditions. Furthermore, the nonlinearity of HIF is analyzed by deriving laws about how wideband signals distribute in the system. The $3^{\mathrm{ rd}}$ harmonic component of zero-sequence signals is proved to be superior in HIF location in terms of signal content and discrimination, which is also demonstrated to be valid under the influence of DER harmonic injection. On this basis, a HIF location method utilizing the $3^{\mathrm{ rd}}$ harmonic zero-sequence signals is proposed. The effectiveness of the method and its robustness to the DER interference are validated by simulated and field HIFs in 10kV systems.  © 2010-2012 IEEE."
"In this paper, we present a review of studies that have collected and annotated errors produced by people with dyslexia from corpora of written texts (six studies involving English, Spanish, German and French). Such resources are useful for studying the spelling difficulties of people with dyslexia. Results can be used for the design and development of assistive technologies. This paper also presents our contribution: a new study of errors from two corpora of typed texts written by French-speaking people with dyslexia. It details the methodology used to annotate the spelling errors extracted from these corpora and the analysis of these errors. The results of our study are compared to the results of the previous studies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Data preprocessing is among the principal stages in virtually all text-based tasks. In this light, recent approaches have employed word embeddings in the majority of text-based tasks, wherein word co-occurrences are used as the basis of word vector generation processes in the approaches thereof. Word embedding techniques are primarily trained on large corpora. The preprocessing of said corpora is quite crucial in that it can alter the co-occurrence counts of words, and hence the quality of generated word vectors. This highlights the significance of selecting the right preprocessing approach when working with word embeddings. The present study proceeds to scrutinize the effects of preprocessing on the quality of word embeddings on Persian and English corpora, with a focus on preprocessing approaches capable of altering the co-occurrence counts of words by virtue of procedures such as the elimination of stopwords. The quality of the word vectors generated employing different types of preprocessing are intrinsically evaluated by word similarity and word analogy. Text classification and sentiment analysis are also used as extrinsic evaluations. The study also presents four word similarity datasets for Persian, namely PER-RG-65, PER-RC-30, PER-simlex-999, and PER-Mturk-287. Results obtained using GloVe, Word2vec (CBOW), and Fasttext word embeddings show that in certain tasks, such as in the case of text classification or solving semantic questions in word analogy, the removal of punctuations and stopwords will lead to higher performance, as in the case of sentiment analysis and syntactic questions regarding word analogy, where withholding stopwords increases overall performance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Effective mining of social media, which consists of a large number of users is a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on the analysis of text data related to users to accomplish this task. However, text data lacks significant information about the social users and their associated groups. In this paper, we propose CommuNety, a deep learning system for the prediction of cohesive networks using face images from photo albums. The proposed deep learning model consists of hierarchical CNN architecture to learn descriptive features related to each cohesive network. The paper also proposes a novel Face Co-occurrence Frequency algorithm to quantify existence of people in images, and a novel photo ranking method to analyze the strength of relationship between different individuals in a predicted social network. We extensively evaluate the proposed technique on PIPA dataset and compare with state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique for the prediction of relationship between different individuals and the cohesiveness of communities. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Offensive content or hate speech is defined as any form of communication that aims to annoy, harass, disturb, or anger an individual or community based on factors such as faith, ethnicity, appearance, or sexuality. Nowadays, offensive content posted in regional languages increased due to the popularity of social networks and other apps usage by common people. This work proposes a method to detect and identify hate speech or offensive content in Tamil. We have used the HASOC 2021 data set that contains YouTube comments in Tamil language and written in Tamil script. In this research work, an attempt is made to find suitable embedding techniques for Tamil text representation by applying TF-IDF and pre-trained transformer models like BERT, XLM-RoBERTa, IndicBERT, mBERT, TaMillion, and MuRIL. As Tamil is a morphologically rich language, a detailed analysis is made to study the performance of hate speech detection in Tamil by applying enhanced stemming algorithms. An extensive experimental study was performed with different classifiers such as logistic regression, SVM, stochastic Gradient Descent, decision tree, and ensemble learning models in combination with the above techniques. The results of this detailed experimental study show that stop word removal produces mixed results and does not guarantee improvement in the performance of the classifier to detect offensive content for Tamil data. However, the performance on stemmed data shows a significant improvement over un-stemmed data in Tamil texts. As the data is highly imbalanced, we also combined an oversampling/downsampling technique to analyze its role in designing the best offensive classifier for Tamil text. The highest performance was achieved by a combination of stemming the text data, embedding it with the multi-lingual model MuRIL and using a majority voting ensemble as the downstream classifier. We have achieved the F1-score of 84% and accuracy of 86% for detecting offensive content in Tamil YouTube comments. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"The delay-causing text data contain valuable information such as the specific reasons for the delay, location and time of the disturbance, which can provide an efficient support for the prediction of train delays and improve the guidance of train control efficiency. Based on the train operation data and delay-causing data of the Wuhan–Guangzhou high-speed railway, the relevant algorithms in the natural language processing field are used to process the delay-causing text data. It also integrates the train operating-environment information and delay-causing text information so as to develop a cause-based train delay propagation prediction model. The Word2vec model is first used to vectorize the delay-causing text description after word segmentation. The mean model or the term frequency-inverse document frequency-weighted model is then used to generate the delay-causing sentence vector based on the original word vector. Afterward, the train operating-environment features and delay-causing sentence vector are input into the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) regression algorithm to develop a delay propagation prediction model. In this work, 4 text feature processing methods and 8 regression algorithms are considered. The results demonstrate that the XGBoost regression algorithm has the highest prediction accuracy using the test features processed by the continuous bag of words and the mean models. Compared with the prediction model that only considers the train-operating-environment features, the results show that the prediction accuracy of the model is significantly improved with multiple regression algorithms after integrating the delay-causing feature. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Objective: To map the existing evidence regarding the masking ability of resin composites. Overview: The literature search was conducted electronically, based on the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews—online protocol at https://osf.io/m2h67/ with no language or time restrictions. Two independent reviewers conducted the screening, and a third reviewer was consulted in case of disagreement. Studies that evaluated resin composite masking ability regardless of background, application technique, thickness, or number of layers were selected. The search found 2995 potentially eligible studies. After removal of duplicates (657), irrelevant articles (2323), 15 citations met the eligibility criteria based on title and abstract, and eight studies were included based on full text analysis (seven in vitro, and one case report). Acceptable masking ability is obtained by one layer of opaque shade resin composite or by the layering technique. A black background is masked with 1.0- to 2.0 mm-thick layers of opaque shade resin composites. Masking of the C4 background is achieved with one layer of 0.5- to 1.5 mm-thick opaque shade resin composite or by the layering technique using different combinations of enamel body and dentin shades with a final thickness of 1.5 mm. Conclusions: Acceptable masking of C4 shade background is achieved with one layer of opaque shade composite at least 0.5 mm-thick or by different combinations of the layering technique, with a final thickness of 1.5 mm. Acceptable masking of the black background of the oral cavity is achieved with a resin composite of at least 1.0 mm opaque shade. Clinical Significance: The thickness of the resin composite layer required to achieve adequate masking is variable and depends on the translucency/opacity of the tested resin composites and the background shade. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Attention towards veg*nism is increasing as the impact of food choices on health and sustainability as well as ethical concerns regarding animal welfare emerge. Although online user analysis is an effective tool to obtain practical insights without geographical constraints, implementation on a large veg*n population has been carried out within a limited scope. This study investigated two veg*n subreddits, r/Vegan and r/Vegetarian, using multiple text mining techniques to classify users' interests and preferences. Based on K-means and term frequency-inverse document frequency, six clusters were identified: Food, Perception, Health, Altruism, Emotion, and Situation. The proportion of each cluster and keywords representing the clusters were obtained. Being a major sector, further assessment of the Food cluster was conducted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic modeling technique. Confusion was observed in relation to being pressured with sudden changes in dietary patterns, including meal composition, preparation, and shopping routines. The results also revealed barriers to transition for individuals who have recently started veg*n diets, and those wishing to switch to stricter dietary patterns. In addition to difficulties relating to economic and social aspects, our findings suggest that the establishment of detailed guidelines may help accommodate the various dietary compositions across the veg*n spectrum, and clear information relating to veg*n food products is needed from manufacturers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Background: Enhanced uptake of systematic reviews that use qualitative comparative analyses (QCA) requires knowing how end-users interpret such findings. The study purpose was to identify effective approaches to communicating results from a QCA within a systematic review. Methods: Sequential exploratory mixed methods design; thematic analysis of interviews with 11 end-users followed by a randomized experiment with 254 participants that provided QCA results for a hypothetical review presented through three formats (text, table, and figure). A survey administered after the experiment assessed subjective and objective comprehension of QCA results. Results: Interview themes included use of jargon; appropriate use of appendices, tables, figures; and integration of QCA results within the systematic review. In the experiment, we observed a significant difference (p = 0.035) in subjective comprehension across the three presentation formats. Participants randomized to the figure and text formats scored higher compared to the table. No significant differences were observed for objective comprehension overall (p = 0.11). However, for parameter interpretation (a unique component of QCA results), scores among participants that received the figure format were significantly higher than scores for participants who received the text (p = 0.001) or table (p = 0.004). No significant differences (p = 0.09) were observed in objective comprehension for configuration interpretation. Conclusions: End-users of systematic reviews saw value in the use of QCA, but unfamiliar methods and terminology were barriers to full understanding of the findings. When presenting results, a figure format appears to be superior to text or table formats based on measures of subjective comprehension and some measures of objective comprehension. © 2022 The Authors.

"The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has changed consumer usage behavior towards mobile payment (m-payment) services. Consumer usage behavior towards m-payment services continues to increase due to access to usage experiences shared through online consumer reviews (OCRs). The proliferation of massive OCRs, coupled with quick and effective decisions concerning the evaluation and selection of m-payment services, is a practical issue for research. This paper develops a novel decision evaluation model that integrates OCRs and multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) with probabilistic linguistic information to identify m-payment usage attributes and utilize these attributes to evaluate and rank m-payment services. First and foremost, the attributes of m-payment usage discussed by consumers in OCRs are extracted using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling approach. These key attributes are used as the evaluation scales in the MADM. Based on an unsupervised sentiment algorithm, the sentiment scores of the text reviews regarding the attributes are calculated. We convert the sentiment scores into probabilistic linguistic elements based on the probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) theory and statistical analysis. Furthermore, we construct a novel technique known as probabilistic linguistic indifference threshold-based attribute ratio analysis (PL-ITARA) to discover the weight importance of the usage attributes. Subsequently, the positive and negative ideal-based PL-ELECTRE I methodology is proposed to evaluate and rank m-payment services. Finally, a case study on selecting appropriate m-payment services in Ghana is examined to authenticate the validity and applicability of our proposed decision evaluation methodology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Automated sentiment analysis is considered an area in natural language processing research that seeks to understand a text author's mood, thoughts, and feelings. New opportunities and challenges have arisen in this field due to the popularity and accessibility of a variety of resources of ideas, such as online review websites, personal blogs, and social media. Feature selection, which can be conducted using metaheuristic algorithms, is one of the steps of sentiment analysis. It is crucial to use high-performing algorithms for feature selection. This paper applies the Horse herd Optimisation Algorithm (HOA) for feature selection in text sentiment analysis. HOA is a metaheuristic algorithm and uses six key behaviours to simulate the social performance of horses of various ages, to solve high-dimensional optimisation problems. In order to improve HOA, this paper adds another behaviour of horses to the basic algorithm; thus, the new algorithm uses seven key behaviours of horses of different ages to imitate their social performance. It is then discretised and converted to a multi-objective algorithm. The improved algorithm's performance is evaluated using 15 CEC benchmark functions, and the results are compared to the Binary Social Spider Algorithm, the Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer, and the Binary Butterfly Optimization Algorithm. The new algorithm, the Multi-objective Binary Horse herd Optimisation Algorithm (MBHOA), excels at solving high-dimensional complex problems. To evaluate the algorithm's performance in feature selection, as a practical example, it is employed in text sentiment analysis and examined on various data sets. The simulation results indicate that MBHOA has a better performance in analysing sentiment compared to similar approaches. © 2022, The Author(s)."

"In terms of thought disorder, the language of patients with schizophrenia itself could be a valuable resource. Some valuable studies on the language of patients with schizophrenia have been performed. However, most such studies have been confined to English-speaking countries, or at least those where Indo-European languages are spoken. Therefore, we investigated linguistic anomalies in the language of Korean patients with schizophrenia. Short texts written by 69 patients with schizophrenia from a single mental hospital and matched normal control participants were analyzed. We evaluated these texts in terms of semantic and syntactic errors. Then, we compared the error rates adjusted for text length between patients and normal control participants. We also divided the patients with schizophrenia into two groups by their duration of illness and compared these two groups to investigate the relationship between the duration of illness and linguistic anomalies. The patients with schizophrenia committed a total of 1.86 (2.52) semantic errors and 1.37 (1.79) syntactic errors per 100 characters, which were significantly more frequent than errors committed by normal control participants. Furthermore, there was a notably high number of semantic errors relative to syntactic errors in the language of patients with schizophrenia. Our study results are consistent with previous studies from English-speaking countries, implying that the linguistic anomalies of patients with schizophrenia are not confined to a single language. Because language is essential in mental function, further research on linguistic anomalies in patients with schizophrenia is recommended. © 2022"
"Background: Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (hereafter referred to as Aboriginal) women breastfeed at lower rates than non-Aboriginal women. Little is known about factors associated with breastfeeding specific to Aboriginal women and infants. Aim: Determine the protective and risk factors associated with breastfeeding for Aboriginal women in Australia. Methods: CINAHL, Medline, EMBASE, SCOPUS, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane library were searched for peer-reviewed literature published between 1995 and 2021. Quantitative studies written in English reporting protective and risk factors associated with breastfeeding for Aboriginal women or women having an Aboriginal infant were included. Ten percent of papers were co-screened, and two reviewers completed data extraction. Narrative data synthesis was used. Findings: The initial search identified 12,091 records, with 31 full text studies retrieved, and 17 reports from 14 studies met inclusion criteria. Protective factors included living in a remote area, attending an Aboriginal-specific service, attending a regional service, higher levels of education attainment, increased maternal age, living in larger households, being partnered, and having a higher reported number of stressful events and social health issues. The identified risk factors were smoking in pregnancy, admission to SCN or NICU, and being multiparous. Conclusion: This review identified factors associated with breastfeeding for Aboriginal women. Government focus, support, and consistent funding are required to plan and implement evidence-based interventions and services for Aboriginal women and infants in urban, rural, remote, and very remote locations. Rigorous research is required to understand the Aboriginal-specific factors associated with breastfeeding to improve rates and health outcomes for Aboriginal women and infants. © 2022 Australian College of Midwives"
"The fast evolution of Information and Digital technology had given way for internet to be an effective medium for communication. This has also paved way for data exploitation. Therefore, users must protect their data from misuse. This led to the emergence of security framework like Information Hiding. Steganography and Steganalysis are of the two primary techniques in the field of Information Hiding. Steganography is the science of concealing confidential information, while steganalysis is the art of detecting the existence of that information. The primary goal of this research is to address the general concept of steganalysis, and various breaches associated with it. It involves a blind statistical steganalysis technique that is led in Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) text embedded images by extracting features that illustrate an alteration during an embedding. The images used as embedding medium are uncalibrated and the percentage of the embedding used in this study is 50%. The text embedding is done using various steganographic schemes in the spatial and transform domain. The steganographic schemes considered are Least Significant Bit (LSB) Matching, Least Significant Bit (LSB) Replacement, Pixel Value Differencing and F5. After steganographic embedding of the data, the first order, second order, extended Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Markov features are extracted. Then, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is used as a system for feature dimensionality reduction. Furthermore, the technique of machine learning is incorporated by means of a classifier to identify the stego image and cover image. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Support Vector Machine with Particle Swarm Optimization (SVM-PSO) are the classifiers examined in this paper for a comparative study. Moreover, the concept of cross-validation is also incorporated in this work. Six dissimilar kernel functions and four diverse samplings are used during classification to check on the effectiveness of the kernels and sampling in classification. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"National identity is the cognition of citizens regarding to which political community they belong, and the tendency to accept the political, cultural and ethnic values of the state. Previous studies have found that national identity is heterogeneous at the subnational levels. Why do people hold different degrees of nationalism and patriotism in the subnational units? In this paper, we offer a political economic explanation of national identity, which links the state capacity with political attitudes. We employ a nationalism-patriotism framework to decompose the concept of national identity, then use the supervised learning approach to measure nationalism and patriotism based on a massive number of Weibo posts dating from 2011 to 2017. Automated text analysis shows that the state capacity plays an important role preventing the national identity from being weakened by globalization and the diversity of social information. Specifically, with the progress of China’s globalization, multiculturalism and various information have crossed the national boundaries, which undermines China’s national identity. In order to maintain this identity, the Chinese government utilizes its redistribution capacity to reinforce both nationalism and patriotism, and also its information capacity to strengthen nationalism. © 2022, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies."
"Fighting medical disinformation in the era of the pandemic is an increasingly important problem. Today, automatic systems for assessing the credibility of medical information do not offer sufficient precision, so human supervision and the involvement of medical expert annotators are required. Our work aims to optimize the utilization of medical experts’ time. We also equip them with tools for semi-automatic initial verification of the credibility of the annotated content. We introduce a general framework for filtering medical statements that do not require manual evaluation by medical experts, thus focusing annotation efforts on non-credible medical statements. Our framework is based on the construction of filtering classifiers adapted to narrow thematic categories. This allows medical experts to fact-check and identify over two times more non-credible medical statements in a given time interval without applying any changes to the annotation flow. We verify our results across a broad spectrum of medical topic areas. We perform quantitative, as well as exploratory analysis on our output data. We also point out how those filtering classifiers can be modified to provide experts with different types of feedback without any loss of performance. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Jokes are indispensable to Slavoj Žižek’s commentaries and theoretical reflexions on politics and culture. However, contrary, or in addition, to their putative radical meaning and their capacity to render clear certain ideological practices, some of these jokes seem to raise serious questions in relation to their politics. The current article will focus on three texts by Žižek, all of which contain a joke or pun, in order to examine the function of these jokes on a microsociological level, that is, in relation to speaker/audience dynamics, as well as exploring the broader politics they advocate and they invite us to embrace. A Lacanian discourse analysis is employed in order to open up these texts and jokes and discuss what is understood as their ideological character and disciplinary function. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"This study grows out of the absence of literature on an in-depth understanding of dissertation-writing challenges, facilitating strategies, and causes to develop a more profound understanding of Pakistani doctoral students. This is primarily qualitative research. One of the largest private universities was selected as a case to collect the data. The data were based on 12 Pakistani doctoral dissertations, 49 evaluation reports from 13 countries, mainly from the state-run universities, and a survey questionnaire responded to by 12 PhD graduates. The data were codified for commonly emerging categories and themes based on the methodological approach of Clarke and Braun (2017). The data revealed that the doctoral students faced challenges concerning mechanics of writing, developing an argument in a coherent whole, and structural organization of the dissertation. The examiners recommended the doctoral students to copyedit/proofread the dissertation to overcome mechanics of writing problems, build the argument logically, use formal language, write transition sentences to knit the texts coherently, embed citations to support the claims, and uniform the structure of the dissertation. Five causes of writing difficulties emerged from the survey questions. Despite a mismatch between the academic resources and research support provided to Pakistani doctoral students, their research work is deemed par with foreign universities, which encourage native-like English. It is hoped that this study will help doctoral students improve their dissertation-writing quality. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Background and objective: Decreased skeletal muscle mass and quality are one of the several markers used for sarcopenia diagnosis and are generally associated with increased rates of post-operative infections, poorer recovery and increased mortality. The aim of this review was to evaluate methods applied to detect markers of sarcopenia and the associated outcomes for patients undergoing emergency laparotomy. Methods: This review was conducted with reference to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. MEDLINE, Embase and Google Scholar databases were searched. Studies detecting patients with sarcopenia or skeletal muscle decline markers and the associated outcomes after emergency laparotomy surgery were considered. The Newcastle–Ottawa Scale was used to evaluate publication quality. Results: Out of 103 studies, which were screened, 19 full-text records were reviewed and 7 studies were ultimately analyzed. The study cohort sizes ranged from n = 46 to n = 967. The age range was 36–95 years. There were 1107 females (53%) and 973 males (47%) across all 7 studies. All studies measured psoas muscle mass and three studies assessed psoas muscle quality using computerized tomography (CT) imaging. No study assessed muscle strength or function, while five studies showed an association between low muscle mass and increased mortality rates after emergency laparotomy. Among the three studies, which assessed muscle quality, two of three studies showed poorer 30-day survival rates. Conclusions: The existing literature is limited, however it indicates that low psoas muscle mass and quality markers are associated with increased 30-day mortality rates after emergency laparotomy. Therefore, muscle markers can be used as a new feasible tool to identify most at risk patients requiring further interventions. © The Finnish Surgical Society 2022."
"Sentiment analysis (SA) has gained much traction In the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP). There is growing demand to automate analysis of user sentiment towards products or services. Opinions are increasingly being shared online in the form of videos rather than text alone. This has led to SA using multiple modalities, termed Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA), becoming an important research area. MSA utilises latest advancements in machine learning and deep learning at various stages including for multimodal feature extraction and fusion and sentiment polarity detection, with aims to minimize error rate and improve performance. This survey paper examines primary taxonomy and newly released multimodal fusion architectures. Recent developments in MSA architectures are divided into ten categories, namely early fusion, late fusion, hybrid fusion, model-level fusion, tensor fusion, hierarchical fusion, bi-modal fusion, attention-based fusion, quantum-based fusion and word-level fusion. A comparison of several architectural evolutions in terms of MSA fusion categories and their relative strengths and limitations are presented. Finally, a number of interdisciplinary applications and future research directions are proposed. © 2022"
"Impact investing is gaining momentum as an investment practice that optimizes both financial and social outcomes. However, the market is still in its emerging stage, and there is ambiguity regarding the definition of players and practices. In this paper, we adopt an investor identity perspective and use a linguistic approach to explore how social impact venture capitalists (SIVCs) communicate their identities and actions to their external stakeholders. Through a text mining analysis of the websites of 195 investors worldwide, our results reveal four types of investors who differ in terms of their social linguistic positioning and linguistic distinctiveness. Finally, by training a tree boosting machine learning model, we assess the extent to which the use of different linguistic styles is associated with website traffic. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"In the latest social networks, more and more people prefer to express their emotions in videos through text, speech, and rich facial expressions. Multimodal video emotion analysis techniques can help understand users' inner world automatically based on human expressions and gestures in images, tones in voices, and recognized natural language. However, in the existing research, the acoustic modality has long been in a marginal position as compared to visual and textual modalities. That is, it tends to be more difficult to improve the contribution of the acoustic modality for the whole multimodal emotion recognition task. Besides, although better performance can be obtained by introducing common deep learning methods, the complex structures of these training models always result in low inference efficiency, especially when exposed to high-resolution and long-length videos. Moreover, the lack of a fully end-to-end multimodal video emotion recognition system hinders its application. In this paper, we designed a fully multimodal video-to-emotion system (named FV2ES) for fast yet effective recognition inference, whose benefits are threefold: (1) The adoption of the hierarchical attention method upon the sound spectra breaks through the limited contribution of the acoustic modality, and outperforms the existing models' performance on both IEMOCAP and CMU-MOSEI datasets; (2) the introduction of the idea of multi-scale for visual extraction while single-branch for inference brings higher efficiency and maintains the prediction accuracy at the same time; (3) the further integration of data pre-processing into the aligned multimodal learning model allows the significant reduction of computational costs and storage space.  © 1963-12012 IEEE."
"Fake news is information that does not represent reality but is commonly shared on the internet as if it were true, mainly because of its dramatic, appealing, and controversial content. Therefore, a relevant issue is to find characteristics that can assist in identifying Fake News, mainly nowadays, where an increasing number of fake news is spread all over the internet every day. This work aims to extract knowledge from Brazilian fake news data based on statistical learning. Initially, an exploratory data analysis is performed for the available variables to extract insights from the differences between fake and true news. Then, the prediction and modelling are carried out. The learning phase aims to build a model and measure the features that best explain the behaviour of misleading texts, which leads to a parsimonious model. Finally, the test phase estimates the fitted model accuracy based on 10-fold cross-validation in the Monte Carlo framework. The results show that four variables are significant to explain fake news. Moreover, our model achieved comparable results with state-of-the-art, 0.941 F-measure, for a single classifier while having the advantage of being a parsimonious model.

"As a popular means of nonverbal communication in social media, emojis provide quick predictions about public sentiments towards social events. Previous analyses of emojis reported that people use positive emojis more frequently than negative emojis. However, psychological research reveals a negativity bias in sentiment, as seen in the phenomenon of loss-aversion, where negative sentiment due to a loss possesses a greater psychological valence than positive sentiment due to a gain of an equal amount. We propose that the frequency and intensity of emojis are dissociable. Whereas the frequency of emojis reflects social norms in public communication, the intensity reflects hedonic values and loss-aversion. We first developed a text-free emoji sentiment lexicon based on a survey with more than 900 users of Weibo (a Chinese version of Twitter). Using the sentiment lexicon, we then analyzed 8822 Weibo comments containing the indexed emojis in reaction to three controversial events (i.e., a murder case in which public opinion largely opposed the final verdict, a manslaughter case in which public opinion was supportive of the final verdict, and a public debate on an award-winning subject). The results showed that positive or negative emoji frequency was consistent with the majority sentiment (social norm) towards a controversial event. In contrast, the average intensity of negative emojis was stronger than positive emojis across all three samples, revealing a public sentiment version of loss-aversion. In all three samples, emoji polarity analysis served as a proxy for text sentiment analysis to capture public attitudes towards a social event. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Current lexica and machine learning based sentiment analysis approaches still suffer from a two-fold limitation. First, manual lexicon construction and machine training is time consuming and error-prone. Second, the prediction’s accuracy entails sentences and their corresponding training text should fall under the same domain. In this article, we experimentally evaluate four sentiment classifiers, namely support vector machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR) and random forest (RF). We quantify the quality of each of these models using three real-world datasets that comprise 50,000 movie reviews, 10,662 sentences, and 300 generic movie reviews. Specifically, we study the impact of a variety of natural language processing (NLP) pipelines on the quality of the predicted sentiment orientations. Additionally, we measure the impact of incorporating lexical semantic knowledge captured by WordNet on expanding original words in sentences. Findings demonstrate that the utilizing different NLP pipelines and semantic relationships impacts the quality of the sentiment analyzers. In particular, results indicate that coupling lemmatization and knowledge-based n-gram features proved to produce higher accuracy results. With this coupling, the accuracy of the SVM classifier has improved to 90.43%, while it was 86.83%, 90.11%, 86.20%, respectively using the three other classifiers. © 2023, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

"With growing attention on the importance of values, beliefs and worldviews in shaping environmental outcomes, there remains little research on religion and sustainability transformations. We explored the impact of the Archbishop of Canterbury’s environmentally themed Lent Book 2020 “Saying Yes to Life” on environmental values, attitudes and behaviours of lay Christians. An online survey administered before and after reading the book assessed environmental values, New Ecological Paradigm (NEP), connectedness to nature and environmental behaviours, and collected open responses to questions about participants’ perceptions. Follow-up focus groups were also held to understand experiences of cognitive and behavioural change. Analysis of paired data revealed significant increases in environmental behavioural intentions after completing the book, especially for energy use, food and recycling. Some evidence for strengthening of NEP scores and connectedness to nature was also found. Open text responses corroborated with quantitative measures of behaviour change. Additionally, the majority of participants reported some form of reinforcement, confirmation, or further development or change in their beliefs and attitudes. This included a reduction in anthropocentric beliefs and greater appreciation of and obligation towards the natural world. Focus group discussions revealed diverse participant experiences, including having pre-existing theological beliefs affirmed, responding with new practical actions, connecting with spiritual experiences, and discovering systemic origins of unsustainability. Findings suggest potential for environmental interventions within religious contexts to shape mindsets, integrate theological views with environmental concerns, activate latent beliefs, and initiate and sustain pro-environmental behaviour. More intentional engagement with religion may facilitate transformative change for sustainability internally and externally, and across individual, organisational and societal domains. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Background: The reproductive and perinatal health of sexual and gender-diverse (SGD) individuals is a research priority area for the National Institutes of Health. Over the past decade, this childbearing population has been the focus of several qualitative studies providing the opportunity to evaluate and synthesize the qualitative literature on SGD childbearing experiences in a metasynthesis. Methods: We conducted a literature search of four databases to identify original research published from January 2011 through June 2021. These results were augmented by forward and backward searching strategies. Two authors independently screened studies. All qualitative studies of the childbearing experience were eligible. Data were extracted and inductively coded using conventional content analysis, and studies underwent a quality appraisal by two authors. Results: From 2396 articles, 127 full-text articles were screened, and 25 were included in this synthesis. Three overarching themes were identified: (a) Systematic Invisibility; (b) Creating Personhood Through Parenthood; and (c) Resilient Narratives of Childbearing. Conclusions: Relative to heterosexual and cisgender parents, SGD childbearing parents experience unique structural and interpersonal challenges and employ critically important resilience strategies and coping techniques to manage an overwhelming heterocisnormative experience. These findings provide an important target for health care organizations and professionals to improve SGD perinatal health. In addition, this metasynthesis identified persistent gaps in our understanding of this marginalized childbearing population, which have important implications for reducing health disparities that SGD parents experience. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Background: Health care-associated infection (HAI) is a common adverse event affecting patient safety. This review aims to (1) establish evidence for the impact of certified infection prevention and control (CIC) specialists on infection prevention and patient safety in acute care settings and (2) summarize study design and statistical modeling used for impact assessment to inform future studies. Methods: We searched and reviewed full-text, quantitative studies assessing the impact of CIC. The studies used empirical data published in English between January 2000 and April 2021 in PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. We identified 8 articles for data extraction and analysis. All eight studies used a cross-sectional design and had a quality rating of good to high based on the Johns Hopkins Nursing Evidence-Based Practice rating scales. Results: CIC infection preventionists (IPs) may have a stronger understanding than other practitioners of the evidence for certain infection prevention practices and are more likely to recommend implementing them in the hospitals where they work, especially when the lead IP is certified. The association between CIC and HAI rates was inconsistent in our results. Discussion and Conclusions: Further studies are needed to explore the impact of CIC IPs on HAI rates. © 2022 Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc."
"Aspect-level sentiment analysis (ALSA) is the process of collecting, processing, analyzing, inferring, and synthesizing subjective sentiments of entities contained in texts at the aspect level. The development of social networks has been driven by the on-going appearance of vast numbers of short documents, such as those in which opinions are expressed and comments are made. The text in these documents reflects users’ emotions related to entities. The ALSA of these short texts plays an important role in solving various problems in life. Particularly in e-commerce, manufacturers can use sentiment analysis to determine users’ orientations, adapt their products to perfection, identify potential users, and pinpoint users that influence other users. Therefore, improving the performance of ALSA methods has recently attracted the interest of researchers. Currently, four main types of ALSA methods are available: knowledge-based, machine learning-based, hybrid-based, and most recently, graph convolutional network (GCN)-based. This study is the first survey to focus on reviewing the proposed methods for ALSA using GCN methods. In this paper, we propose a novel taxonomy to divide GCN-based ALSA models into three categories based on the types of knowledge extraction. We present and compare GCN-based ALSA methods following our taxonomy comprehensively. Common benchmark datasets and text representations that are often used in GCN-based methods are also discussed. In addition, we discuss five challenges and suggest seven future research directions for GCN-based ALSA methods. The findings of our survey are expected to provide the necessary guidelines for beginners, practitioners, and new researchers to improve the performance of ALSA methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Relapse in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Utility of ANCA for prediction of relapses is still controversial. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and WebOfScience were searched, screened and confirmed for inclusion [PROSPERO No: CRD42020220308]. Studies measuring serial ANCA by ELISA or indirect immunofluorescence (IF), reporting relapses with sufficient data to calculate sensitivity and specificity were included. Diagnostic odds ratio (OR), sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratios (LR) were synthesized using a bivariate mixed-effect regression model. Sub-group analysis included a comparison between ELISA and IIF, anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) and -proteinase 3(PR3), and type of rise in ANCA. For meta-analysis of survival outcomes, hazard ratios were synthesized using a random-effect model. QUADAS-2 was used for assessing quality of studies, I2 statistic for heterogeneity Begg’s test for publication bias. 2946 abstracts and 43 full-texts were reviewed to identify 26 eligible studies that included 2623 patients with AAV and 848 relapses. Overall heterogeneity was high [I2 = 99%] and the overall risk of bias was low to moderate. ANCA positivity by either ELISA or immunofluorescence for predicting relapse of AAV had a sensitivity of 0.70(95% CI 0.58–0.81), specificity of 0.66(0.55–0.76), positive LR of 2.1(1.6–42.7) and negative LR of 0.44(0.30–0.60). ELISA performed marginally better [OR: 5(3–7)] than IIF [OR: 4(2–9)] with similar sensitivity, specificity, PLR and NLR. The area under the curve for PR3 was 0.74(0.7–0.77), while that for MPO was not computed as the number of eligible studies was only three. In the survival analysis, the hazard ratio for relapse was 3.11(1.7–5.65). The meta-analysis shows modest accuracy of ANCA in predicting relapses of ANCA vasculitis and supports the use of serial ANCA monitoring as a biomarker for relapse. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Objective: To accelerate the use of outcome measures in rheumatology, we developed and evaluated a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline for extracting these measures from free-text outpatient rheumatology notes within the American College of Rheumatology's Rheumatology Informatics System for Effectiveness (RISE) registry. Methods: We included all patients in RISE (2015–2018). The NLP pipeline extracted scores corresponding to 8 measures of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity (DA) and functional status (FS) documented in outpatient rheumatology notes. Score extraction performance was evaluated by chart review, and we assessed agreement with scores documented in structured data. We conducted an external validation of our NLP pipeline using data from rheumatology notes from an academic medical center that is not included in the RISE registry. Results: We processed over 34 million notes from 854,628 patients, 158 practices, and 24 electronic health record (EHR) systems from RISE. Manual chart review revealed a sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and F1 score of 95%, 87%, and 91%, respectively. Substantial agreement was observed between scores extracted from RISE notes and scores derived from structured data (κ = 0.43–0.68 among DA and 0.86–0.98 among FS measures). In the external validation, we found a sensitivity, PPV, and F1 score of 92%, 69%, and 79%, respectively. Conclusion: We developed an NLP pipeline to extract RA outcome measures from a national registry of notes from multiple EHR systems and found it to have good internal and external validity. This pipeline can facilitate measurement of clinical- and patient-reported outcomes for use in research and quality measurement. © 2022 American College of Rheumatology."
"The smart speaker market, which is considered an early-stage market, is expected to grow rapidly as smart speakers become a part of daily life. Consequently, manufacturers are trying to dominate the market. To achieve this, they must analyze users' reactions to their products and find insights for product improvement through comparison with competitors. We propose a four-step methodological framework for identifying meaningful opinions from a large number of online user reviews. First, network analysis is conducted to compare differences between brands. Next, through topic modeling, the attributes of speakers that users consider the most crucial are extracted for each brand. Third, sentiment analysis is conducted to examine how users' emotional polarities differ for each attribute. Through this, product improvement and product sales plans can be derived. Finally, in order to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each brand, brand positioning is conducted and user opinions that have changed along with the evolution of the speaker's generation are analyzed. Our study identified the factors that positively or negatively affect the experience of smart speaker users. In addition, the proposed method is highly useful because it can be used to derive insights from a large amount of user opinion data regardless of the search term. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Text highlighting is a new method for online sensory-consumer research where participants read a text while making use of highlighting functions to indicate content that they, respectively, ‘like’ and ‘dislike.’ In a recent series of papers, consumers have been found to approach the text highlighting task in a logical and systematic manner, and the results have been shown to deliver attitudinal insights about the focal topic that fit expectations. Building on the early successes of text highlighting, it was an obvious step to try to extend it to applications in product research which occupies a central role in sensory-consumer research. A case study with kiwifruit was performed with consumers in Singapore and Malaysia (n = 1140). Participants read a text (288 words, 19 sentences) which primarily described sensory, nutrition and health characteristics of green and gold kiwifruit. Focusing on 43 specific fruit characteristics, sentiment (difference between the frequency of ‘like’ and ‘dislike’ highlights) was higher for nutrition and health characteristics than for those describing sensory characteristics. Only the Chinese origin of kiwifruit and the hairy skin of green kiwifruit were negatively perceived overall. A novel use of penalty/lift analysis to identify the specific fruit characteristics that significantly influenced expected liking of kiwifruit confirmed the results based on sentiment scores. Moreover, a difference between the drivers of liking for gold and green kiwifruit was identified; the use of ‘like’ highlighting for sensory properties positively contributed to expected liking for gold kiwifruit only. The case study also demonstrated the potential to meaningfully segment consumers based on their highlighting responses to product specific characteristics. The results are discussed in the context of future applications of text highlighting in product research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Purpose: Organoids are three-dimensional cultures of stem cells in an environment similar to the body’s extracellular matrix. This is also a novel development in the realm of regenerative medicine. Stem cells can begin to develop into 3D structures by modifying signaling pathways. To form organoids, stem cells are transplanted into the extracellular matrix. Organoids have provided the required technologies to reproduce human tissues. As a result, it might be used in place of animal models in scientific study. The key goals of these investigations are research into viral and genetic illnesses, malignancies, and extracellular vesicles, pharmaceutical discovery, and organ transplantation. Organoids can help pave the road for precision medicine through genetic editing, pharmaceutical development, and cell therapy. Methods: PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus were used to search for all relevant papers written in English (1907–2021). The study abstracts were scrutinized. Studies on the use of stem-cell-derived organoids in regenerative medicine, organoids as 3D culture models for EVs analysis, and organoids for precision medicine were included. Articles with other irrelevant aims, meetings, letters, commentaries, congress and conference abstracts, and articles with no available full texts were excluded. Results: According to the included studies, organoids have various origins, types, and applications in regenerative and precision medicine, as well as an important role in studying extracellular vesicles. Conclusion: Organoids are considered a bridge that connects preclinical studies to clinical ones. However, the lack of a standardized protocol and other barriers addressed in this review, hinder the vast use of this technology. Lay Summary: Organoids are 3D stem cell propagations in biological or synthetic scaffolds that mimic ECM to allow intercellular or matrix-cellular crosstalk. Because these structures are similar to organs in the body, they can be used as research models. Organoids are medicine’s future hope for organ transplantation, tumor biobank formation, and the development of precision medicine. Organoid models can be used to study cell-to-cell interactions as well as effective factors like inflammation and aging. Bioengineering technologies are also used to define the size, shape, and composition of organoids before transforming them into precise structures. Finally, the importance of organoid applications in regenerative medicine has opened a new window for a better understanding of biological research, as discussed in this study. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Regenerative Engineering Society."
"Sentiment classification aims to predict the sentiment label for a given text. Recently, several research efforts have been devoted to incorporate matching clues between text words and class labels into the learning process of text representation. However, these methods heavily rely on the availability of label content. Moreover, they simply capture the label-specific signals to measure each word's contribution by either implicitly employing a learnable label representation or explicitly leveraging the interaction between text words and labels via the interaction mechanism. To deal with these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel framework called Label-Guided Dual-view Sentiment Classifier (LGDSC). We first introduce a new strategy for generating an effective label description and then design a novel Dual-Channel Label-guided Attention Network (DLAN) to learn a text representation via two different channels. DLAN will be further leveraged to learn label-guided text representations from two different views. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that LGDSC consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"The purpose of this research is to synthesize the fragmented extant knowledge on flexible and green supply chain management (FGSCM) in the context of emerging economies and to unearth research gaps to motivate future research. We adopted a novel structured systematic literature review by triangulating a systematic literature review, text mining, and network analysis. Institutional theory and contingency theory were employed to analyze the results of the review. The results show that, firstly, research on FGSCM in emerging economies, despite its importance, is immature compared to general FGSCM literature. Second, the specificities of strategies and practices that distinguish this topic in emerging economies are discussed and the drivers and barriers are identified with respect to sources of institutional pressure. Third, a research framework for FGSCM in emerging economies is developed and 12 gaps for future research are identified. This study has exclusively developed a research framework for FGSCM in an emerging economy which has received the least consideration in the literature and practice. The framework was developed to synthesize the existing literature and to identify the research gaps to inspire future research. © 2022, Crown."
"Central bank independence has raised questions of accountability ever since its global diffusion in the 1990s, and especially since the financial crisis. Yet, whilst the literature on central banks’ legislative oversight has expanded, the role of the media as account holders has been left largely unexplored. We assess media scrutiny by using an original dataset of news articles about the Bank of England published between 1997 and 2020, and by analysing the relationship between central banking outcomes and scrutiny in the form of evaluative and negative coverage of the Bank. We find that the variation in such coverage can be traced back to policy outcomes, but the association is largely confined to the post-crisis period. The findings support a view of the media as instrumental in central bank oversight, but also show the limits of this form of accountability. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"In Shannon theory, semantic aspects of communication were identified but considered irrelevant to the technical communication problems. Semantic communication (SC) techniques have recently attracted renewed research interests in 6 generation (6G) wireless, because they have the capability to support an efficient interpretation of the significance and meaning intended by a sender (or accomplishment of the goal) when dealing with multi-modal data such as videos, images, audio, text messages, and so on, which would be the case for various applications such as intelligent transportation systems where each autonomous vehicle needs to deal with real-Time videos and data from a number of sensors including radars. To this end, most of the emerging SC works focus on specific data types and employ sophisticated machine learning models including deep learning and neural networks. However, they could be impractical for multi-modal data possibly within a real-Time constraint, relative to the purpose of the communication. A notable difficulty of existing SC frameworks lies in handling the discrete constraints imposed on the pursued semantic coding and its interaction with the independent knowledge-base, which makes reliable semantic extraction extremely challenging. Therefore, we develop a new hashing-based semantic extraction approach to SC framework, where our learning objective is to generate one time signatures (hash codes) using supervised learning for low latency, secure and efficient management of the SC dynamics. We first evaluate the proposed semantic extraction framework over large image data sets, extend it with domain adaptive hashing and then demonstrate the effectiveness of 'semantics signature' in bulk transmission and multi-modal data.  © 1967-2012 IEEE."
"Objective: To systematically investigate the efficacy and safety of dextrose prolotherapy for treating chronic plantar fasciitis. Literature survey: EMBASE, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar (from inception to December 9, 2021). Methodology: Comprehensive review of randomized controlled trials investigating dextrose prolotherapy for chronic plantar fasciitis was done. Two investigators independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full texts and extracted data from eligible studies. The changes in visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, foot function index (FFI), American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) score, and plantar fascia thickness were analyzed. Reports of complications of the procedure were collected. Synthesis: Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the meta-analysis, analyzing 444 patients in total. The subgroup analysis showed that at short-term follow-up (<6 months) dextrose prolotherapy was more effective in reducing VAS pain score compared to the non-active treatment control group including exercise and normal saline solution (NSS) injection. However, there was no difference in the change of VAS pain score between dextrose prolotherapy and active treatment control group, which included extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT), steroid injection, and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection. Dextrose prolotherapy was more effective in reducing FFI, increasing AOFAS score, and reducing plantar fascia thickness at short-term (<6 months) follow-up compared to other comparators. For long-term (≥6 months) follow-up, there was no significant difference in the change in VAS pain score and FFI between the dextrose prolotherapy group and other comparators. No serious complication was reported. Conclusions: Dextrose prolotherapy is an effective treatment of chronic plantar fasciitis to reduce pain, improve foot functional score, and decrease plantar fascia thickness at short-term follow-up. Further studies in larger populations are needed to identify the optimal treatment regimen including dextrose concentration, volume, injection site, injection technique, and the number of injections required. The long-term effects of these treatments also require further examination. © 2022 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation."
"Nowadays, cloud computing plays an important role in the process of storing both structured and unstructured data. This contributed to a very large data growth on web servers, which has come to be called Big Data. Cloud computing technology is adopted in many applications, perhaps the most important of which are social networking applications, e-mail messages, and others, which represent an important source of data through the process of communication between web users. Thus, these data represent views and opinions on various topics, which can help businesses and other decision makers in making decisions based on future predictions. To achieve this goal, several methods have been proposed. Recently, it relies on the use of deep learning as a tool for processing large volumes of data due to its high performance in extracting predictions from the opinions of web users. This paper presents a new prediction approach based on Big Data analysis and deep learning for large-scale data, called PABIDDL. The infrastructure of the proposed approach is focused on three important stages, starting with the reduction of Big Data based on MapReduce using the Hadoop framework. In the second stage, we performed the initialization of these data using the GloVe technique. Finally, the text data were classified into advantages and disadvantages poles depending on CNN deep learning approach. Also, we conducted an empirical study of our proposed approach PABIDDL and related works models on two standard datasets IMDB and MR datasets. The results obtained showed that the best performance is given by our approach. We recorded 0.93%, 0.90%, and 0.92% as an accuracy, a recall, and an F1-score, respectively. Furthermore, our approach reached the fastest response time. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
"E-commerce strongly relies on marketing strategies that utilize user given feedback on services provided. Hotels and other hospitabilty outlets such as restaurants enlist user feedback about their services in their online reservation systems, thereby helping thier prospective customers in the decision making process. The credibility of such reviews is of paramount significance and any compromise of the process can lead to unwanted consequences both for customers and businesses. As such, the need for a method by which deceptive reviews are identified is evident to protect community and businesses alike. Deceptive reviews typically exhibit distinctive linguistic clues which can be detected, raising a flag about the credibilty of the user who posted them. Specifically, discursive features that show in such texts can be a useful tool in checking the credibility of reviews. Manually analysing the discourse and different rhetorical structures can be a tedious and timeconsuming process allowing some deceptive reviews to remain publically available. However, coupled with artificial intelligence tools such as deep learning approaches, discourse analysis could be performed in a manner that is both efficient and timely. The proposed study used a balanced publically available deceptive and truthful reviews dataset to design a discourse analysis based credibility check scheme with high accuracy. The multi-context of text is extracted via multi-n-gram windows (named as Discourse markers) applied in a proposed deep multi-channel convolutional neural network (MC-CNN). The hold-out approach is applied with 6 various splits of data on the proposed method MC-CNN to validate the performance. From various experiments, we report the best F1-score 87% has been achieved that not only defended the deep learning based discourse analysis but also defended the hypothesis made on deceptive and truthful reviews by proposed study. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Textline segmentation in ancient handwritten documents is still considered as a challenging task in document analysis and recognition field even though various rule-based methods exist. These methods succeed under constraint such as a roughly uniform background. They do not contribute well in case of variable inter-line spacing and overlapping characters. This article proposes faster region-convolution neural network (R-CNN) based robust method to segment the textlines in the ancient handwritten document in Devanagari script for the first time in literature. The feature matrix has been generated by residual network and proposals have been predicted through the region proposal network (RPN). A pooling layer has been used to extract regions of interest, known as region of interest pooling layer, to locate the textlines. The performance of the proposed textline segmentation system has been evaluated on self generated dataset of ancient handwritten documents in Devanagari script and it has achieved the f-measure of 99.98%. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods of textline segmentation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"The learning rate (LR) is one of the most important hyperparameters in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for training deep neural networks (DNN). However, current hand-designed LR schedules need to manually pre-specify a fixed form, which limits their ability to adapt to practical non-convex optimization problems due to the significant diversification of training dynamics. Meanwhile, it always needs to search proper LR schedules from scratch for new tasks, which, however, are often largely different with task variations, like data modalities, network architectures, or training data capacities. To address this learning-rate-schedule setting issue, we propose to parameterize LR schedules with an explicit mapping formulation, called MLR-SNet. The learnable parameterized structure brings more flexibility for MLR-SNet to learn a proper LR schedule to comply with the training dynamics of DNN. Image and text classification benchmark experiments substantiate the capability of our method for achieving proper LR schedules. Moreover, the explicit parameterized structure makes the meta-learned LR schedules capable of being transferable and plug-and-play, which can be easily generalized to new heterogeneous tasks. We transfer our meta-learned MLR-SNet to query tasks like different training epochs, network architectures, data modalities, dataset sizes from the training ones, and achieve comparable or even better performance compared with hand-designed LR schedules specifically designed for the query tasks. The robustness of MLR-SNet is also substantiated when the training data are biased with corrupted noise. We further prove the convergence of the SGD algorithm equipped with LR schedule produced by our MLR-SNet, with the convergence rate comparable to the best-known ones of the algorithm for solving the problem.

"Keyword extraction is an important topic applicable to a wide range of areas such as span detection, information classification, sentiment analysis, and so on. There are hundreds of algorithms which can extract keywords from text documents. Many of these algorithms also use the functionality of the keywords, which is important, especially if we need to limit to a specific area of knowledge. This research work focuses on extracting keywords from educational texts. In an educational context, the keywords are the most important parts of the lesson and may answer the professor's questions. Classic keyword extraction algorithms have a very low success rate extracting keywords from educational texts, as the words extracted by these algorithms are very different from those selected by the teachers. Normally, the most important words from an educational point of view would not match with the most repeated words in that text. This research work attempts to improve automatic keyword extraction in educative texts, avoiding professors from having to do this tedious task. The possibility of detecting keywords automatically could be a starting point for the creation of applications capable of generating questions and exercises automatically. We tested whether the most popular word extraction algorithms were able to extract the keywords selected by professors efficiently. The result obtained by current algorithms were no good at all, as they showed a low true positive rate or very high rates of false positive. Due to these reasons, we designed a novel algorithm based on linguistic approaches and evolutive graphs. The research method to obtain the new algorithm was the design of a complex graph which operates with numerous characteristics related to the relationships between words and their linguistic properties. The graph was trained with a set of texts and keywords to establish the optimal weights for each of the characteristics. The proposal achieves a rate of true positives (TP) and F1 score significantly better than other algorithms. © 2022"

"Context: Several tertiary studies have criticized the reporting of software engineering secondary studies. Objective: Our objective is to identify guidelines for reporting software engineering (SE) secondary studies which would address problems observed in the reporting of software engineering systematic reviews (SRs). Method: We review the criticisms of SE secondary studies and identify the major areas of concern. We assess the PRISMA 2020 (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement as a possible solution to the need for SR reporting guidelines, based on its status as the reporting guideline recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration whose SR guidelines were a major input to the guidelines developed for SE. We report its advantages and limitations in the context of SE secondary studies. We also assess reporting guidelines for mapping studies and qualitative reviews, and compare their structure and content with that of PRISMA 2020. Results: Previous tertiary studies confirm that reports of secondary studies are of variable quality. However, ad hoc recommendations that amend reporting standards may result in unnecessary duplication of text. We confirm that the PRISMA 2020 statement addresses SE reporting problems, but is mainly oriented to quantitative reviews, mixed-methods reviews and meta-analyses. However, we show that the PRISMA 2020 item definitions can be extended to cover the information needed to report mapping studies and qualitative reviews. Conclusions: In this paper and its Supplementary Material, we present and illustrate an integrated set of guidelines called SEGRESS (Software Engineering Guidelines for REporting Secondary Studies), suitable for quantitative systematic reviews (building upon PRISMA 2020), mapping studies (PRISMA-ScR), and qualitative reviews (ENTREQ and RAMESES), that addresses reporting problems found in current SE SRs.  © 2022 IEEE."
"Existing image aesthetics assessment methods mainly rely on the visual features of images but ignore their rich semantics. Nowadays, with the widespread application of social media, the comments corresponding to images in the form of texts can be easily accessed and provide rich semantic information, which can be utilized to effectively complement image features. This paper proposes a comment-guided semantics-aware image aesthetics assessment method, which is built upon a multi-task learning framework for image aesthetics prediction and comment-guided semantics classification. To assist image aesthetics assessment, we first model the semantics of an image as the topic features of its corresponding comments using Latent Dirichlet Allocation. We then propose a two-stream multitask learning framework for both topic feature prediction and aesthetic score distribution prediction. Topic feature prediction task enables to infer the semantics from images, since the comments are usually unavailable during inference and comment-guided semantics can only serve as supervision during training. We further propose to deeply fuse aesthetics and semantic features using a layerwise feature fusion method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image aesthetics assessment methods.  © 1991-2012 IEEE."
"Nutrient deficiency during growth is a major cause of reduced yield for wide variety of plants. Yield can be improved if nutrient levels are regularly checked, and maintained using proper fertilization & pest control. In order to perform this task, a wide variety of image processing systems models have been developed, which aim at analysing plant imagery to look for visually apparent nutrient deficient patterns. But these systems are able to identify nutrient deficiencies after the plant is affected by them. In contrast to this, intrusive systems are developed which perform chemical analysis on leaf samples in order to estimate these deficiencies. Performing such chemical analysis limits their testing capabilities because random leaf samples are taken for evaluation, thereby limiting their accuracy. In order to remove these drawbacks, this text proposes a nonintrusive multifrequency visible light analysis framework, that can be used for identification of multiple nutrient deficiencies for a wide variety of plants. In order to map spatial & temporal light properties with nutrient shortages with high accuracy, this framework leverages extensive learning. In order to authenticate the readings, the framework also processes nonintrusive microscopic photos of the same plant leaf using a deep learning technique. This is accomplished by an incremental learning technique that combines the high-efficiency classification capabilities of the VGGNet19 and XceptionNet models. The model can be used for proactive nutrient monitoring and to conduct corrective actions to improve yield quality because it is nonintrusive. The proposed model was evaluated for potassium, nitrogen, copper, zinc, and phosphorus deficit in orange, cotton, apple, banana, mango, litchi, henna, gooseberry, and okra leaf. It was observed that the proposed approach is able to achieve 99.7% accuracy for detection of potassium, 97.2% for nitrogen, 98.5% for copper, 96.8% for zinc, and 95.9% for detection of phosphorus. This accuracy was evaluated by finding average performance of the model for different leaf types, and was compared with various state-of-the-art models. It was observed that the proposed approach has 8% better accuracy than previously described models, and showcases better precision, recall, and fMeasure performance. Due to intensive learning, the model requires large initial delay of training, but evaluation speed is at par with recent state-of-the-art models. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers."
"Background: Men with Klinefelter Syndrome develop some degree of seminiferous tubule degeneration, hyalinization, and fibrosis by adulthood. However, the pathophysiology surrounding testicular fibrosis in Klinefelter Syndrome patients remains incompletely understood. Objectives: To perform a systematic review of literature studying the mechanisms of fibrosis initiation or propagation in Klinefelter Syndrome testes. Materials/methods: PubMed was searched systematically for articles specific to Klinefelter Syndrome and the process of fibrosis. Articles that did not contain original data or specifically addressed the target material were excluded. Additional references were extracted when pertinent from the reference lists of included studies. Results: Primary search yielded 139 articles for abstract review, which was narrowed to 16 for full-text review. Following full-text review, eight contained original data and met topic criteria, with one paper added from reference review for a total of nine papers. Discussion: The date range for included papers was 1992–2022. The proposed mechanisms of fibrosis mainly were centered around the impact of altered Sertoli cells on germ cells, the hormonal impact on Leydig cells, the inflammation mediated by mast cells, or the fibrous extracellular matrix deposition by peritubular myoid cells. Additionally, discussions of the role of the altered microvasculature and the specific proteins involved in the blood-testis barrier or the seminiferous tubule architecture are reviewed. Recent papers have incorporated advanced sequencing and offer future directions for targeted gene expression analysis. Still, much of the published data consists solely of immunohistological assessment by age range, creating difficulties in extrapolating causality. Conclusion: The specific initiating factors of fibrosis of the seminiferous tubules and the propagation mechanisms unique to Klinefelter Syndrome remain incompletely understood with a relative paucity of data. Nonetheless, academic interest is increasing in this field as it may further elucidate the pathophysiology behind Klinefelter syndrome. © 2022 The Authors.

"Study objective: Patients undergoing diagnostic imaging studies in the emergency department (ED) commonly have incidental findings, which may represent unrecognized serious medical conditions, including cancer. Recognition of incidental findings frequently relies on manual review of textual radiology reports and can be overlooked in a busy clinical environment. Our study aimed to develop and validate a supervised machine learning model using natural language processing to automate the recognition of incidental findings in radiology reports of patients discharged from the ED. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of computed tomography (CT) reports from trauma patients discharged home across an integrated health system in 2019. Two independent annotators manually labeled CT reports for the presence of an incidental finding as a reference standard. We used regular expressions to derive and validate a random forest model using open-source and machine learning software. Final model performance was assessed across different ED types. Results: The study CT reports were divided into derivation (690 reports) and validation (282 reports) sets, with a prevalence of incidental findings of 22.3%, and 22.7%, respectively. The random forest model had an area under the curve of 0.88 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84 to 0.92) on the derivation set and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88 to 0.96) on the validation set. The final model was found to have a sensitivity of 92.2%, a specificity of 79.4%, and a negative predictive value of 97.2%. Similarly, strong model performance was found when stratified to a dedicated trauma center, high-volume, and low-volume community EDs. Conclusion: Machine learning and natural language processing can classify incidental findings in CT reports of ED patients with high sensitivity and high negative predictive value across a broad range of ED settings. These findings suggest the utility of natural language processing in automating the review of free-text reports to identify incidental findings and may facilitate interventions to improve timely follow-up. © 2022 American College of Emergency Physicians"
"This paper aims to investigate the impact of different parameters on promoting the role of cycling as a daily mode of transport. In the first step of the analyses, binary logistic regression was used to examine the impact of different parameters on using or not using the bicycle as a transportation mode in weekly trips. Then by text mining, the main reasons for not using a bicycle in weekly trips are outlined. Finally, for those who use bicycles for at least one utilitarian trip a week, the effect of different factors on the popularity of this mode is investigated by structural equation modeling. Tehran, as a big city in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, was considered as the case study. The results suggest that it is necessary to work on social norms about cycling, especially among those with higher education levels and income. Women use bicycles less than men and it is also necessary to rethink attitudes and regulations in relation to women cycling in Islamic countries. Bicycle promotion should aim to facilitate more positive attitudes among women. Providing more facilities such as safe bicycle paths, bicycle parking, and bike-sharing facilities have significant impacts on using this mode and its popularity. In highly congested cities, alongside facilitating cycling, it is important to set restrictions on private car use. © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers."
"Video-text retrieval is a crucial task that has been a powerful application for multi-media data analysis and attracted tremendous interest in the research area. The core steps are feature representations and alignment to overcome the heterogeneous gap between videos and texts. Existing methods not only take advantage of multi-modal information in videos but also explore local alignment to enhance retrieval accuracy. Although performing well, these methods seem deficient at three perspectives: a) The semantic correlations between different modal features are not considered, which introduces irrelevant noise in feature representations. b) The cross-modal relations and temporal associations are ambiguously learned by a single self-attention manipulation. c) The training signal to optimize the semantic topic assignment for local alignment is missing. In this paper, we proposed a novel Temporal Multi-modal Graph Transformer with Global-Local Alignment (TMMGT-GLA) for video-text retrieval. We model the input video as a sequence of semantic correlation graphs to exploit the structural information between multi-modal features. Graph and temporal self-attention layers are leveraged on the semantic correlation graphs to effectively learn cross-modal relations and temporal associations respectively. For local alignment, the encoded video and text features are assigned to a set of shared semantic topics, and the distances between residuals from the same ones are minimized. To optimize the assignments, a minimum entropy-based regularization term is proposed for training the overall framework. Experimental results are carried out on the MSR-VTT, LSMDC, and ActivityNet Captions datasets. Our method outperforms previous approaches by a large margin and achieves state-of-the-art performance.  © 1991-2012 IEEE."
"Young adults (ages 18 to 25) in the U.S. suffer from the highest rates of past-year major depressive episode and are the least likely to receive treatment compared to other age groups. As such, we examined the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a text-message delivered cognitive behavioral therapy: CBT-txt with young adults. The study was a 2-month pilot RCT to test a 4-week intervention for depression that contained 197 text messages (average 12 texts every other day). The sample, recruited via Facebook and Instagram, was 102 U.S. young adults who presented with at least moderate depressive symptomatology. Assessments occurred at baseline prior to randomization and at 1 and 2 months post enrollment. The primary outcome, severity of depressive symptoms, was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory II. Feasibility benchmarks were met and participants reported high levels of engagement with and acceptability of the intervention. Logistic regression indicated that treatment participants were three times as likely to have minimal or mild depression symptoms at 2 months compared to waitlist control participants. Latent change score modeling found that the strongest significant treatment effect appeared at the 1-month follow-up period, particularly for participants who began with severe depressive symptoms. Mediation analysis revealed significant indirect treatment effects of increases in behavioral activation on reducing depressive symptoms, suggesting a mechanism of change. Limitations were that the sample was relatively small and consisted of primarily women. These results provide initial evidence for the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a text-delivered treatment for young adult depression. © 2023"
"Internet applications such as Online Social Networking and Electronic commerce are becoming incredibly common, resulting in more content being available. Recommender systems (RS) assist users in identifying appropriate information out of a large pool of options. In today’s internet applications, RS are extremely important. To increase user satisfaction, this type of system supports personalized recommendations based on a massive volume of data. These suggestions assist clients in selecting products, while concerns can increase product utilization. We discovered that much research work is going on in the field of recommendation and that there are some effective systems out there. In the context of social information, sentimental analysis (SA) can aid in increasing the knowledge of a user’s behaviour, views, and reactions, which is helpful for incorporating into RS to improve recommendation accuracy. RS has been found to resolve information overload challenges in information retrieval, but they still have issues with cold-start and data sparsity. SA, on the other hand, is well-known for interpreting text and conveying user choices. It’s frequently used to assist E-Commerce in tracking customer feedback on their products and attempting to comprehend customer needs and preferences. To improve the accuracy and correctness of any RS, this paper proposes a recommendation model based on a Hybrid Recommendation Model (HRM) and hybrid SA. In the proposed method, we first generate a preliminary recommendation list using a HRM. To generate the final recommendation list, the HRM with SA is used. In terms of various evaluation criteria, the HRM with SA outperforms traditional models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"The registration statement, the inquiry letter, and the reply letter are the main application materials for companies wanting to list on the Science and Technology Innovation Board (STAR) need to submit to regulatory agencies In this paper, we aim to study the impact of these three kinds of application materials on the successful listing of companies on STAR market in China through six text characteristics, including Words, Boilerplate, Fog Index, HardInfoMix, Redundancy, and Specificity for the first time. In the empirical analysis, we collect the registration statements and the inquiry-reply letters of 220 listed companies and 64 unlisted companies from June 13, 2019 to January 31, 2021 to perform the regression analysis. The empirical results show that, for registration statements, higher Words and Boilerplate will improve the success rate for listing, but higher Redundancy will lead to the failed listing. For the inquiry-reply letter, only the number of questions contained in the inquiry letter is negatively significantly associated with the initial public offering (IPO) success rate, while the text characteristics of the reply letter have little to do with the IPO success rate. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"The aim of this paper is to develop a model to classify the stance expressed in social media texts. More specifically, the work presented focuses on tweets. In stance detection (SD) tasks, the objective is to identify the stance of a person towards a target of interest. In this paper, a model for SD is established and its variations are evaluated using different classifiers. The single models differ based on the pre-processing and the combination of features. To reduce the dimensionality of the feature space, analysis of variance (ANOVA) test is used. Then, two classifiers are employed as base learners including Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Experimental analyses are conducted on SemEval dataset that is used as a benchmark for SD. Finally, the base learners that resulted from different design alternatives, are combined into three ensemble models. Experimental results show the significance of the used features and the effectiveness of a manually built dictionary that is used in the pre-processing stage. Moreover, the proposed ensembles outperform the state-of-the-art models in the overall test score, which suggests that ensemble learning is the best tool for effective SD in tweets.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company."
"Science, Technology, and Innovation (STI) have been considered as critical tools in development processes, gaining growing importance in the public policy agenda. We assert that an intersubjective agreement about STI policy has emerged in Latin America from the beginning of the twenty-first century. This operates as a developmental convention which is based on a hybrid theoretical rationale from neoclassical economics and the innovation systems approach. This process has been analyzed from different perspectives of innovation and political economy studies. However, as far as we know, the role of political parties in the construction and reproduction of STI conventions has not been studied. After illustrating the general assertion with stylized facts from the whole Latin American region, we study the platforms that Uruguayan political parties presented in the national elections between 2004 and 2019. Text analysis techniques show that platforms of both left- and right-wing political parties were embedded in the current STI policy convention. However, critical discrepancies emerge in relation to policy implementation—the positive and negative agendas—which show that there has been political competition regarding the role of the state and of markets. This leads us to conclude that even though one can observe a shared set of building blocks on STI policy and development, there is competition within the current convention, suggesting that any agreement is illusory. © 2022 Policy Studies Organization."
"This article describes the research design and findings from a use-inspired study of online text-based mathematics resources. We sought to understand whether and how existing mathematics interest, together with the learner characteristics of prior coursework in mathematics and proof scheme, influenced comprehension of mathematical argumentation and triggered interest in two types of mathematics text: (1) text featuring concrete, real-world applications (public domain) and (2) text with abstract and generalized modes of expression and content (abstract domain). Using an online assessment and person-centered analyses, we studied 64 (32 M, 32 F) undergraduate students who were and were not pursuing advanced mathematics coursework. Cluster analysis revealed two participant groups. Less mathematically immersed (LMI) participants improved comprehension of mathematical argumentation when working with public domain text, performing comparably to the more mathematically immersed (MMI) cluster in this domain; those in the MMI cluster performed comparably across text domains. In addition, LMI participants were more likely to identify public domain text as more interesting than abstract text, and they also were more likely than those in the MMI group to explain this by citing public rather than abstract domain reasons. Taken together, study findings suggest that interest in coordination with other learner characteristics scaffolds comprehension of mathematical argumentation. This study makes contributions to interest theory, understanding the role of interest in comprehension of mathematical argumentation, and ways in which practitioners might leverage student interest to promote comprehension. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"The analytic connectivity (AC), defined via solving a series of constrained polynomial optimization problems, serves as a measure of connectivity in hypergraphs. How to compute such a quantity efficiently is important in practice and of theoretical challenge as well due to the non-convex and combinatorial features in its definition. In this article, we first perform a careful analysis of several widely used structured hypergraphs in terms of their properties and heuristic upper bounds of ACs. We then present an affine-scaling method to compute some upper bounds of ACs for uniform hypergraphs. To testify the tightness of the obtained upper bounds, two possible approaches via the Pólya theorem and semidefinite programming respectively are also proposed to verify the lower bounds generated by the obtained upper bounds minus a small gap. Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets are reported to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed method. Further, we apply our method in hypergraphs constructed from social networks and text analysis to detect the network connectivity and rank the keywords, respectively. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"We aimed to evaluate the performance of supervised machine learning algorithms in predicting articles relevant for full-text review in a systematic review. Overall, 16,430 manually screened titles/abstracts, including 861 references identified relevant for full-text review were used for the analysis. Of these, 40% (n = 6573) were sub-divided for training (70%) and testing (30%) the algorithms. The remaining 60% (n = 9857) were used as a validation set. We evaluated down- and up-sampling methods and compared unigram, bigram, and singular value decomposition (SVD) approaches. For each approach, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), regularized logistic regressions, neural networks, random forest, Logit boost, and XGBoost were implemented using simple term frequency or Tf-Idf feature representations. Performance was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, precision and area under the Curve. We combined predictions of the best-performing algorithms (Youden Index ≥0.3 with sensitivity/specificity≥70/60%). In a down-sample unigram approach, Naïve Bayes, SVM/quanteda text models with Tf-Idf, and linear SVM e1071 package with Tf-Idf achieved >90% sensitivity at specificity >65%. Combining the predictions of the 10 best-performing algorithms improved the performance to reach 95% sensitivity and 64% specificity in the validation set. Crude screening burden was reduced by 61% (5979) (adjusted: 80.3%) with 5% (27) false negativity rate. All the other approaches yielded relatively poorer performances. The down-sampling unigram approach achieved good performance in our data. Combining the predictions of algorithms improved sensitivity while screening burden was reduced by almost two-third. Implementing machine learning approaches in title/abstract screening should be investigated further toward refining these tools and automating their implementation. © 2022 The Authors.

"Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) is an important target of science teacher knowledge assessment. Most studies that have assessed the PCK across a large sample of science teachers used a text-based approach to elicit and assess the more declarative and static form of teachers' PCK. Recently, small-scale qualitative studies have adopted a novel video-based approach to characterize the more situated and dynamic form of PCK underpinning a teacher's in-the-moment pedagogical reasoning. In this relatively large-scale mixed-methods study, these two approaches to assessing PCK were compared. Specifically, a counterbalanced design was adopted to compare the test scores of 147 Grade 7 biology teachers in a video-based PCK test with those of the same teachers in a text-based PCK test with the same content. A subgroup of teachers (N = 30) with different levels of PCK was interviewed to further understand their reactions to the test and how these might have affected their test performance. The results of paired-samples t tests showed that the teachers' PCK scores in the two types of test were significantly correlated, but their scores were significantly lower in the video-based test. In terms of teacher reactions, although the teachers considered both types of test to be fair, they regarded the video-based test as more authentic and more closely related to their job demands. The teachers reported putting more effort into the video-based test and feeling more immersed and engaged, but also experiencing greater cognitive demand and a higher level of anxiety. A multiple regression analysis revealed that the cognitive demand perceived by the teachers significantly predicted their PCK scores in the video-based test. The findings have implications for the valid design of video-based PCK tests. © 2022 National Association for Research in Science Teaching."
"Recent advances in interactive recommender systems (IRS) have received wide attention due to its flexible recommendation strategy and optimization for users’ long-term utility. Considering this interaction paradigm of IRS, researchers have made some attempts to incorporate reinforcement learning (RL) models into IRS, because of the excellent ability of RL in long-term optimizing and decision making. However, data sparsity is an intractable problem most IRS urgently need to address. Although a small amount of work has exploited reviews to address data sparsity, they ignored the varying importance of items for modeling the user. In addition, most existing RL-based approaches suffer from decision-making difficulties when the action space becomes large. To solve above problems, in this work, we present a Review-enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning model (REDRL) for interactive recommendation. Specifically, we utilize text reviews, combined with a pretrained review representation model to acquire item review-enhanced embedding representations. Then we formalize the recommendation problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and exploit deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to model the interactive recommendation. Notably, we introduce a multi-head self-attention technique to capture distinct importance of various items in the sequence behavior, which is overlooked by existing work when modeling the user preference. In this way, we can model long-term dynamic preferences of users accurately and discriminately for comprehensive interactive recommendation. Moreover, we subtly combine the semantic structure information in the user–item bipartite graph with meta-paths in heterogeneous information networks (HIN), to filter some irrelevant items and obtain candidate items dynamically. By this means, the size of the discrete action space is effectively reduced from a new anger. The experimental results based on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our method with significant improvement over state-of-the-art. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Background: Stroke compromises the quality of life and wellbeing of stroke survivors and families as a whole. The unexpected caregiving responsibilities often cause psychological distress, overwhelming emotions, living losses and grief, and relational conflicts with stroke survivors. Despite the increasing research to better understand their needs, empirically sound and holistic psychosocial interventions for stroke caregivers are lacking. Aims: This study aims to consolidate psycho-socio-emotional needs and challenges in the existing systematic reviews and offer potential directions for psychosocial interventions to better support caregivers at a psycho-socio-emotional level. Methods: This systematic review adhered to the PRISMA guideline and employed the PICo (population, phenomena of interest, context) framework to screen for relevant systematic reviews for analysis. Six major databases were searched, including Academic Search Premier, CINAHL, Global Health, Medline, PsycArticles, and PsycInfo between 2010 and 2020. Ten systematic reviews were selected for full-text analysis using thematic synthesis. Summary of review: Data synthesis revealed eight themes with sixteen sub-themes, all together organized into two main theme categories. The psycho-socio-emotional challenges included disruptions to (1) psychological homeostasis, (2) role equilibrium, (3) familial connection, and (4) caregiving empowerment. The psycho-socio-emotional coping mechanisms, which could be adopted to buffer against the identified challenges, involved (1) recalibration of normality and balance, (2) psychosocial support and caregiver relief, (3) relational reorientation and dyadic coping, and (4) institutional holistic care and support. Conclusion: The findings accentuate the importance of addressing living losses and grief emerging from the caregiving journey, as well as facilitating meaning reconstruction to safeguard caregivers’ wellbeing. Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed. © 2022 World Stroke Organization."
"Deep neural networks have achieved good performance in recent years for aspect-level sentiment classification (ASC), whereas most neural ASC models neglect the commonsense knowledge absent from text but essential for aspect affective understanding, which largely limits the performance of neural ASC. In this paper, we propose a Weakly Supervised Knowledge Attentive Network, which resolves the above problems via knowledge attention and weakly supervised learning. Specifically, we first present a Knowledge Attentive Network (KAN) to capture more aspect-related information by incorporating external commonsense knowledge into the attention mechanism. Then, we propose a weakly supervised learning method, which allows our KAN model to learn more knowledge from the pseudo-samples generated upon the rich-resource document-level sentiment classification datasets. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show the significant advantages of our proposed approach. In particular, we obtain state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy on all the datasets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a granular-level sentiment analysis task that aims to detect the sentiment polarities of a specified aspect in the text. This research shows excessive curiosity in modelling target and context through attention networks to attain effective feature representations for sentiment detection works. We have proposed a synthetic attention in bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (SA-BERT) with an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) classifier to classify sentiment polarity in the review dataset. The proposed model generates dynamic word vector encoding of the aspect and corresponding context of the reviews. Then, the aspect and context of the reviews are meaningfully represented by a transformer that can input the vector word in parallel. After that, the model uses the synthetic attention mechanism to learn essential parts of context and aspects in reviews. Finally, the model places overall representation in the sentiment classification layer to predict sentiment polarity. Both proposed SA-BERT and SA-BERT-XGBoost models achieved the highest accuracy (92.02 and 93.71%) on the restaurant16 and highest F-1 scores (81.19 and 81.64%) on the restaurant14 dataset, respectively. The average accuracy and F1 scores are approximately 2 and 3.04% higher than the baseline models (DLCF-DCA-CDM, R-GAT+BERT, ASGCN-DG, AEN-BERT and BERT-PT). Therefore, proposed models outperform in comparison with baseline models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"In this brief, a 2-10 GHz reconfigurable power amplifier (PA) with power-added efficiency (PAE) of 30% and output power of 2W is proposed using commercial $0.25~\mathbf {\mu }\text{m}$ GaN technology. It consists of two-stage amplifier transistors with reconfigurable input, inter-stage and output matching networks. By utilizing the reconfigurable matching networks, the proposed PA circuit divides the frequency band of 2-10 GHz into three continuous sub-frequency bands, and achieves high power added efficiency and gain in each sub-frequency band. As a result, the proposed PA can simultaneously maintain high efficiency and high gain and cover multioctave bandwidth. Moreover, in order to further improve the efficiency, harmonic suppression is used in low-band with open circuit impedance at third harmonic. With these techniques, the proposed PA covers frequency band of 2-10 GHz, delivers an average PAE of 38% at 2-5 GHz, 31% at 5-7 GHz, and 31.5% at 7-10 GHz. Good agreement between simulation and measurement is obtained.  © 2004-2012 IEEE."
"Background The US Food and Drug Administration requires six text-only warnings for cigar products, including cigarillos. Research has demonstrated the superiority of pictorial over text-only cigarette warnings, yet the relative effectiveness of pictorial warnings for cigarillos has not been examined. We examined the impact of pictorial cigarillo warnings compared with text-only warnings. Methods Data were collected from a nationally representative sample of US young adult (18-29) cigarillo users and susceptible non-users. Participants were randomised to one of three experimental conditions: text-only or one of two pictorial conditions (combined for analyses). For each warning, we assessed negative emotional reactions, cognitive elaboration (ie, thinking about cigarillo risks) and perceived message effectiveness (PME). Results Participants (N=661) were 46.5% female, 64.7% white and 21.9% Hispanic; 34.1% reported past 30-day cigarillo use; 41.4% were lifetime users (excluding past 30-day use); and 24.4% were susceptible non-users. Pictorial warnings elicited more negative emotional reactions and higher PME than text-only warnings (p values<0.01), with interactions showing the largest effects for past 30-day users (emotional reactions: d=0.99, PME: d=0.63). For cognitive elaboration, there was no main effect of warning type, but an interaction revealed effects for past 30-day users (p<0.05, d=0.46). Conclusions Pictorial cigarillo warnings elicited greater negative emotional reactions and PME compared with text-only warnings. These effects and the effects on cognitive elaboration were strongest for past 30-day users. Our findings extend research on cigarette warnings to cigarillos, demonstrating that pictorial warnings are superior to text-only warnings for cigarillos in eliciting beneficial responses.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"Amongst the most treated questions in Western research on the works of Svetlana Aleksievich is the question of the genre of Aleksievich’s prose works, followed closely by the question of the historical authenticity of her method of collecting oral information about the Soviet period of history from witnesses of that history. The questions treated, such as the problem of genre, aesthetic authenticity and the relationship of history and fiction, can be distilled into the question of the authority of the literary text. If the Nobel Prize for literature is awarded on the assumption that Aleksievich’s work is literature—and no one, including the author, has questioned that assumption—then it is justifiable to pose the question of the authority of the literary text as an aesthetic message—as literary truth—using the tools of literary analysis, not of historiography or sociology. In this essay, the claim that Secondhand Time [Vremia second hend] is a novel will be examined in the context of the narratological model of the literary text of Russian Formalism and Prague Structuralism and by applying the test of “artistic quality” (khudozhestvennost’), which validates the aesthetic value of texts of the literary canon. This examination will allow us to answer the question about what kind of text has been created using oral testimonies as material for a work of fiction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Discourse structure annotation aims at analysing how discourse units (e.g. sentences or clauses) relate to each other and what roles they play in the overall discourse. Several annotation tools for discourse structure have been developed. However, they often only support specific annotation schemes, making their usage limited to new schemes. This article presents TIARA 2.0, an annotation tool for discourse structure and text improvement. Departing from our specific needs, we extend an existing tool to accommodate four levels of annotation: discourse structure, argumentative structure, sentence rearrangement and content alteration. The latter two are particularly unique compared to existing tools. TIARA is implemented on standard web technologies and can be easily customised. It deals with the visual complexity during the annotation process by systematically simplifying the layout and by offering interactive visualisation, including clutter-reducing features and dual-view display. TIARA’s text-view allows annotators to focus on the analysis of logical sequencing between sentences. The tree-view allows them to review their analysis in terms of the overall discourse structure. Apart from being an annotation tool, it is also designed to be useful for educational purposes in the teaching of argumentation; this gives it an edge over other existing tools. © 2021, The Author(s)."
"Commercially sold electrical or gas products must comply with the safety standards imposed within a country and get registered and certified by a regulated body. However, with the increasing transition of businesses to e-commerce platforms, it becomes challenging to govern the compliance status of online products. This can increase the risk of purchasing non-compliant products which may be unsafe to use. Additionally, examining the compliance status before purchasing can be strenuous because the relevant compliance information can be ambiguous and not always directly available. Therefore, we collaborated with a regulated body from Australia, Energy Safe Victoria, and conducted compliance analyses for household appliances sold on multiple online platforms. A fully autonomous method shown in this public repository is also introduced to check the compliance status of any online product. In this talk, we discuss the compliance check process, which incorporates fuzzy logic for textual matching and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify the product listing based on the images listed. Subsequently, we studied the results with the business users and found that many online listings are non-compliant, signifying that online-shopping consumers are highly susceptible to buying unsafe products.

"The narrative approach has developed in various directions—philosophy, qualitative analysis, therapy, pedagogy, and research methodology—but these various directions are often isolated from each other. This article weaves together these five threads of narrative in order to suggest a novel way for how narrative can be used in the classroom. This is done through narratively expressed action research (Jean Clandinin) on the experiences of the author, a university teacher in Japan, and his attempts to incorporate narrative elements into career education classes. This article begins with its theoretical foundations, the narrative philosophy of education of Mori Akira, and how it was applied to pedagogically support the growth of self-awareness S1 (social identity) in a university orientation class. It then explores the design principles of this class, drawing from Dan P. McAdams’s narrative analysis and modified using narrative therapy (Michael White & David Epston). Next, it narrates the teacher’s experience of reading and responding to students’ narratives in two parts: the first five sessions where students write autobiographical exercises (looking at the “authored self”) and the last two sessions where students reflect on the texts they have written (highlighting the “authoring self”). I conclude with several design principles that seek to weave together narrative pedagogy, analysis, and therapy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature."
"Purpose: Nowadays, the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused an important change in teaching models. The emotional experience of this change has an important impact on online teaching. This paper aims to explore its time evolution characteristics and provide reference for the development of online teaching in the post epidemic era. Design/methodology/approach: The article firstly crawls the online teaching-related comment text data on Zhihu platform and performs emotional calculation to obtain a one-dimensional time series of daily average emotional values. Then, by using non-linear time-series analysis, this paper reconstructs the daily average emotion value time series in high-dimensional phase space, calculates the maximum Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimension and finally, explores the feature patterns through recurrence plot and recurrence quantification analysis. Findings: It was found that the sequence has typical non-linear chaotic characteristics; its correlation dimension indicates that it contains obvious fractal characteristics; the public emotional evolution shows a cyclical rise and fall. By text mining and temporal evolution analysis, this paper explores the evolution law over chronically of the daily average emotion value time series, provides feasible strategies to improve students' online learning experience and quality and continuously optimizes this new teaching model in the era of pandemic. Originality/value: Based on social knowledge sharing platform of Q&A, this paper models and analyzes users interaction data under online teaching-related topics. This paper explores the evolution law over a long time period of the daily average emotion value time series using text mining and temporal evolution analysis. It then offers workable solutions to enhance the quality and experience of students' online learning, and it continuously improves this new teaching model in the age of pandemics. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Video captioning aims at automatically generating a natural language caption to describe the content of a video. However, most of the existing methods in the video captioning task ignore the relationship between objects in the video and the correlation between multimodal features, and they also ignore the effect of caption length on the task. This study proposes a novel video captioning framework (ORMF) based on the object relation graph and multimodal feature fusion. ORMF uses the similarity and Spatio-temporal relationship of objects in video to construct object relation features graph and introduce graph convolution network (GCN) to encode the object relation. At the same time, ORMF also constructs a multimodal features fusion network to learn the relationship between different modal features. The multimodal feature fusion network is used to fuse the features of different modals. Furthermore, the proposed model calculates the length loss of the caption, making the caption get richer information. The experimental results on two public datasets (Microsoft video captioning corpus [MSVD] and Microsoft research-video to text [MSR-VTT]) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. © 2022 The Authors.

"Fatal Fetal Anomaly (FFA) has generated international media attention as termination of pregnancy (TOP) for FFA was legislated for, for the first time in Ireland. Media offers an insight into what health-related information is available to the public and how it is presented to them. The aim of this study was to examine how information related to FFA, TOP for FFA and perinatal palliative care (PPC) were framed in Irish published media. A critical discourse analysis, which examines the relations between discourse and social and cultural phenomena was implemented. Habermasian’s framework facilitated an objective analysis of the text, to facilitate interpretation and understanding of socially produced meanings. A broadsheet and journal were chosen. Dated from 2012 to 2017, 129 articles were identified. Themes of personification of the unborn, human rights and power and politics were embedded in the discourse, creating political influence to sway perceptions and views. Terminology were chosen by different ideological perspectives to create varying contexts and support arguments. PPC was suppressed within the published media. This study highlights misrepresentations in the information delivered to the public and suggests the need for healthcare professionals to expand their media literacy and develop these skills with their patients. © The Author(s) 2021."
"Objectives: To explore the characteristics of functional dysphonia (FD) using multimodal methods. Methods: A total of 47 FD patients and a group of 22 normal controls were enrolled. Subjective auditory-perceptual assessment of the voice, Voice Handicap Index (VHI) 30, acoustic analysis, psychological scales assessment, surface electromyography (sEMG), nasal airflow and thoracoabdominal studies were performed. Results: FD was mostly triggered by mood changes. Patient self-evaluation was more serious than auditory-perceptual evaluation and objective acoustic analysis. There was no obvious organic disorder observed under laryngoscope in patients with FD, but there were cases of glottic insufficiency and supraglottic compensation. With regards to sEMG, nasal airflow, chest, and abdomen examination results: (1) sEMG in the normal control group was symmetrical and stable on both sides during rest and phonation, and nasal airflow as well as the chest and abdomen were symmetrical and regular; (2) sEMG in the FD group showed increased recruitment of the sternocleidomastoid muscles, the infra- and suprahyoid muscles, and the cricothyroid muscle, accompanied by prephonation recruitment and postphonation persistence, mainly involving the infra- and suprahyoid muscles; (3) In the FD group, there was shortened inspiratory time, increased chest breathing amplitude, and reduced abdominal breathing, with predominantly chest breathing, and a “breath-holding” phenomenon was observed in some patients, with a significant increase in the number of breaths during the short text task. Conclusions: FD occurs mainly in middle-aged women, and there are many triggers. The Hamilton Anxiety/Depression Rating Scale scores were higher, and subjective symptoms were more serious than objective evaluation. No obvious organic changes were seen under laryngoscope, and features such as supraglottic compensation and glottic insufficiency were observed; muscle tension was significantly higher than that of the normal control group, and prephonation recruitment and postphonatory persistence were seen in some patients; the breathing pattern was mainly chest breathing, and the times of breaths during the short text task significantly increased. With identification of the characteristics of FD, the therapy could be focused them. © 2020 The Voice Foundation"
"Western European politics has experienced considerable change since the 1980s, with the emergence of new parties and immigration’s politicisation. However, no studies have examined Green party discussions of immigration, or their interaction with radical right parties. We hypothesise that increases in the radical right’s vote share, and the saliency they attach to immigration, will incentivise Greens to discuss immigration more. We also examine an alternative explanation that how salient immigration is for left- and right-wing parties will affect immigration’s saliency for Greens. We test this by applying structural topic models to parliamentary speeches in the Dutch Tweede Kamer for 2002–2019. We find that Greens react to the radical right, as the latter’s vote share is positively associated with immigration’s saliency for Greens, although radical right immigration saliency’s effect is not robust. Furthermore, we do not find evidence that Greens react to immigration’s saliency in left- or right-wing party speeches. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Consumers tend to attribute human-like traits to a country. Applying theories of country personality and integrated marketing communications, this study examines country personalities as reflected in the website content of government agencies across functions. Specifically, this study used LIWC-based textual analysis to explore the Big Five personality dimensions in the text of government websites. Four ministries of China and South Korea's government with public diplomacy responsibilities were identified: ministries of agriculture, education, tourism & culture, and foreign affairs. Text data on 24 government websites were collected for this study in 2018. Our findings show that countries are different in presenting personalities via the website content of government branches. South Korean government focuses on the branches of foreign affairs and tourism & culture in presenting personalities of agreeableness, extraversion, and conscientiousness. In contrast, the Chinese government focuses on the branches of education and tourism & culture in presenting an openness personality. The findings suggest that a consistent presentation of country personality across websites of different government branches may depend upon structural and cultural characteristics of governing. Homepages and inside pages serve different strategic purposes to create positive presentation of country personality. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"Nowadays, there is an increasing interest in non-verbal means of written forms of interpersonal communication. It is explained by the fact that the informational component and the pragmatic potential of non-verbal means of communication are often much higher than those of verbal means. As a result, the researchers focus their studies on texts which structural organization contains, in addition to verbal code units, the means of other semiotic codes. Such texts are called creolized or polycode. Polycode texts are a distinctive feature of academic texts, and their interpretation poses certain difficulties for students. The purpose of this study is to analyze the structural components of academic polycode texts; to study the ways of organizing verbal and iconic components; to describe the functional characteristics of iconic elements; to establish the mechanisms of interaction between linguistic and paralinguistic means when creating a single semantic unity of a polycode text. The main research methods are analysis, synthesis, comparison and observation. The textbook for the training of professional engineers Cambridge English for Engineering written by M. Ibbotson is used as the empirical material. The authors come to the following conclusions: there are four types of academic polycode texts; each type has a different pragmatic potential of verbal and iconic parts; in some types, the information function is more prominent in the iconic component; the use of photographs as iconic means facilitates the process of text interpretation and scientific and technical data exchange.  © 2023 EDP Sciences.

"Investment in human capital, along with natural resource management, is an important indicator of sustainable development. One of the areas of such investments is the creation of artificial intelligence systems that allow for the classification of texts. This paper analyzes the use of artificial intelligence systems for stylometric text analysis. On the basis of the algorithm of the convolutional artificial immune system, a system for stylometric analysis of texts was developed and implemented in software. In order to determine the possibility of using this system to determine the authorship of literary works, it was trained and tested. For this, the works of two authors were chosen: Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Kryukov. This system demonstrated a high quality of text classification and a good speed of work and learning. So, to test the performance of the system, 11 works by Leo Tolstoy and 12 works by Fedor Kryukov were taken that were not used to train the system. All works of these authors were classified correctly. It should be noted that the artificial immune system algorithm can also be successfully used in other tasks requiring text classification.  © 2023 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved."
"Background In February 2020, Canada implemented plain packaging without any changes to the size and content of health warning labels (HWLs), which were last updated in 2012 (pictorial HWLs on 75% of the pack front and back). This pre-post evaluation study assessed the impact of plain packaging in Canada on: (1) pack appeal; (2) HWL effectiveness; and (3) support for plain packaging. Additionally, a quasi–experimental design was used to assess the Canadian results relative to two comparator countries: Australia, where plain packaging (with new larger HWLs) was implemented in 2012, and the United States (USA), where plain packaging has not been implemented and the same text warnings have appeared on cigarette packs since 1985. Methods Data are from adult smokers who participated in the 2018 and/or 2020 International Tobacco Control Smoking and Vaping Surveys in Canada (n=4600), Australia (n=1834) and the USA (n=3046). Online surveys were conducted before (February to July 2018) and after (February to June 2020) the implementation of plain packaging in Canada. Adjusted regression analyses were conducted on weighted data. Results Plain packaging was associated with a significant increase in the percentage of Canadian smokers who did not like the look of their cigarette pack (2018: 28.6% vs 2020: 44.7%, p<0.001), whereas no change in pack appeal was observed among smokers in Australia and the USA over the same period. Plain packaging was not associated with changes in HWL effectiveness in Canada. Support for plain packaging increased significantly among Canadian smokers (2018: 25.6% vs 2020: 33.7%, p<0.001). Conclusions Plain packaging in Canada substantially reduced pack appeal and increased support for the policy among adult smokers; however, there was no increase in the effectiveness of Canada’s 8-year-old HWLs. The impact of plain packaging on health warning effectiveness may depend on the design of the warnings and length of time since implementation. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023."
"The transition from visual programming to textual programming reveals a considerable increase in the overall complexity of programming, including a number of challenging issues. To support this transition and alleviate some of these challenges, so-called hybrid programming may be applied. This programming usually refers to the use of a single programming language in block- and text-based modalities within one computing environment. Research shows that the application of hybrid programming for a certain age group may positively contribute to the development of students' programming knowledge and skills as they proceed towards the exclusive use of text-based programming. However, teachers of programming may not be willing to do this, because of limited teaching hours, a demanding syllabus, lack of resources or for other reasons. By using a sample of 38 high school teachers of programming, this study examined teachers' opinions about applying hybrid programming in their teaching and analysed their preference for hybrid programming usage in terms of a number of background variables, such as type of school, teacher's experience and programming language used. The examination of these teachers' opinions revealed that although visual programming may be used as a scaffolding support for textual programming, the opponents of hybrid programming usage did not (realize and) acknowledge this aspect of visual programming. On the other hand, the proponents of hybrid programming usage did mention several affordances related to this aspect, but they had rarely examined them in terms of the particular challenges of the transition in question. The analysis showed that hybrid programming usage was influenced by hybrid programming experience, the text-based programming languages applied and the country region.

"Objective: To evaluate scientific production on disabled persons with dental care needs over a 20-year period. Material and Methods: The search was conducted in the PubMed database using the MeSH terms “Disabled Persons” AND “Dentistry”. Three researchers selected articles based on readings of the title, abstract and full text. The articles were categorized according to periodical, country, study design, subject and classification of comorbidities and associated disorders. Three hundred ninety-seven articles published in 140 periodicals were included. Results: The periodicals Special Care in Dentistry (54), Dental Clinics of North America (14) and British Dental Journal (14) accounted for 21% of the publications. The studies were conducted in 50 countries, with the United States accounting for 33%. More than half (52%) of the studies had a cross-sectional design. The main subject addressed was oral diagnosis and most of the comorbidities were generalized disabilities. Conclusion: Although a large number of the periodicals have contributed to knowledge building on disabled persons with dental care needs, the number of articles is small compared to other fields of dentistry. Moreover, important gaps in knowledge persist and projects with better methodological designs are needed to offer a more substantial contribution to clinical practice. © 2023, Association of Support to Oral Health Research (APESB).

"Biomedical argument mining aims to automatically identify and extract the argumentative structure in biomedical text. It helps to determine not only what positions people adopt, but also why they hold such opinions, which provides valuable insights into medical decision making. Generally, biomedical argument mining consists of three subtasks: argument component identification, argument component classification and relation identification. Current approaches employ conventional multi-task learning framework for jointly addressing the latter two subtasks, and achieve some success. However, explicit sequential dependency between these two subtasks is ignored, which is crucial for accurate biomedical argument mining. Moreover, relation identification is conducted solely based on the argument component pair without considering its potentially valuable context. Therefore, in this paper, a novel sequential multi-task learning approach is proposed for biomedical argument mining. Specifically, to model explicit sequential dependency between argument component classification and relation identification, an information transfer strategy is employed to capture the information of argument component type that is transferred to relation identification. Furthermore, graph convolutional network is employed to model dependency relation among the related argument component pairs. The proposed method has been evaluated on a benchmark dataset and the experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.  © 2004-2012 IEEE."
"How do writers from regions with a historical experience of colonialism depict Western Orientalists in their work? What exactly does it mean to “reverse the gaze” and include the Orientalist within the frame of representation? The article considers the non-Western representation of Orientalists and Orientalism in literary texts from three different regions (Turkey, Mexico, and Bengal), concentrating in particular on Oguz Atay’s Tutunamayanlar (The Disconnected), Ignacio Padilla’s Antipodes, and Amitav Ghosh’s In an Antique Land, but also referring to a wide selection of other texts in the process. It suggests three categories of such representation — parodic, empathetic, and authoritative, in ascending order of sympathy — and proposes, in the analysis of the various fictitious representations of Orientalists examined, a central link between Orientalism and the sacred. Finally, the question of the ironic representation of Orientalists — the extent to which a redemptive irony is adopted by structures of power as a tool of self-preservation — is also considered. © The Author(s) 2020."

"For several years machine learning methods have been proposed for risk classification. While machine learning methods have also been used for failure diagnosis and condition monitoring, to the best of our knowledge, these methods have not been used for probabilistic risk assessment. Probabilistic risk assessment is a subjective process. The problem of how well machine learning methods can emulate expert judgments is challenging. Expert judgments are based on mental shortcuts, heuristics, which are susceptible to biases. This paper presents a process for developing natural language-based probabilistic risk assessment models, applying deep learning algorithms to emulate experts’ quantified risk estimates. This allows the risk analyst to obtain an a priori risk assessment when there is limited information in the form of text and numeric data. Universal sentence embedding (USE) with gradient boosting regression (GBR) trees trained over limited structured data presented the most promising results. When we apply these models’ outputs to generate survival distributions for autonomous systems’ likelihood of loss with distance, we observe that for open water and ice shelf operating environments, the differences between the survival distributions generated by the machine learning algorithm and those generated by the experts are not statistically significant. © 2022 The Authors.

"Background: Delivered globally to promote adolescents’ sexual and reproductive health, comprehensive sex education (CSE) is rights-based, holistic, and seeks to enhance young people’s skills to foster respectful and healthy relationships. Previous research has demonstrated that CSE programmes that incorporate critical content on gender and power in relationships are more effective in achieving positive sexual and reproductive health outcomes than programmes without this content. However, it is not well understood how these programmes ultimately affect behavioural and biological outcomes. We therefore sought to investigate underlying mechanisms of impact and factors affecting implementation and undertook a systematic review of process evaluation studies reporting on school-based sex education programmes with a gender and power component. Methods: We searched six scientific databases in June 2019 and screened 9375 titles and abstracts and 261 full-text articles. Two distinct analyses and syntheses were conducted: a narrative review of implementation studies and a thematic synthesis of qualitative studies that examined programme characteristics and mechanisms of impact. Results: Nineteen articles met the inclusion criteria of which eleven were implementation studies. These studies highlighted the critical role of the skill and training of the facilitator, flexibility to adapt programmes to students’ needs, and a supportive school/community environment in which to deliver CSE to aid successful implementation. In the second set of studies (n = 8), student participation, student-facilitator relationship-building, and open discussions integrating student reflection and experience-sharing with critical content on gender and power were identified as important programme characteristics. These were linked to empowerment, transformation of gender norms, and meaningful contextualisation of students’ experiences as underlying mechanisms of impact. Conclusion and policy implications: Our findings emphasise the need for CSE programming addressing gender and power that engages students in a meaningful, relatable manner. Our findings can inform theories of change and intervention development for such programmes. © 2021, The Author(s)."
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the care of many cancer patients in a variety of ways. This study was conducted to understand the experience cancer patients have had during the pandemic. Method: Cancer patients who were under the care of the Trust between September 2020 – January 2021 were invited to take part in a survey sent through as a text message. Results: A total of 600 patients were sent a text message with a link to an online survey. There were 82 patients who responded. The data has been divided into three themes of information provision and safety around COVID-19, impact on cancer care and feeling supported by staff. Conclusion: It was encouraging to see that patients felt safe coming into the hospitals if it was required and they received appropriate information about changes to their care and how to protect themselves against COVID-19. Most patients stated that the pandemic had not influenced their cancer care. Of those that did experience delays most were understanding of this. There was a mixture of responses in terms of patients feeling supported by staff, most inpatients did feel supported and 75% of patients were able to contact their specialist nurse. © The Author(s) 2021."
"The cross-section area is a crucial parameter to assess peripheral neuropathy. The ultrasonographic evaluation of cross-section area of median nerve is a low-cost and readily available tool for diagnosis and assessment. However, the intra-nerve dimensional variability and its normative reference value in a healthy subject are missing. The current meta-analysis aims to capture the median nerve cross-section area for healthy subjects and generate a comprehensive ultrasonographic reference data set for each population. Methods: The full text of manuscripts were collected after short-listing the abstracts collected from search strategy. A quality assurance tool was used to capture the risk of bias of each study after reviewing the included manuscripts. The pooled estimate of cross-section area was stratified according to anatomical landmarks, sex, and ancestry. Results: A total of 97 observational studies dealt with 6679 wrists of healthy subjects were included. The pooled estimate of the cross-section area of median nerve at carpal tunnel inlet was 8.54 mm2 [95% CI: 8.34–8.74 mm2]. The same pooled estimate at carpal tunnel outlet was 8.03 mm2 [95% CI: 7.46–8.60 mm2]. Both these pooled estimates have significant correlation with mean age of population. Age and sex were two primary predictors of the cross-section of median nerve. The flattening ratio, circularity, and wrist-forearm ratio of median nerve were also computed. Conclusion: These normative data could serve as a reference for assessing median nerve pathologies, including carpal tunnel syndrome. The ethnic variation of pooled estimate and heterogeneity will guide clinician set up the reference value for diagnostic criteria. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS"

"Owing to the rising needs of English language for communication at a global level, experts have stressed the significance of teaching English supported by materials based on communicative language teaching (CLT) principles to facilitate the development of communicative competence. This study, therefore, aims to evaluate ESL teaching materials to check their suitability to develop learners' communicative competence. The study, for this purpose, employs content analysis approach for the analysis of text of English designed for class two in the light of a checklist devised on CLT principles. The results reveal that the content of the said textbook does not conform to the CLT principles. Therefore, it is not suitable to facilitate the development of communicative competence in the learners. The study suggests either to improve/revise the textbook or to replace it by another suitable one. © 2023 by IGI Global. All rights reserved."
"Natural language processing (NLP) models are known vulnerable to adversarial examples, similar to image processing models. Studying adversarial texts is an essential step to improve the robustness of NLP models. However, existing studies mainly focus on generating adversarial texts for English, with no prior knowledge that whether those attacks could be applied to Chinese. After analyzing the differences between Chinese and English, we propose a novel adversarial Chinese text generation solution Argot, by utilizing the method for adversarial English examples and several novel methods developed on Chinese characteristics. Argot could effectively and efficiently generate adversarial Chinese texts with good readability in both white-box and black-box settings. Argot could also automatically generate targeted Chinese adversarial texts, achieving a high success rate and ensuring the readability of the generated texts. Furthermore, we apply Argot to the spam detection task in both local detection models and a public toxic content detection system from a well-known security company. Argot achieves a relatively high bypass success rate with fluent readability, which proves that the real-world toxic content detection system is vulnerable to adversarial example attacks. We also evaluate some available defense strategies, and the results indicate that Argot can still achieve high attack success rates.  © 2004-2012 IEEE."
"With the surge of COVID-19 pandemic, the world is moving towards digitization and automation more than it was presumed. The Internet is becoming one of the popular mediums for communication, and multimedia (image, audio, and video) combined with data compression techniques play a pivotal role in handling a huge volume of data that is being generated on a daily basis. Developing novel algorithms for automatic analysis of compressed data without decompression is the need of the present hour. JPEG is a popular compression algorithm supported in the digital electronics world that achieves compression by dividing the whole image into non-overlapping blocks of 8 × 8 pixels, and subsequently transforming each block using Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). This research paper proposes to carry out Fast and Smooth Segmentation (FastSS) directly in JPEG compressed printed text document images at text-line and word-level using DC and AC signals. From each 8 × 8 block, DC and AC signals are analyzed for accomplishing Fast and Smooth segmentation, and subsequently, two Faster segmentation (MFastSS) algorithms are also devised using low resolution-images generated by mapping the DC signal (DC Reduced Image) and encoded DCT (ECM Image) coefficients separately. Proposed models are tested on various JPEG compressed printed text document images created with varied space and fonts. The experimental results have demonstrated that the direct analysis of compressed streams is computationally efficient, and has achieved speed gain more than 90% when compared to uncompressed domains. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Objective This study, conducted in China, evaluated the effectiveness of four different themes of health warning labels (HWLs) that used both text and pictures: (1) self-harm from using cigarettes, (2) harming family or children with secondhand smoke, (3) reinforcing compliance with existing smoke-free policies and (4) anticigarette gift giving practices. Methods A cross-sectional randomised experimental survey was conducted among 3247 adult (aged 18+ years) participants in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in 2017, using quotas for age group, gender and smoking status. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the four HWL themes. Each participant viewed eight HWLs and rated how effective these themed-labels were in terms of credibility, raising awareness of health harms of smoking on family and children, improving compliance with public smoking bans, stopping the practice of gifting cigarettes, thinking about quitting and preventing smoking using a 10-point scale, with 10 being most effective. Analysis of variance and independent t-tests were used to analyse these data. Findings All four HWL themes performed well for each outcome with average ratings >6.5. Harming family or children with secondhand smoke was the theme that received the highest ratings for each outcome, with credibility (8.0, 95% CI 7.86 to 8.09) and prevention of smoking (8.8, 95% CI 8.63 to 8.91) outcomes being significantly higher (p<0.05). Overall, analysis of ratings by gender, income and education did not impact outcomes. Conclusion All four HWL themes tested could be effective in China; the theme of secondhand smoke harming family or children may be a particularly credible/ effective theme. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023."
"Purpose: Digital media has brought a revolution, making the world a global village. For people who are visually impaired and people with visual and hearing impairment, navigating through the digital world can be as precarious as moving through the real world. To enable them to connect with the digital world, we propose a solution, Haptic Encoded Language Framework (HELF), that uses haptic technology to enable them to write digital text using swiping gestures and understand the text through vibrations. Method: We developed an Android application to present the concept of HELF and evaluate its performance. We tested the application on 13 users (five visually impaired and eight sighted individuals). Results: The preliminary exploratory analysis of the proposed framework using the Android application developed reveals encouraging results. Overall, the reading accuracy has been found to be approximately 91%, and the average CPM is found to be 25.7. Conclusion: The volunteering users of the HELF Android application found it useful as a means of using the digital media and recommended its usage as an assistive technology for the visually challenged. The results of their performance of using the application motivate further research and development in the proposed work to make HELF more usable by people who are visually impaired and people with visual and hearing impairment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Thousands of new publications appear every day in bibliometric databases, so the demand for document retrieval technology is growing. Bibliometrics makes it possible to perform a quantitative analysis of text publications; however, the problem of classifying complex videos with a high level of semantics remains unsolved. Meanwhile, short-form videos gain popularity and attract more researchers. Knowledge Graph seems to be a promising technology in this area. This technology makes it possible to modernize the information search infrastructure. The experiment involved 461 short-video studies. The material for the experiment was collected from the Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index (CSSCI) database. The bibliometric method was recognized as expedient for the analysis. The keyword mapping and clustering operations were performed using the CiteSpace software. The results demonstrate that short-form video research has been popular among Chinese scientists since 2017. Short-form video research focuses on five major topics, that is, development trends, modern media convergence, video production, visual content management, and short-form videos in the public sector. The present findings may be employed in future research to collect relevant samples with exact semantic relationships. The technology is not limited to specific applications and, therefore, may be useful in any field of research. © The Author(s) 2021."
"Purpose: Most educational assessments tend to be constructed in a close-ended format, which is easier to score consistently and more affordable. However, recent work has leveraged computation text methods from the information sciences to make open-ended measurement more effective and reliable for older students. The purpose of this study is to determine whether models used by computational text mining applications need to be adapted when used with samples of elementary-aged children. Design/methodology/approach: This study introduces domain-adapted semantic models for child-specific text analysis, to allow better elementary-aged educational assessment. A corpus compiled from a multimodal mix of spoken and written child-directed sources is presented, used to train a children’s language model and evaluated against standard non-age-specific semantic models. Findings: Child-oriented language is found to differ in vocabulary and word sense use from general English, while exhibiting lower gender and race biases. The model is evaluated in an educational application of divergent thinking measurement and shown to improve on generalized English models. Research limitations/implications: The findings demonstrate the need for age-specific language models in the growing domain of automated divergent thinking and strongly encourage the same for other educational uses of computation text analysis by showing a measurable difference in the language of children. Social implications: Understanding children’s language more representatively in automated educational assessment allows for more fair and equitable testing. Furthermore, child-specific language models have fewer gender and race biases. Originality/value: Research in computational measurement of open-ended responses has thus far used models of language trained on general English sources or domain-specific sources such as textbooks. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first to study age-specific language models for educational assessment. In addition, while there have been several targeted, high-quality corpora of child-created or child-directed speech, the corpus presented here is the first developed with the breadth and scale required for large-scale text modeling. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"This article analyses the parallel representations of enemy warrior women as sexually profligate and inappropriately martial in selected Latin and Arabic texts from the period of the first three crusades (late eleventh to late twelfth centuries). Cross-cultural comparison of depictions of fighting women demonstrates that both cultures portrayed the other side as dominated, and thus undermined, by women who were unnaturally assertive in both sexual and military affairs. Both Muslim and Christian authors sexualised and militarised the bodies of enemy women in order to define which men were the strongest, best and most deserving of battlefield victory in the holy wars of crusade and jihad. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Objective To describe and synthesise studies of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence by occupation prior to the widespread vaccine roll-out. Methods We identified studies of occupational seroprevalence from a living systematic review (PROSPERO CRD42020183634). Electronic databases, grey literature and news media were searched for studies published during January-December 2020. Seroprevalence estimates and a free-text description of the occupation were extracted and classified according to the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) 2010 system using a machine-learning algorithm. Due to heterogeneity, results were synthesised narratively. Results We identified 196 studies including 591 940 participants from 38 countries. Most studies (n=162; 83%) were conducted locally versus regionally or nationally. Sample sizes were generally small (median=220 participants per occupation) and 135 studies (69%) were at a high risk of bias. One or more estimates were available for 21/23 major SOC occupation groups, but over half of the estimates identified (n=359/600) were for healthcare-related occupations. â € Personal Care and Service Occupations' (median 22% (IQR 9-28%); n=14) had the highest median seroprevalence. Conclusions Many seroprevalence studies covering a broad range of occupations were published in the first year of the pandemic. Results suggest considerable differences in seroprevalence between occupations, although few large, high-quality studies were done. Well-designed studies are required to improve our understanding of the occupational risk of SARS-CoV-2 and should be considered as an element of pandemic preparedness for future respiratory pathogens.  © World Health Organization 2023.

"Objective: Depression and anxiety cause a high burden of disease and have high relapse rates (39%-72%). This meta-analysis systematically examined effectiveness of relapse prevention strategies on risk of and time to relapse in youth who remitted. Method: PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, Cochrane, and ERIC databases were searched up to June 15, 2021. Eligible studies compared relapse prevention strategies to control conditions among youth (mean age 13-25 years) who were previously depressed or anxious or with ≥30% improvement in symptoms. Two reviewers independently assessed titles, abstracts, and full texts; extracted study data; and assessed risk of bias and overall strength of evidence. Random-effects models were used to pool results, and mixed-effects models were used for subgroup analyses. Main outcome was relapse rate at last follow-up (PROSPERO ID: CRD42020149326). Results: Of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined depression, 9 were eligible for analysis: 4 included psychological interventions (n = 370), 3 included antidepressants (n = 80), and 2 included combinations (n = 132). No RCTs for anxiety were identified. Over 6 to 75 months, relapse was half as likely following psychological treatment compared with care as usual conditions (k = 6; odds ratio 0.56, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.00). Sensitivity analyses including only studies with ≥50 participants (k = 3), showed similar results. Over 6 to 12 months, relapse was less likely in youth receiving antidepressants compared with youth receiving pill placebo (k = 3; OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.82). Quality of studies was suboptimal. Conclusion: Relapse prevention strategies for youth depression reduce risk of relapse, although adequately powered, high-quality RCTs are needed. This finding, together with the lack of RCTs on anxiety, underscores the need to examine relapse prevention in youth facing these common mental health conditions. © 2022 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry"
"This book explores the response to a new scientific advance in medicine three hundred years ago to understand how this discourse revealed religious, racial, anti-intellectual, and other ideologies the first time documented vaccinations were introduced in America. This text serves as a case study that examines the historic discourses surrounding the implementation of a new prevention technique, smallpox inoculation, to prevent the devastating epidemics of smallpox that had visited the new colonies since their start on the American continent. Using this detailed analysis of the arguments surrounding the project in early America, the author examines the various arguments that circulated in the 1720s regarding the project. When compared to today's pandemic, this study argues that Americans over-react and complicate scientific applications not with logical scientific perspectives or even with ethical views, but instead bring exaggerated claims founded on uniquely American historical, religious, racial, territorial, and political ideologies. America's First Vaccination will be of interest to anyone interested in American history, the history of medicine, cultural studies, and a comparison to current pandemic events. © 2023 Barbara Heifferon.

"Statement of problem: Evidence for the efficacy and safety of natural products for the treatment of denture stomatitis is lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this systematic review was to answer the question “Are topical natural substances effective and safe compared with conventional antifungals in the treatment of denture stomatitis?” Material and methods: A structured search in 11 databases, including non-peer-reviewed, was undertaken. Two authors independently selected the studies, extracted the data, assessed the study quality, and graded the evidence, with disagreement resolved with a third reviewer. Data were evaluated descriptively by following Synthesis Without Meta-analysis (SWiM) reporting items. This study was registered at the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), number CRD42020216213. Results: After the removal of duplicates, 1925 records remained, and after a 2-phase reading of abstracts and full texts, 17 studies were included. Propolis, green tea, ginger, Zataria multiflora, chitosan, garlic, Artemisia, Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi, Uncaria tomentosa, Punica granatum, and Ricinus communis appeared to have similar efficacy and safety when compared with nystatin or miconazole. Most of the studies presented a high risk of bias. Conclusions: Certainty in the body of evidence that natural products might be appropriately used in the treatment of denture stomatitis is low. Well-designed randomized controlled trials are still needed to evaluate the topic better because there is high heterogeneity among the studies. © 2021 Editorial Council for the Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry"
"Objective: The main objective of this review was to map the literature on the characteristics of patient navigation programs for people with dementia, their caregivers, and members of the care team across all settings. The secondary objective was to map the literature on the barriers and facilitators for implementing and delivering such patient navigation programs. Introduction: People with dementia have individualized needs that change according to the stage of their condition. They often face fragmented and uncoordinated care when seeking support to address these needs. Patient navigation may be one way to help people with dementia access better care. Patient navigation is a model of care that aims to guide people through the health care system, matching their unmet needs to appropriate resources, services, and programs. Organizing the available information on this topic will present a clearer picture of how patient navigation programs work. Inclusion criteria: This review focused on the characteristics of patient navigation programs for people living with dementia, their caregivers, and the members of the care team. It excluded programs not explicitly focused on dementia. It included patient navigation across all settings, delivered in all formats, and administered by all types of navigators if the programs aligned with this review's definition of patient navigation. This review excluded case management programs. Methods: This review was conducted in accordance with JBI methodology for scoping reviews. MEDLINE, CINAHL, APA PsycINFO, Embase, and ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health databases were searched for published full-text articles. A gray literature search was also conducted. Two independent reviewers screened articles for relevance against the inclusion criteria. The results are presented in a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram, and the extracted data are presented narratively and in tabular format. Results: Thirty-nine articles describing 20 programs were included in this review. The majority of these articles were published between 2015 and 2020, and based out of the United States. The types of sources included randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and qualitative exploratory studies, among others. All programs provided some form of referral or linkage to other services or resources. Most dementia navigation programs included an interdisciplinary team, and most programs were community-based. There was no consistent patient navigator title or standard delivery method. Commonly reported barriers to implementing and delivering these programs were navigator burnout and a lack of coordination between stakeholders. Commonly reported facilitators were collaboration, communication, and formal partnerships between key stakeholders, as well as accessible and flexible program delivery models. Conclusions: This review demonstrates variety and flexibility in the types of services patient navigation programs provided, as well as in the modes of service delivery and in navigator title. This information may be useful for individuals and organizations looking to implement their own programs in the future. It also provides a framework for future systematic reviews that seek to evaluate the effectiveness or efficacy of dementia navigation programs. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables knowledge transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain by reducing the cross-domain distribution discrepancy, and the adversarial learning based paradigm has achieved remarkable success. On top of the derived domain-invariant feature representations, a promising stream of recent works seeks to further regularize the classification decision boundary via self-training to learn target adaptive classifier with pseudo-labeled target samples. However, since the pseudo labels are inevitably noisy, most of prior methods focus on manually designing elaborate target selection algorithms or optimization objectives to combat the negative effect caused by the incorrect pseudo labels. Different from them, in this paper, we propose a simple and powerful meta-learning based target-reweighting regularization algorithm, called MetaReg, which regularizes the model training by learning to reweight the noisy pseudo-labeled target samples. Specifically, MetaReg is motivated by the intuition that an ideal target classifier trained on correct target pseudo labels should make small classification errors on target-like source samples. Therefore, we explicitly define a meta reweighting problem that aims to find the optimal weights for different target pseudo labels by minimizing the classification loss on a designed validation set, a class-balanced set consisting of source samples that are most similar to target ones. Note that the optimization problem can be solved efficiently with a simplified approximation technique. As a result, the automatically learned optimal weights are utilized to reweight pseudo-labeled target samples, and regularize the model learning by target supervision with the learned different importance. Comprehensive experiments on several cross-domain image and text datasets verify that MetaReg could outperform the non-regularized UDA counterparts with state-of-the-art performance.

"The degree of Shakespeare's concern for a ""living theatre,"" capable of perpetually diversifying in order to maintain its appeal, is immediately apparent in the imaginative opening strategies employed in his plays. In an effort to illuminate them, this book studies the early printed texts for evidence of the opening lines of composition, as well as information supplied by Shakespeare for the actor to translate written word into stage action. This book contains a detailed introduction to its subject. Part One presents relevant ideas about openings in rhetorical and poetic theory from Aristotle to Julius Caesar Scaliger. In drawing on these ideas-and without making too strong a claim about direct or indirect influence-author Joel Benabu constructs a theoretical framework for Shakespeare's opening strategies. Part Two, comprising the main section of the book, explores different strategies for constructing an opening in the Shakespearean plays selected for analysis. The conclusion takes a broader perspective on the theory of Shakespeare's construction of openings explored throughout the book. © 2023 Joel Benabu. All rights reserved."
"This work is devoted to the processes of organizing internal information security at the enterprise. The scheme of a software tool for monitoring employee communication and detecting malicious messages using artificial neural network analysis and full-text dictionary search is proposed. A software package designed according to the described scheme has been developed. The scheme of interaction of the program components is considered: a keylogger, a keyboard input analyzer, a user interface, a server coordinating interaction. The schemes of interaction with the analyzer by means of the WebSocket protocol were shown. The interaction of the neural network and the dictionary helped to increase the percentage of accuracy of detecting a dangerous or suspicious message, for example, when the neural network does not consider the text dangerous, and the dictionary considers the opposite, then such text is considered dangerous and is shown to the administrator. Thus, the combination of neural network analysis and dictionary analysis makes it possible to detect more suspicious messages. The work of the software product and its advantages in comparison with other similar systems are demonstrated.  © 2023 EDP Sciences. All rights reserved."
"After more than 25 years of scholarship, the deliberative turn in international relations (IR) theory is ready to be revisited with a fresh perspective. Using new methods from automated text analyses, this explorative article investigates how rhetoric may bind action. It does so by building upon Schimmelfennig’s original account of rhetorical entrapment. To begin, I theorize the opposite of entrapment, which I call rhetorical hollowing. Rhetorical hollowing describes a situation in which actors use normative rhetoric, but instead of advancing their interests, such rhetoric fails to increase their chances of obtaining the desired outcome because the normative force of their rhetoric has eroded over time. To provide plausibility to both entrapment and hollowing, I present two mechanisms by which language is connected with action in the United Nations Security Council. Finally, I run a series of time-series-cross-section models on selected dictionary terms conducive to entrapment or hollowing on all speeches and an original Security Council resolution corpus from 1995 to 2017. The research shows that while mentioning ‘human rights’ is consistently associated with increased odds of authorization of force; the word ‘terrorism’ is associated with a decrease of odds for intervention. This finding suggests that some terms may not only entrap or hollow but also normatively backfire. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Swearing plays an ubiquitous role in everyday conversations among humans, both in oral and textual communication, and occurs frequently in social media texts, typically featured by informal language and spontaneous writing. Such occurrences can be linked to an abusive context, when they contribute to the expression of hatred and to the abusive effect, causing harm and offense. However, swearing is multifaceted and is often used in casual contexts, also with positive social functions. In this study, we explore the phenomenon of swearing in Twitter conversations, by automatically predicting the abusiveness of a swear word in a tweet as the main investigation perspective. We developed the Twitter English corpus SWAD (Swear Words Abusiveness Dataset), where abusive swearing is manually annotated at the word level. Our collection consists of 2577 instances in total from two phases of manual annotation. We developed models to automatically predict abusive swearing, to provide an intrinsic evaluation of SWAD and confirm the robustness of the resource. We model this prediction task as three different tasks, namely sequence labeling, text classification, and target-based swear word abusiveness prediction. We experimentally found that our intention to model the task similarly to aspect-based sentiment analysis leads to promising results. Subsequently, we employ the classifier to improve the prediction of abusive language in several standard benchmarks. The results of our experiments show that additional abusiveness feature of the swear words is able to improve the performance of abusive language detection models in several benchmark datasets. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various tasks (e.g., image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing (NLP)). However, researchers have demonstrated that DNN-based models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which cause erroneous predictions by adding imperceptible perturbations into legitimate inputs. Recently, studies have revealed adversarial examples in the text domain, which could effectively evade various DNN-based text analyzers and further bring the threats of the proliferation of disinformation. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey on the existing studies of adversarial techniques for generating adversarial texts written by both English and Chinese characters and the corresponding defense methods. More importantly, we hope that our work could inspire future studies to develop more robust DNN-based text analyzers against known and unknown adversarial techniques. We classify the existing adversarial techniques for crafting adversarial texts based on the perturbation units, helping to better understand the generation of adversarial texts and build robust models for defense. In presenting the taxonomy of adversarial attacks and defenses in the text domain, we introduce the adversarial techniques from the perspective of different NLP tasks. Finally, we discuss the existing challenges of adversarial attacks and defenses in texts and present the future research directions in this emerging and challenging field.  © 1989-2012 IEEE."
"The identity and institutional image of universities are presented to the world through their websites. On their websites, universities publish their academic offerings, their mission, their vision, their academic objectives, their achievements, their regulations, their news and all their university work. Hence, the importance of university websites is accessible. The accessibility of university websites has been evaluated several times in the past, but there is no work that has summarized all the evaluations performed to provide a general overview of the situation. Therefore, in this research we have performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to consolidate, analyze, synthesize and interpret the accessibility results of university websites published in 42 papers that have been selected for this study. The methodology used in this SLR was that proposed in Kitchenham’s guidelines, which includes three stages: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. The results present the analysis and synthesis of the evaluations of 9,140 universities in 67 countries. Of these, 38,416 web pages, 91,421 YouTube videos and 28,395 PDF documents were evaluated. Manual methods, methods with automatic tools and the combination of both methods were used for the evaluation. Most websites were evaluated using the ISO/IEC 40500:2012 and Section 508 standards. The accessibility guidelines most commonly violated in the evaluations were: adaptable, compatible, distinguishable, input assistance, keyboard accessible, navigable, predictable, readable and text alternatives. In conclusion, the university websites, YouTube videos and PDF documents analyzed in the 42 papers present important accessibility problems. The main contribution of this SLR is the consolidation of the results of the 42 studies selected to determine the findings and trends in the accessibility of university websites around the world. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Business closure is a critical stage in the lifecycle of any business. Despite a body of literature on the factors influencing business failure and/or success, studies on business closure prediction are next to none. Additionally, the identification of those factors has focused primarily on the managerial and economic dimensions rather than the consumer dimension. This research investigates the prediction of business closure from online consumer reviews, and validates the predictive models in the restaurant industry, which is subject to a relatively high attrition rate. Our proposed method for predicting business closure includes several novel artifacts, including integrating deep learning and time-series analysis techniques, extracting information embedded in online reviews using a hybrid classification method, and incorporating a novel triple word embedding model for text representation. The evaluation results of the proposed method using Yelp online reviews demonstrate its superior performance in business closure prediction, which indicate that online reviews provide strong signals for predicting business closure. We conduct another experiment with review data collected from TripAdvisors.com, and the experiment results are consistent, which provide evidence for the generalizability of the proposed method. The findings of this research have important managerial implications for business and investment decision making. © 1988-2012 IEEE."
"In patients with existing ovarian function, there are some special aspects to adjuvant endocrine therapy in premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative (HR pos./HER2 neg.) breast cancer. Treatment options include tamoxifen with or without a GnRH analog, and aromatase inhibitors with a GnRH analog. Furthermore, ovarian function is affected by previous chemotherapy. Both aromatase inhibitors (+GnRH analogs) and GnRH analogs in combination with tamoxifen are supposed to be indicated for patients at increased risk of recurrence. However, national and international guidelines and therapy recommendations do not provide a clear definition of intermediate or high risk; as a result, therapy decisions are often made for each patient on an individual basis. This is also reflected in the considerable variability at national and international levels, e.g., with regard to the use of aromatase inhibitors + GnRH analogs. This review summarizes the data on completed studies (e.g., SOFT, TEXT, EBCTCG meta-analyses) and the current multigene testing studies (TailorX, RxPonder, ADAPT), discusses the rationale for current studies (e.g., CLEAR-B), and looks ahead to future questions. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag.

"Much of Cracking India’s scholarship focuses on how the text provides a representation of gendered trauma during Partition. These analyses, however, overlook the reader’s role, which minimizes literary works to analyzable objects rather than interactive opportunities. Following the work of postcolonial trauma scholars such as Steph Craps, Abigail Ward, and Jay Rajiva, I argue that postcolonial trauma narratives are crucial spaces of testimony in which the ongoing traumatic effects of colonialism intersect with reader engagement. Using Dori Laub’s trauma interview model, I examine how Bapsi Sidhwa uses the narrative techniques of perspective, time, and presence in Cracking India to implicate the reader as a witness in gendered postcolonial trauma affecting women. In pairing the examination of how narrative technique engages the reader as a witness with current scholarship on gender in Sidhwa’s novel, I show how such consideration of the reader speaks to how gendered violence contributes to postcolonial identity formation over time. © The Author(s) 2020."
"Objective: To assess for differences in surgical site infection (SSI) rates and bacterial load after major mucosal head and neck surgery between patients who received topical antimicrobial prophylaxis and those who did not. Data Sources: Ovid Medline, Embase, SCOPUS, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception to May 20, 2021, with cross-referencing of retrieved studies per PRISMA guidelines. Review Methods: Inclusion criteria captured clinical trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies with infectious outcomes of adults who underwent major mucosal head and neck surgery and received perioperative topical antimicrobial therapy to the oral cavity and/or pharynx. Studies of dental procedures were excluded. The primary outcome was SSI rate, and the secondary outcome was bacterial load. Two blinded investigators screened each text. Results: Of 265 unique citations, 9 studies of 470 total patients were included. Topical treatments included numerous antibiotics and antiseptics directly applied over mucosa. Pooled SSI rates of 252 patients in the intervention cohort and 218 in the control cohort were 8% (95% CI, 3%-14%; I 2 = 61.2%) and 29% (95% CI, 16%-43%; I 2 = 79.5%), respectively. A meta-analysis of 7 comparative studies totaling 192 patients receiving topical therapy and 218 control patients revealed a pooled relative risk of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.28-0.68; I 2 = 0.0%) in favor of the treatment group. The studies demonstrated a short-term decrease in bacterial counts after topical antimicrobial prophylaxis. Conclusion: Patients who underwent prophylactic topical antimicrobial therapy had less than half the risk of developing SSI after mucosal head and neck surgery when compared with those who received no topical prophylaxis. © 2022 American Academy of Otolaryngology–Head and Neck Surgery Foundation."
"This study aimed to understand the role that parents play in sharing or limiting their child’s access to information about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A subset of data from an international mixed methods online survey study was analysed to elucidate the findings from Brazil. An online survey, conducted between April and June 2020, gathered closed and open text views from parents of children aged 7–12 years old. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative open text data were analysed using the three stages of the Bardin content analysis framework: pre-analysis (data organisation and initial full-content reading); exploration of the material (thematic coding to identify major motifs and develop thematic categories) and interpretation (treating the data as significant and valid). The sample consisted of 112 (89%) mothers and 14 (11%) fathers. The analysis of the parents open text resulted in two categories: ‘How parents share information with their children about COVID-19’ and ‘How parents limit information to their children about COVID-19’. Some parents reported adopting an honest and open approach on how they shared information with their children, whilst some parents chose to minimise their child’s access to information about the pandemic over concerns of the mortality related to COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2021."
"The adoption and sustainability of evidence-based Tier 1 literacy practices in secondary content-area classes is important to improve reading success for students with learning disabilities. We conducted an exploratory multiple-case study investigating teachers’ adoption and sustained use of evidence-based Tier 1 literacy practices that benefit students with learning disabilities. The study was conducted within the context of an adolescent literacy model demonstration project funded by the U.S. Office of Special Education Programs (i.e., Promoting Adolescents’ Comprehension of Text [PACT] Plus). Interviews were conducted with two administrators and seven teachers who sustained implementation of the PACT practices beyond 1 year of researcher support. Analyses revealed practice and school-level factors that influenced teachers’ sustained use of the practices. We used findings from this study to propose a model of sustainability of Tier 1 evidence-based literacy practices used to improve outcomes for students with learning disabilities.

"The paper explores ways of increasing environmental awareness of students through incorporation of sustainability-related issues into a general English language course. We view language as a living system promoting life-sustaining relationships of humans with each other and with their natural environments. We hold the view that learning English as a foreign language holds powerful potential to promote the values of sustainable development, which should not be overlooked by English language teaching staff. The results of the study show that sustainability concerns are treated as discrete problems in textbooks and are often narrowed down to environmental issues, while social justice issues are left out of consideration. The percentage of units covering sustainability-related topics is considered unsatisfactory. According to the sentiment analysis conducted for textual material, the neutral sentiment is dominant, which can reduce the desired educational effect of sustainability-related texts. The author arrives at the conclusion that reconceptualization of the course framework is needed and presents practical suggestions aimed at developing a more holistic worldview and raising ecological awareness without fundamentally restructuring the whole textbook.  © 2023 EDP Sciences.

"The paper develops a research approach that combines digital ethnography with text mining to explore consumers’ perception of a brand and the degree of alignment between brand identity and image. In particular, the paper investigates the alignment between the art museum’s brand identity and the brand image emerging from visitors’ narratives of their experience. The study adopts a mixed methodology based on netnography and text mining techniques. The analysis concerns an art museum’s brand, with the case of the “Opera del Duomo Museum” in Florence. The methodological approach enables a combined investigation of user-generated content in online communities and the company’s online brand communication, contributing to identifying branding actions that can be taken to increase the brand alignment. It also enables the measurement of the degree of alignment between museums and visitors among common brand themes. Specific indicators of alignment are provided. A key point is the replicability of the model in other contexts of analysis in which the content produced by consumers in online contexts are relevant and readily available, such as fashion or food. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"With the rapid development of natural language processing techniques, the use of language models in text classification and sentiment analysis has been increasing. However, language models are susceptible to piracy and redistribution by adversaries, posing a serious threat to the intellectual property of model owners. Therefore, re-searchers have been working on designing protection mechanisms to identify the copyright information of language models. However, existing watermarking of language models for text classification tasks cannot be associated with the owner’s identity, and they are not robust enough and cannot regenerate trigger sets. To solve these problems, a new model, namely black-box watermarking scheme for text classification tasks, was proposed. It was a scheme that can remotely and quickly verify model ownership. The copyright message and the key of the model owner were obtained through the Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC), and the message digest obtained by HMAC can prevent forgery and had high security. A certain amount of text data was randomly selected from each category of the original training set and the digest was combined with the text data to construct the trigger set, then the watermark was embedded on the language model during the training process. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, watermarks were embedded on three common language models on the IMDB’s movie reviews and CNews text classification datasets. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed watermarking verification scheme can reach 100% without affecting the original model. Even under common attacks such as model fine-tuning and prun-ing, the proposed watermarking scheme shows strong robustness and resistance to forgery attacks. Meanwhile, the embedding of the watermark does not affect the convergence time of the model and has high embedding efficiency. © 2023, Beijing Xintong Media Co., Ltd.. All rights reserved."

Data were extracted from the text, tables, and figures of publications and meta-analyzed where possible. Results: Ten publications comprising 211 thumbs were included. FMEO was associated with an improvement in pain relief and patient-reported functional outcomes, however meta-analysis showed no significant long-term improvement in grip strength or lateral pinch grip. Although there was disease progression in one third of patients after FMEO, most did not require further procedures. Outcomes following secondary procedures was not analyzed in the literature. FMEO produced a range of minor complications, however, major complications were rare. Conclusions: The available evidence suggests FMEO does not improve grip or pinch strength. However, it may have a role in analgesia and improvement in functional outcomes. Further studies should compare outcomes of FMEO to continued nonoperative treatment, or other surgical options including arthroscopy or ligamentous reconstruction. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Relation classification (RC) task is one of fundamental tasks of information extraction, aiming to detect the relation information between entity pairs in unstructured natural language text and generate structured data in the form of entity-relation triple. Although distant supervision methods can effectively alleviate the problem of lack of training data in supervised learning, they also introduce noise into the data and still cannot fundamentally solve the long-tail distribution problem of the training instances. In order to enable the neural network to learn new knowledge through few instances such as humans, this work focuses on few-shot relation classification (FSRC), where a classifier should generalize to new classes that have not been seen in the training set, given only a number of samples for each class. To make full use of the existing information and get a better feature representation for each instance, we propose to encode each class prototype in an adaptive way from two aspects. First, based on the prototypical networks, we propose an adaptive mixture mechanism to add label words to the representation of the class prototype, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to integrate the label information into features of the support samples of each class so as to get more interactive class prototypes. Second, to more reasonably measure the distances between samples of each category, we introduce a loss function for joint representation learning (JRL) to encode each support instance in an adaptive manner. Extensive experiments have been conducted on FewRel under different few-shot (FS) settings, and the results show that the proposed adaptive prototypical networks with label words and JRL has not only achieved significant improvements in accuracy but also increased the generalization ability of FSRC. © 2012 IEEE."
"How has the sentiment around the “responsibility to protect” (R2P) changed over time? Scholars have debated far and wide whether the political norm enjoys widespread discursive acceptance or is on the brink of decline. This article contends that we can use sentiment analysis as an important indicator for norm validity. My analysis provides three crucial insights. First, despite the well-known fear of some scholars, R2P is still frequently invoked in Security Council deliberations on issues of international peace and security. Second, overall levels of affirmative language have remained remarkably stable over time. This finding indicates that R2P is far from being obliterated. Out of 130 states, 4 international organizations (IOs), and 2 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) invoking the norm, 65% maintain a positive net-sentiment. Third, zooming into Libya as a case illustration of a critical juncture, we see some minor tonal shifts from some pivotal member states. Adding the fact that interest constellations within the Permanent Five are heterogeneous concerning the third pillar of R2P, future military interventions, sanctioned under the norm, seem unlikely. © The Author(s) 2022."
"To monitor students progress and adapt instruction to students needs, teachers increasingly use repeated assessments of equivalent tests. The present study investigates whether equivalent reading tests can be successfully developed via rule-based item design. Based on theoretical considerations, we identified 3-item features for reading comprehension at the word, sentence, and text levels, respectively, which should influence the difficulty and time intensity of reading processes. Using optimal design algorithms, a design matrix was calculated, and four equivalent test forms of the German reading test series for second graders (quop-L2) were developed. A total of N = 7,751 students completed the tests. We estimated item difficulty and time intensity parameters as well as person ability and speed parameters using bivariate item response theory (IRT) models, and we investigated the influence of item features on item parameters. Results indicate that all item properties significantly affected either item difficulty or response time. Moreover, as indicated by the IRT-based test information functions and analyses of variance, the four different test forms showed similar levels of difficulty and time-intensity at the word, sentence, and text levels (all n2 > .002). Results were successfully cross-validated using a sample of N = 5,654 students. © 2023 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH. All rights reserved."
"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led us to use virtual solutions and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI). Recent studies have clearly demonstrated the role of AI in health care and medical practice; however, a comprehensive review can identify potential yet not fulfilled functionalities of such technologies in pandemics. Therefore, this scoping review study aims at assessing AI functionalities in the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022. Methods: A systematic search was carried out in PubMed, Cochran Library, Scopus, Science Direct, ProQuest, and Web of Science from 2019 to May 9, 2022. Researchers selected the articles according to the search keywords. Finally, the articles mentioning the functionalities of AI in the COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated. Two investigators performed this process. Results: Initial search resulted in 9123 articles. After reviewing the title, abstract, and full text of these articles, and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 4 articles were selectd for the final analysis. All 4 were cross-sectional studies. Two studies (50%) were performed in the United States, 1 (25%) in Israel, and 1 (25%) in Saudi Arabia. They covered the functionalities of AI in the prediction, detection, and diagnosis of COVID-19. Conclusions: To the extent of the researchers' knowledge, this study is the first scoping review that assesses the AI functionalities in the COVID-19 pandemic. Health-care organizations need decision support technologies and evidence-based apparatuses that can perceive, think, and reason not dissimilar to human beings. Potential functionalities of such technologies can be used to predict mortality, detect, screen, and trace current and former patients, analyze health data, prioritize high-risk patients, and better allocate hospital resources in pandemics, and generally in health-care settings.  © 2023 The Author(s).

"Entity linking (EL) is the process of linking entity mentions appearing in web text with their corresponding entities in a knowledge base. EL plays an important role in the fields of knowledge engineering and data mining, underlying a variety of downstream applications such as knowledge base population, content analysis, relation extraction, and question answering. In recent years, deep learning (DL), which has achieved tremendous success in various domains, has also been leveraged in EL methods to surpass traditional machine learning based methods and yield the state-of-the-art performance. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis of existing DL based EL methods. First of all, we propose a new taxonomy, which organizes existing DL based EL methods using three axes: embedding, feature, and algorithm. Then we systematically survey the representative EL methods along the three axes of the taxonomy. Later, we introduce ten commonly used EL data sets and give a quantitative performance analysis of DL based EL methods over these data sets. Finally, we discuss the remaining limitations of existing methods and highlight some promising future directions.  © 1989-2012 IEEE."
"Introduction: Same-Sex Intimate Partner Violence (SSIPV) is a complex issue that can be severely damaging. When involved in SSIPV, victims and perpetrators sometimes choose to seek help. The help-seeking process, however, can be difficult. Experiences of help-seeking seem to vary and may be positive or negative depending on several factors, some of which appear to be specific to lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) people involved in a same-sex relationship. Methods: A systematic review of the literature has been conducted across four databases following the PRISMA statement guidelines. Out of 410 screened abstracts, 78 articles were selected for full-text review. Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 21 studies were included in the current review. Thematic analysis was conducted on these studies and results were discussed by three reviewers. Results: Help-seekers tended to use informal sources of help, perceived to be ambivalently helpful. Formal sources tended to be utilized sparingly, except for counselors. Many formal sources were perceived to be unhelpful, and most of the studies identified several barriers to services that prevented effective help. Formal and helpful sources were perceived as knowledgeable and sensitive about LGB themes. Conclusions: While existing research is limited, formal services that can provide effective care for SSIPV appear scarce. Barriers to services seem widespread, limiting accessibility. Policy Implications: Existing services would benefit from increasing their knowledge and sensitivity on SSIPV-specific themes. The development of policies, programs, and interventions that aim to provide effective help is needed, as well as more research. © 2021, The Author(s)."

"Automated recognition of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms from clinical texts is of significant interest to the field of clinical data mining. In this study, we develop a combined deep learning method named PhenoBERT for this purpose. PhenoBERT uses BERT, currently the state-of-The-Art NLP model, as its core model for evaluating whether a clinically relevant text segment (CTS) could be represented by an HPO term. However, to avoid unnecessary comparison of a CTS with each of ∼14,000 HPO terms using BERT, we introduce a two-levels CNN module consisting of a series of CNN models organized at two levels in PhenoBERT. For a given CTS, the CNN module produces only a short list of candidate HPO terms for BERT to evaluate, significantly improving the computational efficiency. In addition, BERT is able to assign an ancestor HPO term to a CTS when recognition of the direct HPO term is not successful, mimicking the process of HPO term assignment by human. In two benchmarks, PhenoBERT outperforms four traditional dictionary-based methods and two recently developed deep learning-based methods in two benchmark tests, and its advantage is more obvious when the recognition task is more challenging. As such, PhenoBERT is of great use for assisting in the mining of clinical text data.  © 2004-2012 IEEE."
"Although Hegel is increasingly recognized as an important figure in the history of political economy, his economic views are never strictly economic. In contrast to other modern thinkers, his primary concern is not the economic efficacy of different practices or institutions but the extent to which they enable and promote the development of human freedom. In this article, I argue that Hegel's pioneering critique of modern liberal economy plays out simultaneously at a more empirical level, corresponding to the properly economic dimension of his analysis, and at a deeper, logical level, which grounds and guides his position. Moreover, I argue that the tendency to favour the first of these levels, found in most of the literature on Hegel's economic thought, reduces the Philosophy of Right's main argument to a more or less vigorous plea for economic interventionism. Against this kind of reading, I show that a renewed focus on the text's logical structure reveals a different and more radical philosophical proposition, which has yet to be fully acknowledged. In particular, I argue that Hegel's dialectical logic leads him beyond the liberalism-interventionism debate, towards a qualitatively different conception of social and economic relations. © 2022 The Author.

"In this article, we address the questions: How is the purpose of higher education constructed within policy texts from the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), England and Sweden? How does this position students in making the transition from Bachelor to Masters? We do this through analysis of two recent policy documents from each of the EHEA, England and Sweden, identifying key discourses including the meanings, oppositions, contradictions and logics that structure the texts. We look at what aspects of ‘global policyspeak’ are common across them, what are their particularities and how these are shaped by distinct histories. We argue that all the texts represent neoliberal policies in sharing an economic rationale for higher education and in individualising the benefits of university education. Students are, in their transition from Bachelor to Masters, expected to maximise their employability and their ability to contribute to the national and global knowledge economy. However, there are also differences between the policy documents, tensions within them and alternative discourses, such as a focus on dialogue and academic freedom that challenge the reduction of higher education to the economic. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Compressed self-indexes are used widely in string processing applications, such as information retrieval, genome analysis, data mining, and web searching. The index not only indexes the data, but also encodes the data, and it is in compressed form. Moreover, the index and the data it encodes can be operated upon directly, without need to uncompress the entire index, thus saving time while maintaining small storage space. In some applications, such as in genome analysis, existing methods do not exploit the full possibilities of compressed self-indexes, and thus we seek faster and more space-efficient indexes. In this paper, we propose a practical high-order entropy-compressed self-index for efficient pattern matching in a text. We give practical implementations of compressed suffix arrays using a hybrid encoding in the representation of the neighbor function Φ. We analyze the performance in theory and practice of our recommended indexing method, called GeCSA. We can improve retrieval time further using an iterated version of the neighbor function. Experimental results on the tested data demonstrate that the proposed index GeCSA has good overall advantages in space usage and retrieval time over the state-of-the-art indexing methods, especially on the repetitive data.  © 1989-2012 IEEE."
"With the development of COVID-19 and technology, interest in metaverse has increased. Also, the market for metaverse, especially regarding children as major service users, is growing. However, related studies are lacking comparing the perceptions among major stakeholders, and there is also a lack of metaverse research on parents. The purpose of this study is to examine the comprehensive perception of child-related metaverse by text mining of news articles that could understand the discussions of service providers and parent communities that could understand the discussions of service users. Each of the nine topics were derived, and common and distinct issues were examined. This study provides policy and strategic implications for the child-related metaverse industry. © 2023 ACM."
"The current router security issues focus on the mining and utilization of memory-type vulnerabilities, but there is low interest in detecting backdoors. Hard-coded backdoor is one of the most common backdoors, which is simple and convenient to set up and can be implemented with only a small amount of code. However, it is difficult to be discovered and often causes serious safety hazard and economic loss. The triggering process of hard-coded backdoor is inseparable from string comparison functions. Therefore, the detection of hard-coded backdoors relies on string comparison functions, which are mainly divided into static analysis method and symbolic execution method. The former has a high degree of automation, but has a high false positive rate and poor detection results. The latter has a high accuracy rate, but cannot automate large-scale detection of firmware, and faces the problem of path explosion or even unable to constrain solution. Aiming at the above problems, a hard-coded backdoor detection algorithm based on string text semantic conflict (Stect) was proposed since static analysis and the think of stain analysis. Stect started from the commonly used string comparison functions, combined with the characteristics of MIPS and ARM architectures, and extracted a set of paths with the same start and end nodes using function call relationships, control flow graphs, and branching selection dependent strings. If the strings in the successfully verified set of paths have semantic conflict, it means that there is a hard-coded backdoor in the router firmware. In order to evaluate the detection effect of Stect, 1 074 collected device images were tested and compared with other backdoor detection methods. Experimental results show that Stect has a better detection effect compared with existing backdoor detection methods including Costin and Stringer: 8 hard-coded backdoor images detected from image data set, and the recall rate reached 88.89%. © 2023, Beijing Xintong Media Co., Ltd..

"The work of the French illustrator and writer Gilles Bachelet has been recognised through numerous awards, but he is not yet sufficiently well known in the critical community. In this article, the multilevel humour that constructs his work is studied, both from an iconic and a textual perspective, as well as the situational humour and the humour of characters that emerge through metafiction, self-referentiality and heteroreferentiality. For this purpose, the theories of humour in children’s literature and the classifications of types of humour offered by different researchers are used as a starting point, and a mixed model of analysis applicable to Bachelet’s work as a whole is proposed. In addition, the analysis of each of the picturebooks is based on the most recent studies on the components of the current picturebook, such as its narrative construction, type of reading, characteristics and organisation of text and image. In this way, the postmodern features of Gilles Bachelet's works, which make him a crossover author, are revealed. © 2021, The Author(s)."
"Introduction: Spinal infusions of either fentanyl or sufentanil have been reported in international reports, articles, and scientific events worldwide. This study aimed to determine whether intrathecal fentanyl or sufentanil offers safety in mortality and perioperative adverse events. Methods: MEDLINE (via PubMed), EMBASE, CENTRAL (Cochrane library databases), gray literature, hand-searching, and clinicaltrials.gov were systematically searched. Randomized controlled trials with no language, data, or status restrictions were included, comparing the effectiveness and safety of adding spinal lipophilic opioid to local anesthetics (LAs). Data were pooled using the random-effects models or fixed-effect models based on heterogeneity. Results: The initial search retrieved 4469 records; 3241 records were eligible, and 3152 articles were excluded after reading titles and abstracts, with a high agreement rate (98.6%). After reading the full texts, 76 articles remained. Spinal fentanyl and sufentanil significantly reduced postoperative pain and opioid consumption, increased analgesia and pruritus. Fentanyl, but not sufentanil, significantly reduced both postoperative nausea and vomiting, and postoperative shivering; compared to LAs alone. The analyzed studies did not report any case of in-hospital mortality related to spinal lipophilic opioids. The rate of respiratory depression was 0.7% and 0.8% when spinal fentanyl or sufentanil was added and when it was not, respectively. Episodes of respiratory depression were rare, uneventful, occurred intraoperatively, and were easily manageable. Conclusion: There is moderate to high quality certainty that there is evidence regarding the safety and effectiveness of adding lipophilic opioids to LAs in spinal anesthesia. © 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia"
"Recent research has produced efficient algorithms based on deep learning for text-based analytics. Such architectures could be readily applied to text-based social media content analysis. The deep learning techniques, which require comparatively fewer resources for language modeling, can be effectively used to process social media content data that change regularly. Convolutional Neural networks and recurrent neural networks based approaches have reported prominent performance in this domain, yet their limitations make them sub-optimal. Capsule networks sufficiently warrant their applicability in language modelling tasks as a promising technique beyond their initial usage of image classification. This study proposes an approach based on capsule networks for social media content analysis, especially for Twitter. We empirically show that our approach is optimal even without the use of any linguistic resources. The proposed architectures produced an accuracy of 86.87% for the Twitter Sentiment Gold dataset and an accuracy of 82.04% for the CrowdFlower US Airline dataset, indicating state-of-the-art performance. Hence, the research findings indicate noteworthy accuracy enhancement for text processing within social media content analysis. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"To understand the audience's subjective perception of quality of service (QoS), it is important to analyze the data acquired from the logistics service logs and online evaluation system reasonably and effectively. Based on the analysis, rational improvement measures and decision suggestions can be developed to enhance the QoS. However, modern logistics service departments often face various business needs and service objects at the same time. If the evaluation subjects and their relationships are unclear in the service evaluation data, the sentiment analysis result of the text is a coarse-grained evaluation of the service as a whole. The lack of fine-grained pertinent evaluation results will hinder the improvement of specific management measures. To solve the problem, this paper designs an attention-based long short-term memory network (AT-LSTM) to divide the service reviews into ten topic relations, and then builds a deeper attention LSTM with aspect embedding (AE-DATT-LSTM). The weight-sharing bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) trains the topic word vectors and the text word vectors, and fuses the resulting topic features and text features. After the processing of the deep attention mechanism, the sentiment class of each evaluation topic is obtained by the classifier. Finally, several experiments were carried out on different public datasets. The results show that our approach surpasses the previous attention-based sentiment analysis models in accuracy and stability of service quality sentiment analysis. The introduction of topic features and deep attention mechanism is of great significance for the QoS-based sentiment classification b, and provides a feasible method for other fields like public opinion analysis, question answering system, and text reasoning. © 2023, Strojarski Facultet.

"The true crime genre has become synonymous with the serial killer. As such, other narratives dealing with different types of violent criminal subjects have been overlooked in academic and media analyses. The following article explores a subgenre of true crime which has been overlooked—the life story of the violent criminal or “hardman biography.” However, in acknowledging the hardman, the discussion also reveals his presence across fact/fiction boundaries and a range of cultural terrain. Following a discussion of the cultural space this figure occupies, I turn my attention to hardman stories which exist predominantly in the local imaginary and focus on one such text which tells the story of a violent protagonist and cultures of crime and violence in the North of England in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In so doing, I focus on how this text animates cultures of violence and marginality left in the wake of deindustrialization and economic decline, combining this with relevant theoretical and ethnographic work. I conclude by arguing that the text is a further example of the way in which popular criminology can complement and advance academic criminological understandings of crime and violence. © The Author(s) 2021."
"Purpose: This study aims to investigate the drivers of successful equity crowdfunding campaigns in Malaysia. Design/methodology/approach: Data for this study are collected manually from 5 different equity crowdfunding platforms in Malaysia. A total of 101 campaigns are analyzed, out of which the final sample used for this study is 97. The relationships are analyzed via ordinary least squares multiple regression analysis. Findings: The results of the analysis show that minimum funding target, minimum investment required, pre-money valuation and length of pitch video are highly significant in influencing the success of the campaign. Percentage of equity retained is only significant at the 10% level. The size of the project team and the text length of the pitch are found to be insignificant. In addition, all the variables, except for equity retained and the minimum investment required, are found to have a positive impact on the success of an equity crowdfunding campaign in Malaysia. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the success factors of equity crowdfunding campaigns in a developing country such as Malaysia. In addition, this study contributes to the literature on equity crowdfunding success via the inclusion of less-studied variables such as pre-money valuation and minimum investment required. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Purpose: The ongoing impact of COVID-19 and the subsequent perception of threat have shifted consumer perceptions and evaluations of service experiences. This paper aims to investigate how customers’ service evaluation is shared as customer reviews following the pandemic and the heightened perception of threat. In doing so, this research particularly investigates the shifts in the textual contents of online reviews. Design/methodology/approach: This study used the textual contents in the online reviews posted on Hotels.com for 1,497 hotels in New York City for empirical analysis. In total, 109,190 observations were used for the analysis. Findings: By analyzing actual online review data from an online review platform for hotel services, this study finds that the text reviews generated after the pandemic outbreak tend to contain words with stronger negative emotions. In terms of the pronoun choice, this study further finds that the use of “I” increases while the use of “we” decreases. Originality/value: This research adds to the existing literature on service evaluation and online customer reviews by showing that there are shifts in the expressions used to communicate service evaluation through online text reviews, including the degree of emotionality and pronoun usage. Because potential customers are likely to rely on online reviews for their own decisions, the findings suggest that it is important for practitioners to be aware of such shifts and respond accordingly. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Introduction Asymmetric mandibular hypoplasia, microtia, tongue and laryngeal anomalies, and soft palate and facial nerve dysfunction are clinical features observed in children with craniofacial microsomia (CFM). Despite involvement of all these structures in hearing and speech, there is limited evidence reporting speech outcomes in this population. Systematic reviews of clinical and surgical interventions related to CFM have been published, but no methodological review of speech outcomes exists. This scoping review will summarise what is known about speech production in individuals with CFM as well as illustrate gaps in the existing body of literature that will guide future research. Methods/analysis This review will follow the methodological framework for scoping reviews first reported by Arksey & O'Malley and revised by Levac and others. Databases searched will include Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and grey literature. Articles reporting any parameter of speech production in individuals with CFM will be considered for inclusion. Articles published in a language other than English will be excluded. Articles will be screened in three stages: (1) title review, (2) abstract review and (3) full text review. Ten per cent of articles will be rescreened by a second reviewer. Reference lists will be hand reviewed to identify additional relevant articles. Data charting will capture article metadata, study population and design, CFM diagnostic criteria, speech outcome measurement and key findings. The Preferred Reporting Systems for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols-Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist will guide reporting of results. Descriptive analysis and data visualisation strategies will be used. Ethics and dissemination Institutional review board approval is not required for a scoping review, as it does not directly involve human subjects. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication as well as conference presentation.  © 2023 Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

"The core difficulty of text-based person search is how to achieve fine-grained alignment of visual and linguistic modal data, so as to bridge the gap of modal heterogeneity. Most existing works on this task focus on global and local features extraction and matching, ignoring the importance of relational information. This paper proposes a new text-based person search model, named CM-LRGNet, which extracts Cross-Modal Local-Relational-Global features in an end-to-end manner, and performs fine-grained cross-modal alignment on the above three feature levels. Concretely, we first split the convolutional feature maps to obtain local features of images, and adaptively extract textual local features. Then a relation encoding module is proposed to implicitly learn the relational information implied in the images and texts. Finally, a relation-aware graph attention network is designed to fuse the local and relational features to generate global representations for both images and text queries. Extensive experimental results on benchmark dataset (CUHK-PEDES) show that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance (64.18%, 82.97%, 89.85% in terms of Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10 accuracies), by learning and aligning local-relational-global representations from different modalities.

"Introduction: Due to conflicts of national identity and religion, human rights legislation has been integral to Northern Ireland’s post-war journey. As a result of this, the post-conflict generation of girls, female adolescents, and non-heterosexual, queer-identifying peoples have more rights, opportunities, and recognition in educational policy than generations prior. However, government reports show issues within the country’s Relationships and Sexuality Education (RSE) curricula, including that only one in five Northern Irish schools have touched upon lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) topics. Methods: This paper presents the first feminist post-structuralist analysis focusing on gender and sexual inequalities within the current national policy framework (as of September 2021) informing school-based RSE. Applying feminist critical discourse and content analysis to examine official government circulars, legislative text, and RSE policy guidance distributed to schools, feminist lenses are drawn on to examine four main sets of issues: bodies, sexual agency and pleasure, the inclusion of gender and sexual diversity, and heteronormativity. Results: Findings show that despite human rights legislation and having statutory RSE with legislated content, central discourses within the national RSE policy framework impose a story of female victimization, problematize binary constructions of gender, participate in the erasure of non-binary identifying persons, and prioritize compulsory heteronormativity. Conclusions: Until inclusive, non-binary language and standardized content is prescribed within the minimum content found in legislation and deemed statutory by the Department of Education, young people will not receive uniform RSE, undermining the importance of gender and sexual inclusivity and diversity. Policy Implications: Discourses illuminated within this paper may be drawn on by international policy actors and researchers to elucidate taken-for-granted or problematic language found within their own policies so that the rights of marginalized bodies and sexual identities are instilled and those who have been victimized may find empowerment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Genetics is the clinical review of congenital mutation, where the principal advantage of analyzing genetic mutation of humans is the exploration, analysis, interpretation and description of the genetic transmitted and inherited effect of several diseases such as cancer, diabetes and heart diseases. Cancer is the most troublesome and disordered affliction as the proportion of cancer sufferers is growing massively. Identification and discrimination of the mutations that impart to the enlargement of tumor from the unbiased mutations is difficult, as majority tumors of cancer are able to exercise genetic mutations. The genetic mutations are systematized and categorized to sort the cancer by way of medical observations and considering clinical studies. At the present time, genetic mutations are being annotated and these interpretations are being accomplished either manually or using the existing primary algorithms. Evaluation and classification of each and every individual genetic mutation was basically predicated on evidence from documented content built on medical literature. Consequently, as a means to build genetic mutations, basically, depending on the clinical evidences persists a challenging task. There exist various algorithms such as one hot encoding technique is used to derive features from genes and their variations, TF-IDF is used to extract features from the clinical text data. In order to increase the accuracy of the classification, machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, etc., are experimented. A stacking model classifier has been developed to increase the accuracy. The proposed stacking model classifier has obtained the log loss 0.8436 and 0.8572 for cross-validation data set and test data set, respectively. By the experimentation, it has been proved that the proposed stacking model classifier outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of log loss. Basically, minimum log loss refers to the efficient model. Here the log loss has been reduced to less than 1 by using the proposed stacking model classifier. The performance of these algorithms can be gauged on the basis of the various measures like multi-class log loss.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company."
"This paper proposes a multi-modal approach for speech emotion recognition (SER) using both text and audio inputs. The audio embedding is extracted by using a vision-based architecture, namely VGGish, while the text embedding is extracted by using a transformer-based architecture, namely BERT. Then, these embeddings are fused using concatenation to recognize emotional states. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, the benchmark dataset, namely IEMOCAP, is employed in this study. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is very competitive and better than most of the latest and state-of-the-art methods using multi-modal analysis for SER. The proposed method achieves 63.00% unweighted accuracy (UA) and 63.10% weighted accuracy (WA) on the IEMOCAP dataset. In the future, an extension of multi-task learning and multi-lingual approaches will be investigated to improve the performance and robustness of multi-modal SER.

"Can International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending improve natural resource governance in borrowing countries? While most IMF agreements mandate policy reforms in exchange for financial support, compliance with these reforms is mixed at best. The natural resource sector should be no exception. After all, resource windfalls enable short-term increases in discretionary spending, and office-seeking politicians are often unwilling to forgo this discretion by reforming the oil, gas, or mining sector. I investigate how and when borrowers go against their political interests and establish natural resource funds—a tool often promoted by the IMF—in the wake of a loan agreement. Using text analysis, statistical models, and qualitative evidence from natural resource policy and IMF conditionality for 74 countries between 1980 and 2019, I show that borrowers under an IMF agreement are more likely to create or regulate a resource fund, particularly if the agreement includes binding conditions that highlight the salience of natural resource reforms. This study contributes to extant research by proposing a new method to extract information from IMF conditions, by introducing a novel dataset on country-level natural resource policy, and by identifying under what circumstances international reform efforts can help combat the resource curse. © 2022 The Authors.

"Are conservatives more simple-minded and happier than liberals? To revisit this question, 1,518 demographically diverse participants (52% females) were recruited from an online participant-sourcing platform and asked to write a narrative about the upcoming 2020 U.S. Presidential Election as well as complete self and candidates’ ratings of personality. The narratives were analyzed using three well-validated text analysis programs. As expected, extremely enthusiastic Trump supporters used less cognitively complex and more confident language than both their less enthusiastic counterparts and Biden supporters. Trump supporters also used more positive affective language than Biden supporters. More simplistic and categorical modes of thinking as well as positive emotional tone were also associated with positive perceptions of Trump’s, but not Biden’s personality. Dialectical complexity and positive emotional tone accounted for significant unique variance in predicting appraisals of Trump’s trustworthiness/integrity even after controlling for demographic variables, self-ratings of conscientiousness and openness, and political affiliation. © The Author(s) 2022."
"In modern theoretical and applied mechanics, tensors and differential geometry are two almost essential tools. Unfortunately, in university courses for engineering and mechanics students, these topics are often poorly treated or even completely ignored. At the same time, many existing, very complete texts on tensors or differential geometry are so advanced and written in abstract language that discourage young readers looking for an introduction to these topics specifically oriented to engineering applications. This textbook, mainly addressed to graduate students and young researchers in mechanics, is an attempt to fill the gap. Its aim is to introduce the reader to the modern mathematical tools and language of tensors, with special applications to the differential geometry of curves and surfaces in the Euclidean space. The exposition of the matter is sober, directly oriented to problems that are ordinarily found in mechanics and engineering. Also, the language and symbols are tailored to those usually employed in modern texts of continuum mechanics. Though not exhaustive, as any primer textbook, this volume constitutes a coherent, self-contained introduction to the mathematical tools and results necessary in modern continuum mechanics, concerning vectors, 2nd- and 4th-rank tensors, curves, fields, curvilinear coordinates, and surfaces in the Euclidean space. More than 100 exercises are proposed to the reader, many of them complete the theoretical part through additional results and proofs. To accompany the reader in learning, all the exercises are entirely developed and solved at the end of the book. © 2023 by World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Scholars interested in substantive representation for women have primarily focused on whether women vote for and prioritize “women’s issue” legislation. It is now well established that female lawmakers do vote for and introduce bills on issues like reproductive rights, childcare, and women’s health at rates higher than men. With this finding widely accepted, scholars have more recently investigated levels of female involvement on a wider range of topics and find that women are just as active as men—sometimes even more active—on an array of policy topics other than “women’s issues.” Several studies show women are more active sponsors of defense-related bills than are their male colleagues. We provide a case study that investigates whether female lawmakers offer distinct perspectives on these topics. We use structural topic modeling to explore sex and party differences in floor speeches delivered in the House of Representatives. Our analysis of these floor speeches given in the 109th Congress reveals that women and men do focus their attention on distinct facets of defense issues—focusing on the implications of war for women, civilians, and communities—and that these differences are conditioned by party. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Objective: To evaluate the existing evidence of a machine learning-based classification system that stratifies patients with stroke. Methods: The authors carried out a systematic review following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations for a review article. PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, and CINAHL Plus Full Text were searched from January 2015 to February 2021. Results: There are twelve studies included in this systematic review. Fifteen algorithms were used in the included studies. The most common forms of machine learning (ML) used to classify stroke patients were the support vector machine (SVM) (n = 8 studies), followed by random forest (RF) (n = 7 studies), decision tree (DT) (n = 4 studies), gradient boosting (GB) (n = 4 studies), neural networks (NNs) (n = 3 studies), deep learning (n = 2 studies), and k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) (n = 2 studies), respectively. Forty-four features of inputs were used in the included studies, and age and gender are the most common features in the ML model. Discussion: There is no single algorithm that performed better or worse than all others at classifying patients with stroke, in part because different input data require different algorithms to achieve optimal outcomes. © The Author(s) 2021."
"Efficient recognition of emotions has attracted extensive research interest, which makes new applications in many fields possible, such as human-computer interaction, disease diagnosis, service robots, and so forth. Although existing work on sentiment analysis relying on sensors or unimodal methods performs well for simple contexts like business recommendation and facial expression recognition, it does far below expectations for complex scenes, such as sarcasm, disdain, and metaphors. In this article, we propose a novel two-stage multimodal learning framework, called AMSA, to adaptively learn correlation and complementarity between modalities for dynamic fusion, achieving more stable and precise sentiment analysis results. Specifically, a multiscale attention model with a slice positioning scheme is proposed to get stable quintuplets of sentiment in images, texts, and speeches in the first stage. Then a Transformer-based self-adaptive network is proposed to assign weights flexibly for multimodal fusion in the second stage and update the parameters of the loss function through compensation iteration. To quickly locate key areas for efficient affective computing, a patch-based selection scheme is proposed to iteratively remove redundant information through a novel loss function before fusion. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both machine weakly labeled and manually annotated datasets of self-made Video-SA, CMU-MOSEI, and CMU-MOSI. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach through comparison with baselines. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery."
"The main objective of this research paper is to overcome the issue of imbalances in data and achieve an improved outcome for grouping by using synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE). The imbalanced issue with the dataset causes classification efficiency loss in many applications of data mining comprising of pattern detection, document categorization, and knowledge filtering activities. A sampling-based algorithm SMOTE is used herein to boost the efficiency of emotion classification that over-samples minority class instances to amount of majority class instances. YouTube © dataset was optimized using the SMOTE methodology and evaluated by the use of 3 machine learning algorithms, including decision tree (DT), multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB), and support vector machines (SVM). As a consequence, SVM reaches full specificity with 92.20 percent filtering function and 88.33 percent filtering process classification. The oversampling solution, however, might not be successful because it merely replicates minority class instances without any additional details. A way to create a set of instances comparable to those in the minority class with high potential to identify with the minority class was proposed in order to address this issue, and use them instead in the oversampling phase.

"The analysis of data provided by tourism platforms through Web 2.0 opens new ways to investigate how to improve trip experiences from a destination management organization's (DMO) perspective. This case study builds on Tripadvisor users' generated content to analyse the lodging experience and overall rating by around 70,000 hotel visitors in the city of Barcelona. The online reviews are processed using text mining and depuration techniques. The overall rating of the hotel stay is then explained by a set of covariates, mostly including locational and services rates' perception (room quality, cleanliness, room service, etc.) by means of a regression analysis using an ordered probit model. Through the case, we will learn to: (i) prepare the data set for the experiment; and (ii) run the model and discuss the main findings. © CAB International 2023. All rights reserved."
"Recommendation system can provide recommendations to consumers on which restaurants might be liked by these consumers. This method plays the major role in food industries. The approach taken is to use collaborative filtering for the final touch in providing restaurant recommendations, but before this stage, it will go through several stages, including Natural Language Processing (NLP) aiming to create a new scoring which is the result of sentiment analysis combined with previous ratings (review text content). Then, clustering will be carried out on customers, to accelerate and optimize the recommendation process. From these two approaches, collaborative filtering is then carried out, so that it can provide some recommendations that are most suitable for consumers. However, in the recommendation system, there is a problem called the Cold Start Problem, this is a condition where the consumer is new so we cannot give recommendations. To overcome this problem, Location Based Filtering will be used, in this method, the consumer must fill in the location where he is located, so that we can provide recommendations for the best restaurant close to the location where the consumer is located. To measure model performance Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is used, the results obtained for the RMSE of the proposed method are 0.55, better than the baseline RMSE at 0.62. The time needed to provide recommendations on the proposed method is 247 ms, faster than the baseline model with a speed of 1.83 s. To overcome the Cold-Start Problem, Location Based Filtering is used, in this method the consumer must fill in the location where he is, so that he can provide the best restaurant recommendations that are close to the location where the consumer is. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific.

"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to review literature concerning voice disorders in school-aged children. Study Design: Integrative review. Materials and Methods: A database search was conducted using PubMed, Web of Science, Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Complete, and Medline. All records included in this review were peer-reviewed journal articles that discussed voice disorders in children, conducted in the United States or Canada, written in English, and published between 2009 and 2019. Results: Database searching identified 1,771 records and 551 duplicates were removed. A total of 1,220 records were screened and 949 records were excluded. Two hundred and seventy-one full-text records were screened and 12 records met inclusion criteria. Vocal fold nodules were the most commonly reported vocal fold pathology. The Consensus Auditory Perceptual Evaluation of Voice and endoscopy were the most commonly reported assessments. However, variations in practice patterns and access to voice services may exist. Conclusions: The findings highlight that school-aged children may face barriers in accessing voice services. As a result, continued analyses of the potential barriers that hinder identification and treatment of voice disorders in this population appear warranted. © 2020 The Voice Foundation"
"The author of the article presents the methodology of discourse analysis, studies the structural elements of discourse, and analyses the possibilities of using discourse analysis in confessional studies. It has been determined that discourse analysis is a qualitative tool based on an interdisciplinary strategy that allows revealing the hidden meaning embedded in narrative sources and its manifestation in the process of implementing social relations. The article presents different approaches and methods of discourse analysis, which depend on the approach of the researcher, while noting that, within the framework of a specific historical study, discourse analysis always includes the main provisions of the critical discourse analysis methodology and it is aimed at studying the integral components of discourse: subject – activity – text – environment. As methodological principles of discourse analysis, the article highlights the problematisation and evaluation of discourse as a dialogic communicative act, involving the complex interaction of actors in a specific historical, political, socio-economic and cultural context, implemented in a specific narrative. Discourse analysis is built on an interdisciplinary strategy, which involves the use of theory, techniques and methods of various sciences (culturology, rhetoric, philosophy, psychology, political science, sociology, etc.) to identify the relationship between social, cultural, political and social processes, affecting the essence of discourse. Features of the practical application of discourse analysis in the study of confessional history are illus-trated by the author on the example of the analysis of the discourse of state policy in relation to the Еvangelical movements of Western Belarus in 1921–1939. The main constituent elements of the discourse were subjected to discourse analysis using the methods of formal logic, the historical-genetic method, legal, sociological and other methods, which made it possible to draw conclusions about the external and internal factors of the state confessional policy, to determine its characteristic features and to reveal the latent meaning of the discourse of the state policy regarding the Еvangelical movements of Western Belarus. As a result of testing, the effectiveness of using discourse analysis for the comprehensive study of the subject of confessional history research was confirmed. © 2023, The Belarusian State University.

"Software testing is still a manual process in many industries, despite the recent improvements in automated testing techniques. As a result, test cases (which consist of one or more test steps that need to be executed manually by the tester) are often specified in natural language by different employees and many redundant test cases might exist in the test suite. This increases the (already high) cost of test execution. Manually identifying similar test cases is a time-consuming and error-prone task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to identify similar test cases. Our approach uses a combination of text embedding, text similarity and clustering techniques to identify similar test cases. We evaluate five different text embedding techniques, two text similarity metrics, and two clustering techniques to cluster similar test steps and three techniques to identify similar test cases from the test step clusters. Through an evaluation in an industrial setting, we showed that our approach achieves a high performance to cluster test steps (an F-score of 87.39%) and identify similar test cases (an F-score of 86.13%). Furthermore, a validation with developers indicates several different practical usages of our approach (such as identifying redundant test cases), which help to reduce the testing manual effort and time.  © 2022 IEEE."
"Background: The school-based food and nutrition guidelines approach has the potential to combat undernutrition, overnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies among children and adolescents and set the foundation for a healthy adult lifestyle. Aim: To critically compare the Nutrition Friendly School Initiative (NFSI) of the World Health Organization (WHO) with the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) and the Indian Academy of Pediatrics (IAP) guidelines to gauge the strengths and limitations. Additionally, to summarize the existing studies on implementing school food and nutrition guidelines. Methods: Policy documents of the above guidelines were critically evaluated, and narrative analysis was conducted. An electronic search was conducted for full-text research articles published in the English language between January 2007 to September 2021 in Science Direct, PubMed, Web of Science, and SCOPUS databases. Results: Upon critical comparison of the three guidelines, it was found that the NFSI and FSSAI guidelines shared similarities in many components and the FSSAI guidelines, if implemented adequately, could improve the school food environment and combat the triple malnutrition burden in India. After screening the articles based on the eligibility criteria, 11 studies were included in the preparation of the review. Studies reported partial or inadequate implementation and poor compliance with the guidelines or approach. A few studies identified barriers to guideline implementation. Conclusion: Implementation of school food and nutrition guidelines could improve the nutritional outcomes in children and adolescents. To sustain the effective implementation, adequate resources and preparedness are essential in low-and middle-income countries, including India. © The Author(s) 2022."
"In the past couple of years, location-sensitive information retrieval has gained significant attention in terms of extracting and utilizing location information present in the unstructured text. It requires analysis of documents both geographically and thematically that makes it a challenging task. The semantics of text needs to be associated with location features present in the text. Such information association is beneficial in conducting fine-grained analysis of events reported in the text, e.g., Tourist location recommendation, Disaster surveillance, Political activeness and Happiness index, etc. Recently, context-based vector space models have attained much importance in text mining as they intelligently preserve semantics of the text while representing text in vector space of desired dimension. In this paper, a framework for multiclass supervised classification of location-sensitive events, namely, LDoc2Vec is proposed that integrates context-based vector space models with geographic scope resolution of events reported in the text documents. Variants of the Doc2Vec model have been integrated with location features and their performance for multiclass supervised event classification is analysed. Experimental results with various machine learning classifiers indicate that the proposed framework outperforms baseline Doc2Vec models for multiclass classification of location-sensitive events as expressed by renowned performance measurement metrics viz. precision, recall and F1-score. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Background: The copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) is a highly effective method of contraception that can also be used for emergency contraception (EC). It is the most effective form of EC, and is more effective than other existing oral regimens also used for EC. The Cu-IUD provides the unique benefit of providing ongoing contraception after it is inserted for EC; however, uptake of this intervention has been limited. Progestin IUDs are a popular method of long-acting, reversible contraception. If these devices were also found to be effective for EC, they would provide a critical additional option for women. These IUDs could not only provide EC and ongoing contraception, but additional non-contraceptive benefits, including a reduction in menstrual bleeding, cancer prevention, and pain management. Objectives: To examine the safety and effectiveness of progestin-containing IUDs for emergency contraception, compared with copper-containing IUDs, or compared with dedicated oral hormonal methods. Search methods: We considered all randomized controlled trials and non-randomized studies of interventions that compared outcomes for individuals seeking a levonorgestrel IUD (LNG-IUD) for EC to a Cu-IUD or dedicated oral EC method. We considered full-text studies, conference abstracts, and unpublished data. We considered studies irrespective of their publication status and language of publication. Selection criteria: We included studies comparing progestin IUDs with copper-containing IUDs, or oral EC methods for emergency contraception. Data collection and analysis: We systematically searched nine medical databases, two trials registries, and one gray literature site. We downloaded all titles and abstracts retrieved by electronic searching to a reference management database, and removed duplicates. Three review authors independently screened titles, abstracts, and full-text reports to determine studies eligible for inclusion. We followed standard Cochrane methodology to assess risk of bias, and analyze and interpret the data. We used GRADE methodology to assess the certainty of the evidence. Main results: We included only one relevant study (711 women); a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial comparing LNG-IUDs to Cu-IUDs for EC, with a one-month follow-up. With one study, the evidence was very uncertain for the difference in pregnancy rates, failed insertion rates, expulsion rates, removal rates and the difference in the acceptability of the IUDs. There was also uncertain evidence suggesting the Cu-IUD may slightly increase rates of cramping and the LNG-IUD may slightly increase bleeding and spotting days. Authors' conclusions: This review is limited in its ability to provide definitive evidence regarding the LNG-IUD’s equivalence, superiority, or inferiority to the Cu-IUD for EC. Only one study was identified in the review, which had possible risks of bias related to randomization and rare outcomes. Additional studies are needed to provide definitive evidence related to the effectiveness of the LNG-IUD for EC. Copyright © 2023 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Study Design: Systematic Review. Objective: To collect and group definitions of segmental instability, reported in surgical studies of patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) and/or lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (LDS). To report the frequencies of these definitions. To report on imaging measurement thresholds for instability in patients and compare these to those reported in biomechanical studies and studies of spine healthy individuals.To report on studies that include a reliability study. Methods: This review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies eligible for inclusion were clinical and biomechanical studies on adult patients with LDS and/or LSS who underwent surgical treatment and had data on diagnostic imaging. A systematic literature search was conducted in relevant literature databases. Full text screening inclusion criteria was definition of segmental instability or any synonym. Two reviewers independently screened articles in a two-step process. Data synthesis presented by tabulate form and narrative synthesis. Results: We included 118 studies for data extraction, 69% were surgical studies with decompression or fusion as interventions, 31% non-interventional studies. Grouping the definitions of segmental instability according similarities showed that 24% defined instability by dynamic sagittal translation, 26% dynamic translation and dynamic angulation, 8% used a narrative definition. Comparison showed that non-interventional studies with a healthy population more often had a narrative definition. Conclusion: Despite a reputation of non-consensus, segmental instability in the degenerative lumbar spine can radiologically be defined as > 3 mm dynamic sagittal translation. © The Author(s) 2022."
"The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of the existing qualitative research concerning the lived experiences of children and young people currently in foster care. Introduction Lived experience of foster care is an area of limited research. Studies tend to focus on foster caregiver retention rates, education performance outcomes, evaluations and policy development. Although these studies are important, they provide little insight into the everyday lives of those currently in foster care, which is likely to influence these previous areas of research. Methods and analysis The scoping review will be guided by Arksey and O'Malley's approach to scoping studies. A systematic database search of PubMed, CINAHL and PsycINFO will be conducted followed by a systematic chain search of referenced and referencing literature. English-language peer-reviewed qualitative studies of children and young people currently in foster care will be included. We will exclude studies linked to transitioning out of foster care and studies with samples mixed with other types of out-of-home care. Mixed-methods studies will be excluded in addition to programme, treatment or policy evaluations. Following removal of duplicates, titles and abstracts will be screened, followed by a full-text review. Two researchers will independently screen references against inclusion and exclusion criteria using Covidence software. The quality of the included studies will be assessed by two independent reviewers using the appropriate Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. Ethics and dissemination Information gathered in this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences relevant to foster care services and quality improvement. Reports will be disseminated to relevant foster care agencies, where relevant. Ethical approval and informed consent are not required as this protocol is a review of existing literature. Findings from the included studies will be charted and summarised thematically in a separate manuscript.  © 2023 Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

"In this work we analyze the lyrics of one of the most famous and influential Arab artists in the twentieth century, namely, (Abdel ElHalim Hafez). Lyrics analysis provides a deep insight into the artist's career evolution and his interactions with the surrounding environment including the social, political, and economic conditions. In order to perform such analysis we had to collect and compile the lyrics of Abdel ElHalim accompanied with the necessary metadata into an organized and structured form. The data are preprocessed by removing stop words and doing some normalization operations over the songs' prose. We did not perform any lemmatization or stemming as the original form of the tokens convey much more information than the source words. We performed a lexical analysis in order to study both the lexical density and diversity over the course of Abdel ElHalim's career life. We have as well studied the most significant words, idioms, and terms played in the songs using tools such as word clouds and more quantitative measures such as term frequency-inverse document frequency. We have divided the career life of Abdel ElHalim into sub-decades of length 5 years and all analyses are done both in a yearly fashion and more coarsely over such sub-decades. We have found a strong correlation between our statistical analysis and the socio-political status in Egypt and the Arab world during that time. This is especially relevant knowing that Abdel ElHalim is very much truly considered the son of the generation of the 1952 revolution in Egypt. The significance of Abdel ElHalim and his lyrics stem essentially from being contemporaneous to radical changes in Egypt across all sectors including political (support of liberation movements across the world, and the conflict with Israel), and socio-economic (especially changing the social class structure in Egypt). We also investigated the potential effectiveness of PoS (Part of Speech) tagging in genre analysis and classification.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery."
"Background: Caregivers of elderly people need the right education and empowering skills to manage their own health needs and the elderly people they care for. Objective: The study aimed to explore youth perceptions of the My-Elderly-Care-Skills Module intervention and its perceived feasibility. Methods: This study involved youth respondents (18–30 years old) from low-income households who are accountable to providing care for independent older people (60 years or above) living in the same house. A qualitative study using a case study design was used to assess youth perceptions based on the content of the My-Elderly-Care-Skills module, by focusing on its implementation usage and usefulness for the care of the elderly. A total of 30 youths voluntarily participated in the online training workshop during the COVID-19 pandemic movement restriction order period. There were multiple sources of data, such as video recorded on reflection of care given at home, text messages in a WhatsApp group, and in-depth interviews during small group online meetings. Data were recorded and transcribed verbatim for common themes before a theme analysis was conducted. Inductive content analysis was performed after the saturation point was met. Results: Thematic analysis derived two domains of feasibility: operational and technical feasibility. There were three themes under operational practicality (improving awareness, addressing the caregiving skills needs, and seeking resources for knowledge) and three themes for technical practicality (easily used and informative, skill in effective communication, and program fulfillment). Conclusion: It was verified that it is feasible for young caregivers of the elderly to participate in the My-Elderly-Care-Skills training intervention as it helps in improving knowledge and skills performance in managing and caring for the elderly.

"Objectives This study aims to assess whether the characteristics, management and outcomes of women varied between Syrian and Palestinian refugees, migrant women of other nationalities and Lebanese women giving birth at a public tertiary centre in Beirut, Lebanon. Methods This was a secondary data analysis of routinely collected data from the public Rafik Hariri University Hospital (RHUH) between January 2011 and July 2018. Data were extracted from medical notes using text mining machine learning methods. Nationality was categorised into Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian and migrant women of other nationalities. The main outcomes were diabetes, pre-eclampsia, placenta accreta spectrum, hysterectomy, uterine rupture, blood transfusion, preterm birth and intrauterine fetal death. Logistic regression models estimated the association between nationality and maternal and infant outcomes, and these were presented using ORs and 95% CIs. Results 17 624 women gave birth at RHUH of whom 54.3% were Syrian, 39% Lebanese, 2.5% Palestinian and 4.2% migrant women of other nationalities. The majority of women had a caesarean section (73%) and 11% had a serious obstetric complication. Between 2011 and 2018, there was a decline in the use of primary caesarean section (caesarean section performed for the first time) from 7% to 4% of births (p<0.001). The odds of preeclampsia, placenta abruption and serious complications were significantly higher for Palestinian and migrant women of other nationalities compared to Lebanese women, but not for Syrian women. Very preterm birth was higher for Syrians (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.40) and migrant women of other nationalities (OR: 1.51, 95% CI: 1.13 to 2.03) compared to Lebanese women. Conclusion Syrian refugees in Lebanon had similar obstetric outcomes compared to the host population, except for very preterm birth. However, Palestinian women and migrant women of other nationalities appeared to have worse pregnancy complications than the Lebanese women. There should be better healthcare access and support for migrant populations to avoid severe complications of pregnancy.  © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved."
"Introduction: In recent years, research has used psycholinguistic features in public discourse, networking behaviors on social media and profile information to train models for depression detection. However, the most widely adopted approach for the extraction of psycholinguistic features is to use the Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) dictionary and various affective lexicons. Other features related to cultural factors and suicide risk have not been explored. Moreover, the use of social networking behavioral features and profile features would limit the generalizability of the model. Therefore, our study aimed at building a prediction model of depression for text-only social media data through a wider range of possible linguistic features related to depression, and illuminate the relationship between linguistic expression and depression. Methods: We collected 789 users’ depression scores as well as their past posts on Weibo, and extracted a total of 117 lexical features via Simplified Chinese Linguistic Inquiry Word Count, Chinese Suicide Dictionary, Chinese Version of Moral Foundations Dictionary, Chinese Version of Moral Motivation Dictionary, and Chinese Individualism/Collectivism Dictionary. Results: Results showed that all the dictionaries contributed to the prediction. The best performing model occurred with linear regression, with the Pearson correlation coefficient between predicted values and self-reported values was 0.33, the R-squared was 0.10, and the split-half reliability was 0.75. Discussion: This study did not only develop a predictive model applicable to text-only social media data, but also demonstrated the importance taking cultural psychological factors and suicide related expressions into consideration in the calculation of word frequency. Our research provided a more comprehensive understanding of how lexicons related to cultural psychology and suicide risk were associated with depression, and could contribute to the recognition of depression.

"Background: A steep increase in new drug applications has increased the overhead of writing technical documents such as medication guides. Natural language processing can contribute to reducing this burden. Objective: To generate medication guides from texts that relate to prescription drug labeling information. Materials and Methods: We collected official drug label information from the DailyMed website. We focused on drug labels containing medication guide sections to train and test our model. To construct our training dataset, we aligned “source” text from the document with similar “target” text from the medication guide using three families of alignment techniques: global, manual, and heuristic alignment. The resulting source-target pairs were provided as input to a Pointer Generator Network, an abstractive text summarization model. Results: Global alignment produced the lowest ROUGE scores and relatively poor qualitative results, as running the model frequently resulted in mode collapse. Manual alignment also resulted in mode collapse, albeit higher ROUGE scores than global alignment. Within the family of heuristic alignment approaches, we compared different methods and found BM25-based alignments to produce significantly better summaries (at least 6.8 ROUGE points above the other techniques). This alignment surpassed both the global and manual alignments in terms of ROUGE and qualitative scoring. Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that a heuristic approach to generating inputs for an abstractive summarization model increased ROUGE scores, compared to a global or manual approach when automatically generating biomedical text. Such methods hold the potential to significantly reduce the manual labor burden in medical writing and related disciplines. Copyright © 2023 Meyer, Adkins, Pal, Galici, Garcia-Agundez and Eickhoff."
"Importance: Ipsilateral neck radiotherapy (RT) is controversial in some patients with tonsil cancer due to concern for nodal failure within the contralateral nonirradiated neck (hereinafter referred to as contralateral neck failure [CNF]). Objective: To determine the rate of CNF following ipsilateral neck RT in patients with tonsil cancer. Data Sources: Databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were queried for peer-reviewed, English language articles published between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2021. Study Selection: Studies reporting rates of CNF from at least 20 patients treated with ipsilateral neck RT. Studies were excluded if they lacked full text, reported results from databases or systematic reviews, or did not provide RT details. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data were extracted following the PRISMA reporting guideline. Study quality was assessed using criteria from a methodological index for nonrandomized studies. Pooled outcomes were estimated using random-effects models. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was the pooled rate of CNF following ipsilateral neck RT. Secondary outcomes were the pooled rates of CNF by tumor and nodal staging categories from the 7th edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual and rates of toxic effects. Results: A total of 17 studies (16 retrospective and 1 prospective) including 1487 unique patients were identified. The pooled risk of CNF was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.2%-2.6%). The rate of CNF by tumor (T) category was as follows: 1.3% (95% CI, 0.3%-2.3%) for T1; 3.0% (95% CI, 1.6%-4.4%) for T2; 11.3% (95% CI, 3.3%-19.2%) for T3; and 16.0% (95% CI, -7.8% to 39.8%) for T4. Patients with T3 to T4 tumors had a significantly higher rate of CNF than those with T1 to T2 tumors (11.5% [95% CI, 3.9%-19.1%] vs 1.8% [95% CI, 1.0%-2.6%]; P <.001). The rate of CNF by nodal (N) category was 1.2% (95% CI, 0.1%-2.2%) for N0; 4.8% (95% CI, 2.4%-7.2%) for N1; 3.1% (95% CI, 0.4%-5.8%) for N2a; 3.1% (95% CI, 1.2%-4.9%) for N2b; and 0 (95% CI, not applicable) for N3. Rates of CNF were similar for patients with N2b to N3 and N0 to N2a disease (3.0% [95% CI, 1.2%-4.7%] vs 1.7% [95% CI, 0.6%-2.8%], respectively; P =.07). Compared with bilateral RT, ipsilateral RT was associated with increased risk of CNF (log odds ratio, 1.29 [95% CI, 0.09-2.48]; P =.04). The crude rates of xerostomia of grade 3 or greater and feeding tube use were 0.9% (95% CI, -0.2% to 1.9%) and 13.3% (95% CI, 8.3%-18.3%), respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, ipsilateral neck RT was associated with a low rate of CNF in patients with small, lateralized tonsil cancers. Bilateral neck RT was associated with lower risk of CNF compared with ipsilateral neck RT. Patients with tumors of a higher T category were at increased risk for CNF following ipsilateral neck RT, and advanced nodal stage was not associated with CNF. Rates of toxic effects appeared favorable in patients treated with ipsilateral neck RT.. © 2022 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."
"In recent years, Recommendation Systems (RSs) have become a vital component of numerous websites and online applications in a variety of domains. Consider, for instance, the e-commerce websites where RSs predominate. In part, the problem of information overload is mitigated by these RSs. However, RSs still have a few issues, such as data sparsity, which leads to another issue known as cold-start. The cold-start problem occurs when the user-item matrix is incredibly sparse. Additionally, RSs has a problem known as the long-tail problem, in which the system is incapable of providing suggestions due to insufficient or invalid ratings for often purchased products. The cold-start problem can be solved by providing recommendations based on captured user preferences and user feedback. User attitudes can be gleaned from the analysis of textual user reviews of purchased products. Sentiment analysis(SA), also known as opinion mining, is the study of people's opinions, feelings, judgments, feedbacks, and emotions conveyed through written language regarding entities and their features. Usually these sentiments are derived and based out of various contexts. A context in sentiment analysis is a mood-based natural attribute. Collaborative filtering (CF) method is by far and away the most popular and widely used algorithm for RSs to date. Collaborative filtering is a way for generating automatic predictions (filtering) about a user's interests by collecting preferences or taste data from a large number of users. In this study, we combine the functionality of a CF algorithm with contextual information extracted from user input. The varied situations are then assessed for sentiment using distinct attributes. Our model is known as FusionSCF. This study utilises two e-commerce datasets: Amazon.com and Flipkart.com. We predict and recommend products to users based on a combined weighted rating and sentiment score. We execute a lexicon-based sentiment analysis utilising several text classification methods for Natural Language Processing. The results reveal that the proposed contextual information sentiment-based model outperforms the conventional collaborative filtering technique. In the final phase of our work, we also explore the consequences of fake reviews on our filtering system. Also using a metric ""genuinity index"", we convey how reviews can be classified to genuine ones. © 2023 ACM."
"Plastic pollution control, involving the whole life cycle management of plastic production, consumption, sorting, recycling, and disposal, has become necessary for global sustainable development. Research on public attitudes is vital to understanding whether plastic pollution control policies are being successfully implemented and the degree to which the public is involved. However, few studies have assessed public attitudes toward plastic pollution control from the whole life cycle perspective, especially using big data. Based on China's whole life cycle management policy of plastics, this study collected more than 200,000 relevant comments and user information from Sina Weibo to analyze and evaluate public attitudes and opinions toward plastic pollution control. Spatial-temporal analysis was conducted to discover the regional and temporal differences in public attention. Using a sentiment classification method based on semantic analysis, the emotional tendencies of the public attitudes toward ten subdivided plastic pollution control links were studied. It was found that more people held a positive attitude and paid more attention to reusing and sorting links, while the negative emotions were concentrated on the collection and sorting links. Using a topic modeling method, the negative opinions in various links were revealed, such as lack of supervision and industry standards; over packaging or insufficient packaging; food safety problems caused by the reuse; high costs, poor use and possibly greater waste of substitutes; unclear sorting rules and insufficient supporting measures. Graph theory was applied to display these opinions. Finally, some policy implications derived from the discussions are given. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Introduction Institutionally based intensive treatment modalities (inpatient, day patient and residential treatments) for eating disorders (EDs) are associated with high treatment costs and significant challenges for patients and carers, including access difficulties and disruption to daily routines. Intensive community and home-based treatments have been suggested as alternatives to institutionally based intensive treatments for other severe mental illnesses, with promising clinical, social and health economic outcomes. The possible advantages of these treatments have been proposed for EDs, but this emerging area of research has not yet been systematically investigated. This scoping review aims to map the available literature on intensive community and home treatments for EDs, focusing on their conceptualisation, implementation and clinical outcomes. Methods This proposed scoping review will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol extension for Scoping Reviews checklist and the Joanna Briggs Institute Reviewer's Manual. This review will include any peer-reviewed study concerning intensive community and home-based treatments for any EDs, with no restrictions on geographical context or study design. Grey literature will also be considered. The literature search will be conducted in four databases: PubMed, PsycInfo, MEDLINE and Web of Science. Two researchers will independently screen the titles, abstracts and text of the returned articles for eligibility. Data charting and analysis will consist of a narrative description of the included studies, quantitative and qualitative findings relative to the aims of this scoping review. Gaps in the literature will be highlighted to inform future research, clinical practice, and policy. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required as all data are available from public sources. The results of this scoping review will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, conference presentation, and social media. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved."
"In the article “Duration Selectivity in Right Parietal Cortex Reflects the Subjective Experience of Time,” by Masamichi J. Hayashi and Richard B. Ivry, which appeared on pages 7749-7758 of the September 30, 2020 issue, the description of the original analysis procedure included an error. The authors note: “For normalization of the fMRI data to the MNI stereotactic space, we used a unified segmentation and normalization procedure, the standard normalization procedure in SPM12. However, the text erroneously stated that we used the diffeomorphic anatomic registration through exponentiated lie algebra (DARTEL) algorithms, an optional procedure for spatial normalization in SPM12.” On page 7751 of the article, in the Materials and Methods subsection on MRI data acquisition and preprocessing, the second to last sentence should have read: “The fMRI data were normalized in MNI space using the unified segmentation and normalization procedure provided in SPM12.” The authors regret the error. © 2023 Society for Neuroscience.

"Objective To analyze the hotspots and frontiers of diabetic peripheral neuropathy nursing research in the past decade in China, and to provide nursing staff with a reference basis for understanding and grasping the direction of research. Methods The literature related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy nursing from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2021 was searched through China Journal Full Text Database, China Biomedical Literature Database, CQVIP, and Wanfang, and visualized and analyzed by using CiteSpace software. Results A total of 763 articles were included in the literature, and the number of articles was analyzed to show a significant upward trend in 2018-2021, with the most articles by authors being 4 each by Liu Dan and An Caixia, and the most articles by institutions being 6 and 5 by Nanjing Chinese Medicine Hospital and Shanghai Jiading District Chinese Medicine Hospital, respectively, with research hotspots being complications related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy, rehabilitation care, and special Chinese medicine care techniques, and research frontiers being quality of life and neurological function. Conclusions The research base of diabetic peripheral neuropathy is weak, and researchers should focus on the frontiers of international research hotspots in diabetic peripheral neuropathy care to help nursing research produce prospective, high-impact research results and improve patient clinical outcomes. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Objectives Increasing access to mental health support is a key factor for treating mental disorders, however, important barriers complicate help-seeking, among them, mental health related stigma being most prominent. We aimed to systematically review the current evidence for interventions focusing on reducing stigma related to mental health problems in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Design Systematic review with a focus on interventions targeting mental health related stigma in the workplace in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The methodological quality of included articles was assessed using the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies Scale. Data sources PubMed, Ovid Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Cochrane databases and Google Scholar were searched from January 2010 until November 2022. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies We included experimental or quasi-experimental studies about workplace interventions aiming to reduce stigma, where the outcomes were measured in terms of stigmatisation against depression, anxiety and/or other mental health problems. Data extraction and synthesis Records were screened by two independent reviewers after inspecting titles and abstracts and a full-text read of the articles to assess whether they meet inclusion criteria. The results were synthesised narratively. Results We identified 22 intervention studies, 3 with high quality, 13 with moderate quality and 6 with weak quality. Only 2 studies included SMEs, but no study focused on SMEs exclusively. The mode of delivery of the intervention was face to face in 15 studies, online in 4 studies and mixed in 3 studies. We found a significant reduction in stigmatising attitudes in almost all studies (20/22), using 10 different instruments/scales. Effects seemed to be independent of company size. Online interventions were found to be shorter, but seemed to be as effective as face-to-face interventions. Conclusions Although we did not find interventions focusing exclusively on SMEs, it is likely that antistigma interventions also will work in smaller workplaces.

"Background. Caring for chronic psychiatric patients places a complex burden on patients' caregivers. Paying attention to the needs of caregivers based on the cultural conditions of the country in which they live is of particular importance to improve the quality of care. Methods. In this study, 30 caregivers of patients with schizophrenia who were treated for at least two months by a regular psychiatrist joined the study over six months. They contacted the psychiatrist via SMS when their patient was in remission. In total, 1581 text messages were sent during 3 years. All messages were evaluated by three faculty members through the qualitative content analysis method. Results. The results of this study were categorized into training, reporting, and the expression of feelings themes and several codes. Conclusion. Addressing the caregivers needs to take steps forward to improve the effective two-way treatment relationship and prevent the gap between patients, caregivers, and the health care staff. Practical Implications. Paying attention to different dimensions of caregivers' concerns while caring for patients with chronic psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia can have a significant impact on controlling the disease and improving the quality of life of patients and their family members. © 2022, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences.

"Using Chinese listed companies as the research setting, this study investigates the impact of climate risk on corporate precautionary cash holdings and further explores possible underlying channels. We first apply the text mining technique to construct the climate risk indicator. The regression results then show that climate risk has a significant and positive impact on corporate precautionary cash holdings. Such positive relationship is stronger for firms with small size and those located in central and eastern China. Further mechanism analysis indicates that risk taking and external financing play a mediating effect between climate risk and corporate precautionary cash holdings. Our findings have important practical implications for companies to make sustainability strategies against potential climate risks. Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Yang and Li."
"In the modern era, the quantity of data, specifically the text data, has increased rapidly. Recently, fake news has gained a lot of attention worldwide. Generally, fake news is propagated through different social media. The effects of fake news may be economic, political, organizational, or personal. To save the life of community from fake news propagation, identification of fake news at an initial point is crucial. The fake news propagators target innocent people for spreading the fake news and they become a part of fake news propagation unknowingly. To prevent this kind of activity, fake news detection and its blueprint of propagation becomes crucial to community and government. This chapter makes an analysis related to the prediction of fake news through the help of supervised ML algorithms. The ML algorithms are adopted for the categorization of fake news as true or false with the help of NLP textual analysis and feature extraction. However, during the testing phase, the XGB algorithm gives the best result over other ML algorithms with an accuracy of 99%. © 2023, IGI Global. All rights reserved."
"At the beginning of 2020 the world was shocked by the COVID-19 pandemic which paralyzed all aspects of activity for some time. However, over time and with the discovery of a vaccine, the cases caused by COVID-19 began to subside. In 2022, the Indonesian government make a policy that people are allowed to take off their masks when active but are encouraged to maintain health protocols. However, the approach reaped the pros and cons of the Indonesian people. One challenge is to build technology to detect and summarize an overall those pros and cons. So that, we look at Twitter and build models for classifying ‘tweets’ into positive, negative and neutral sentiment using top two approaches for sentiment analysis, the lexicon-based method and the naive Bayes classifier. This study aimed to analyze public opinion about removing masks through Twitter by comparing the lexicon-based method and the naive Bayes classifier method to find out how the community responded to taking off masks. A total of 639 tweets with the keyword ""Lepas Masker"" was analyzed include data crawling, text preprocessing, feature extractions and the classification process. The comparison of the results obtained shows the accuracy of 82% for the lexicon-based method and 70% for the naive Bayes classifier method. To the results, the accuracy value of the lexicon-based method is higher than the naive Bayes classifier method. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific. All rights reserved."
"Objective: To investigate the effects of orthodontic tooth movement on clinical attachment level (CAL) changes in treated periodontitis in adult patients with malocclusion. Material and Methods: Present study is based on PRISMA guidelines; all articles published in international databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, and Embase between 2012 to May 2022 are included. 95% confidence interval (CI) for mean difference with fixed effect modal and inverse-variance were calculated. Data analysis was performed using STATA.V16 software. Results: In the initial review, duplicate studies were eliminated, abstracts of 175 studies were reviewed, two authors reviewed the full text of 21 studies, and finally, eleven studies were selected. The mean of CAL gain was 2.29 mm (MD, 95% CI-2.47 mm,-2.12 mm; p=0.00) (I2=91.81%; p=0.00; high heterogeneity). The mean difference of PPD changes was –1.93 mm (MD, 95% CI-2.07 mm,-1.80 mm; p=0.00) (I2=98.52%; p=0.00; high heterogeneity). Conclusion: Due to the limitations of the study and based on the meta-analysis, it is observed that orthodontic treatment is performed with higher success after reconstructive surgery with periodontal improvement. © 2023, Association of Support to Oral Health Research (APESB).

"Objective This paper provides a systematic review of evidence of government purchase of health services from private providers through stand-alone contracting-out (CO) initiatives and CO insurance schemes (CO-I) on health service utilisation in Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) to inform universal health coverage 2030 strategies. Design Systematic review. Data sources Electronic search of published and grey literature on Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, CINHAL, Google Scholar and web, including websites of ministries of health from January 2010 to November 2021. Eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, time series, before-after and endline with comparison group reporting quantitative utilisation of data across 16 low-income and middle-income states of EMR. Search was limited to publications in English or English translation. Data extraction and synthesis We planned for meta-analysis, but due to limited data and heterogeneous outcomes, descriptive analysis was performed. Results Several initiatives were identified but only 128 studies were eligible for full-text screening and 17 met the inclusion criteria. These included CO (n=9), CO-I (n=3) and a combination of both (n=5) across seven countries. Eight studies assessed interventions at national level and nine at subnational level. Seven studies reported on purchasing arrangements with non-governmental organisations, 10 on private hospitals and clinics. Impact on outpatient curative care utilisation was seen in both CO and CO-I, positive evidence of improved maternity care service volumes was seen mainly from CO interventions and less reported from CO-I, whereas data on child health service volume was only available for CO and indicated negative impact on service volumes. The studies also suggest pro-poor effect for CO initiatives, whereas there was scarce data for CO-I. Conclusion Purchasing involving stand-alone CO and CO-I interventions in EMR positively impact general curative care utilisation, but lacks conclusive evidence for other services. Policy attention is needed for embedded evaluations within programmes, standardised outcome metrics and disaggregated utilisation data.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"Nineteenth-century European narrative literature repeatedly refers to the deliberate destruction (or intentions, attempts to destroy) of artificial images. The old artist in Honoré de Balzac's novella The Unknown Masterpiece burns his collection of art; the hero of Alexander Pushkin's poem The Bronze Horseman threatens the monument to the Emperor Peter the Great in St Petersburg; the inhabitants of a French village in Prosper Mérimée's novella The Venus of Ille re-melt the 'evil' antique statue found in the soil; the painter in Nikolai Gogol's novel The Portrait compulsively buys and destroys masterpieces of painting; another picture, in Emile Zola's novel L'Œuvre, is burned after the suicide of its author; the hero of Oscar Wilde's novel The Picture of Dorian Gray attempts to stab his own portrait, which is displaying his sins; in The Adventure of the Six Napoleons, a short story by Arthur Conan Doyle, six busts of the French emperor are broken, in turn first by a thief, and finally by a detective. Being destroyed or disappearing seems to be the recurrent destiny of intradiegetic images (material images included into a narrative text as its actors), and the attempts of their obliteration always constitute a highlighted, spectacular moment in the narrative, and not just an outward sign of someone's inner feelings; they are typically presented as a sacrifice of 'excessive' (magical, demonic) objects. In some cases, they are explained by a deviant behaviour of the character (madness, delinquency), but the literary text is organized in order to make the reader sympathize with the experiences of that 'iconoclast', and mentally reproduce his acts. An analysis of texts should disclose the mechanism of this self-identification and put the stories about the attempts on the image into the general framework of nineteenth-century visual and literary culture.  © The Author(s), 2023.

"Background: Little is known about the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on community health serVICe staff. The aim of this study was to assess the immediate and longer-term psychosocial impacts of COVID-19 on community health serVICe staff in Australia. Methods: A prospective cohort design with an anonymous cross-sectional online survey that was administered at two time points (March-April 2021; n = 681 and September-October 2021; n = 479). Staff (clinical and non-clinical) were recruited from eight community health services in Victoria, Australia. Study-specific questions evaluated the impact of COVID-19 on respondents' work and personal lives. Space was provided at the end of the surveys for free-text comments. Results: There were no significant differences in respondent characteristics between the two surveys. At both survey time points, respondents were mostly concerned about their family's health. Compared to the first survey, survey two respondents were significantly more likely to report concerns about infecting family members (48.8% vs 41.6%, P = 0.029), clients having COVID-19 (43.2% vs 36.2%, P = 0.035), getting COVID-19 at work (53.7% vs 45.6%, P = 0.014), not being prepared to care for clients with COVID-19 (27.5% vs 18.8%, P = 0.006) and feeling more stress at work (63.7% vs 50.8%, P < 0.001). A significantly greater proportion of respondents indicated they were considering transitioning into another sector at the time of the second survey compared to the first (24.8% vs 18.7%, P = 0.026). Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a considerable impact on the work and personal lives of community health serVICe staff. Staff would benefit from continued and targeted initiatives that address their wellbeing and concerns. © 2023 CSIRO. All rights reserved."
"Ice and snow are natural phenomena as well as valuable tourism resources. Originating in the European mountains in the late 19th century, ice-snow tourism has become an increasingly significant sector of the tourism industry. Despite sustained growth, international ice-snow tourism has faced unprecedented threats in recent years. The ice-snow tourism in China has developed in recent years. However, ice-snow tourism industry in China has proliferated in the past few years, especially after China won the 2022 Winter Olympics bid in 2015. The purpose of this study is to summarize international studies on ice-snow tourism and then provide references for future studies in China. Articles associated with ice-snow tourism, published before the year 2021, were retrieved from the Web of Science core collection with the topics “ice tourism”, “ski tourism”, “snow tourism”, “winter tourism” and “ski resort”. Based on a systematic review of the literature, Citespace was also used to perform text mining and visual analysis. The results show that: (1) Research of international ice-snow tourism increased continuously from the year of 1988, with developed countries in Europe and America contributing most of the research, while China showed its great potential in this field. (2) Tourism injuries dominated the initial phase of international ice-snow tourism studies, whereas climate change attracted attention afterward due to the consensus on global warming. In recent studies, studies have focused on ice-snow tourism industry sustainability, diversity of products and services in ski resorts, and other micro-level topics. (3) Knowledge structure of international ice-snow tourism studies was visualized as co-citation clusters, with 7 clusters identified. As a result of comparing labels and reading associated articles, these clusters could be grouped into three main categories: Impact on the natural environment, tourists' experience, and industry development. Additionally, this study suggests that Chinese research on ice-snow tourism has generally focused on discourse at the macro level, and used similar perspectives, conventional data sources and research methods compared to international studies. Therefore, this study concludes that future research on ice-snow tourism in China should pay more attention to in-depth case studies, multiple perspectives, new data and methods, and the practical value of research. © 2023, Science Press.

"The problem of Region of Interest (RoI) in document layout analysis and document recognition has recently become an essential topic in OCRing systems. Arabic manuscript layout analysis and OCRing recognition using language detection, document category, and RoI with Keras and TensorFlow are terms of the state-of-The-Art that should be investigated. This article investigates the problem of Arabic manuscript recognition problems with respect to in OCRing-based recognition. A new framework architecture, which integrates Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) using Keras and TensorFlow with adversarial image generation during training procedure is proposed. Also, the article tries to improve the OCRing accuracy of the image enhancement, alignment, layout analysis, and recognition using deep learning in multilingual system. RoIs detections will be performed using a custom trained deep learning model using bounding box regression with Keras and TensorFlow. This topic investigates an extension of Page Segmentation Method (PSM) to enhance OCRing parameter modes and enhances Arabic OCRing system accuracy from reinforcement strategy. Therefore, the article achieves a significant improvement of OCRing results due to the three parameters: language identification, document category, and RoI types (Table, Title, Paragraph, figure, and list). This model is based on ""region proposal algorithm""as a basis of CNN object detectors to find the number of the RoIs. Therefore, the proposed framework performs three distinctive tasks: (1) CNN architecture for adversarial training, (2) an implementation of the FGSM with Keras and TensorFlow, and (3) an adversarial training script implementation with the CNN and the FGSM method. The experiments on Arabic manuscript dataset including Arabic text, English/Arabic documents, and Latin digits' datasets, demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed framework performs well and succeeded in defending against adversarial attacks or adversarial images. The experimental results on our collected dataset illustrate the novelty of our proposed framework over the other existing PSM methods to be extended and updated to improve the quality of the OCRing system. The results show that the influence of PSM after expanding using the RoI types, language ID, and document/manuscript category can improve the OCRing accuracy. Also, the experimental results show significant performance by the new framework model with accuracy reached to 99% compared to relative methods. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery."
"OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study is to assess the distinguishing features of pregnancy-related hypophysitis (PR-Hy) compared to non-pregnancy autoimmune hypophysitis and to evaluate the changing therapeutic approaches and outcomes in PR-Hy over time. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of all published cases with PR-Hy and 6 own cases. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed and abstracts screened for publications with information on cases with PR-Hy from which full-text review was performed. Clinical features, diagnostic findings, and outcome in relation to treatment modalities in PR-Hy were assessed. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-eight cases with PR-Hy were identified. PR-Hy was significantly delimited from non-PR-Hy by the frequent occurrence of the chiasmal syndrome (50% vs 13%, P < .0001), higher rate of intrasellar origin (94% vs 74%, P = .0005), lower rate of pituitary stalk involvement (39% vs 86%, P < .0001), and low rate of diabetes insipidus (12% vs 54%, P < .0001). The role of surgery in PR-Hy decreased over time while noninvasive treatment modalities increased. The recurrence rate after high-dose glucocorticoid therapy (33%) was high and exceeded that of surgery (2%) and conservative management (2%). In contrast to initial reports on PR-Hy, recent literature regarding outcome of mother's and child's health was positive. The frequency of spontaneous preterm delivery was not increased. Recurrent PR-Hy in a subsequent pregnancy was reported in only two females. CONCLUSION: PR-Hy has distinct features that delineate the disorder from non-PR-Hy. With increasing experience in diagnosis, availability of adequate replacement therapy, and improved treatment modalities, PR-Hy has lost its threat and the outcome is encouraging. © The Author(s) 2023.

"Background: Single-session mental health interventions are frequently attended by children and young people (CYP) in both web-based and face-to-face therapy settings. The Session “Wants” and “Needs” Outcome Measure (SWAN-OM) is an instrument developed in a web-based therapy service to overcome the challenges of collecting outcomes and experiences of single-session therapies (SSTs). It provides pre-defined goals for the session, selected by the young person prior to the intervention, on which progress toward achievement is scored at the end of the session. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the instrument's psychometric properties, including concurrent validity against three other frequently used outcome and experience measures, at a web-based and text-based mental health service. Methods: The SWAN-OM was administered for a period of 6 months to 1,401 CYP (aged 10–32 years; 79.3% white; 77.59% female) accessing SST on a web-based service. Item correlations with comparator measures and hierarchical logistic regressions to predict item selection were calculated for concurrent validity and psychometric exploration. Results: The most frequently selected items were “Feel better” (N = 431; 11.61%) and “Find ways I can help myself” (N = 411; 11.07%); unpopular items were “Feel safe in my relationships” (N = 53; 1.43%) and “Learn the steps to achieve something I want” (N = 58; 1.56%). The SWAN-OM was significantly correlated with the Experience of Service Questionnaire, particularly the item “Feel better” [rs(109) = 0.48, p < 0.001], the Youth Counseling Impact Scale, particularly the item “Learn the steps to achieve something I want” [rs(22) = 0.76, p < 0.001], and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, particularly the items “Learn how to feel better” [rs(22) = 0.72, p < 0.001] and “Explore how I feel” [rs(70) = −0.44, p < 0.001]. Conclusion: The SWAN-OM demonstrates good concurrent validity with common measures of outcome and experience. Analysis suggests that lesser-endorsed items may be removed in future iterations of the measure to improve functionality. Future research is required to explore SWAN-OM's potential to measure meaningful change in a range of therapeutic settings.

"The ability of the ancient Egyptians to preserve the human body through embalming has not only fascinated people since antiquity, but also has always raised the question of how this outstanding chemical and ritual process was practically achieved. Here we integrate archaeological, philological and organic residue analyses, shedding new light on the practice and economy of embalming in ancient Egypt. We analysed the organic contents of 31 ceramic vessels recovered from a 26th Dynasty embalming workshop at Saqqara1,2. These vessels were labelled according to their content and/or use, enabling us to correlate organic substances with their Egyptian names and specific embalming practices. We identified specific mixtures of fragrant or antiseptic oils, tars and resins that were used to embalm the head and treat the wrappings using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry analyses. Our study of the Saqqara workshop extends interpretations from a micro-level analysis highlighting the socio-economic status of a tomb owner3–7 to macro-level interpretations of the society. The identification of non-local organic substances enables the reconstruction of trade networks that provided ancient Egyptian embalmers with the substances required for mummification. This extensive demand for foreign products promoted trade both within the Mediterranean8–10 (for example, Pistacia and conifer by-products) and with tropical forest regions (for example, dammar and elemi). Additionally, we show that at Saqqara, antiu and sefet—well known from ancient texts and usually translated as ‘myrrh’ or ‘incense’11–13 and ‘a sacred oil’13,14—refer to a coniferous oils-or-tars-based mixture and an unguent with plant additives, respectively. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Introduction People often experience significant difficulties in receiving mental healthcare due to insufficient resources, stigma and lack of access to care. Remote care technology has the potential to overcome these barriers by reducing travel time and increasing frequency of contact with patients. However, the safe delivery of remote mental healthcare requires evidence on which aspects of care are suitable for remote delivery and which are better served by in-person care. We aim to investigate clinical and demographic associations with remote mental healthcare in a large electronic health record (EHR) dataset and the degree to which remote care is associated with differences in clinical outcomes using natural language processing (NLP) derived EHR data. Methods and analysis Deidentified EHR data, derived from the South London and Maudsley (SLaM) National Health Service Foundation Trust Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) Case Register, will be extracted using the Clinical Record Interactive Search tool for all patients receiving mental healthcare between 1 January 2019 and 31 March 2022. First, data on a retrospective, longitudinal cohort of around 80 000 patients will be analysed using descriptive statistics to investigate clinical and demographic associations with remote mental healthcare and multivariable Cox regression to compare clinical outcomes of remote versus in-person assessments. Second, NLP models that have been previously developed to extract mental health symptom data will be applied to around 5 million documents to analyse the variation in content of remote versus in-person assessments. Ethics and dissemination The SLaM BRC Case Register and Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) tool have received ethical approval as a deidentified dataset (including NLP-derived data from unstructured free text documents) for secondary mental health research from Oxfordshire REC C (Ref: 18/SC/0372). The study has received approval from the SLaM CRIS Oversight Committee. Study findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed, open access journal articles and service user and carer advisory groups. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved."
"Objectives. We recently studied the association between various human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). According to our analysis, HLA-B*50 and HLA-DQA1*3 alleles were positively associated with ESRD, while B*40, DRB1*12, DRB1*13, and DQA1*6 alleles were negatively associated with ESRD. However, a single case-control study does not have enough statistical power to evaluate the possible impact of genetic polymorphism on any disease. Hence, the main objective of this meta-analysis is to determine the association between these abovementioned HLA alleles and ESRD. Design. MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched through December 2020 for case-control studies on the associations between HLA polymorphisms and ESRD. Independent reviewers screened the texts of potentially eligible studies and assessed the risk of bias. The meta-analysis was conducted based on the checklists and guidelines based on PRISMA. Results. We identified 26 case-control studies comprising 1,312 ESRD and 3,842 healthy subjects. A non-significant positive association was observed between HLA-B*50 (OR = 1.02, 95% CI [0.90, 1.24]), HLA-B*40 (OR = 1.75, 95% CI [0.98, 3.2]), HLA-DQA1*3, (OR = 1.17, 95% CI [0.74, 1.84]), DRB1*12 (OR = 1.05, 95% CI [0.94, 1.18]) alleles and ESRD. In addition, a non-significant negative association was observed between HLA-DRB1*13 (OR = 0.90, CI [0.81, 1.01]), HLA-DQB1*6 (OR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.58, 1.07]) alleles and ESRD. Conclusions. Our meta-analysis indicates no significant association between HLAB*50, HLA-DQA1*3, B*40, DRB1*12, DRB1*13, and DQA1*6 alleles and ESRD. Further studies with larger sample sizes and adjustments for confounders are required to confirm these conclusions. Copyright 2023 Noureen and Zaidi."
"Introduction: The present systematic review and meta-analysis explores the impacts of cognitive processing therapy (CPT), eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), and prolonged exposure (PE) therapy on neural activity underlying the phenomenon of post-traumatic growth for adult trauma survivors. Methods: We utilized the following databases to conduct our systematic search: Boston College Libraries, PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO. Our initial search yielded 834 studies for initial screening. We implemented seven eligibility criteria to vet articles for full-text review. Twenty-nine studies remained for full-text review after our systematic review process was completed. Studies were subjected to several levels of analysis. First, pre-and post- test post-traumatic growth inventory (PTGI) scores were collected from all studies and analyzed through a forest plot using Hedges’ g. Next, Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates and t-scores were collected and analyzed using an Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) to measure brain function. T-scores and Hedges’ g values were then analyzed using Pearson correlations to determine if there were any relationships between brain function and post-traumatic growth for each modality. Lastly, all studies were subjected to a bubble plot and Egger’s test to assess risk of publication bias across the review sample. Results: Forest plot results indicated that all three interventions had a robust effect on PTGI scores. ALE meta-analysis results indicated that EMDR exhibited the largest effect on brain function, with the R thalamus (t = 4.23, p < 0.001) showing robust activation, followed closely by the R precuneus (t = 4.19, p < 0.001). Pearson correlation results showed that EMDR demonstrated the strongest correlation between increased brain function and PTGI scores (r = 0.910, p < 0.001). Qualitative review of the bubble plot indicated no obvious traces of publication bias, which was corroborated by the results of the Egger’s test (p = 0.127). Discussion: Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed that CPT, EMDR, and PE each exhibited a robust effect on PTG impacts across the course of treatment. However, when looking closer at comparative analyses of neural activity (ALE) and PTGI scores (Pearson correlation), EMDR exhibited a more robust effect on PTG impacts and brain function than CPT and PE.

"Data charts are very prevalent in everyday life in different contexts, from economics to politics. However, people with blindness and low vision do not have easy access to this information since they use screen reader software. This software does not extract the information available graphically, but only the chart legend and the text. Among the solutions proposed in the literature, there are crowdsourcing techniques when a person is responsible for interpreting the chart, which can cause bias in the chart’s interpretation. To solve this problem, we proposed textual description templates for simple and grouped bar charts to inform the chart data in a standardized way to users, excluding the interpretation bias. The methodology of this work was divided into three stages: a definition of templates for textual description and testing with 30 participants; the application of textual description templates in an assistive technology tool and testing with 45 participants; the validation of the results found through interviews and tests with 3 specialists. We have iteratively refined templates generated at each stage with users tests, and we carried out quantitative and qualitative analyses. An assistive technology tool, ChartVision, was developed to consume the templates. Finally, we interviewed a specialist about how he would explain chart materials to blind students at university, and we carried out a validation of the final templates with two other professionals from the health and education areas who deal with people with blind people in their daily lives. The main contributions are three textual description bar charts templates: simple bar for applications with sequential reading or reading on-demand, grouped bar for applications with sequential reading, and grouped bar for applications on-demand. The secondary contribution is ChartVision. Other findings include considerations about the synthetic voice used in the tests, expected characteristics for a better understanding of the chart, and interaction ways to access the information. © 2023, Brazilian Computing Society.

"Nowadays, the application of machine learning for developing prediction models is one of the most critical research areas. Early prediction of anti-patterns using machine learning can help developers, and testers fix the design issues and utilize the resources effectively. This work analyzes four different sets of metrics, i.e., source code, WSDL, text, and sequence metrics, to develop web service anti-pattern prediction models. These sets of metrics are treated as an input for models trained using thirty-eight classification techniques to build a model. The experimental finding shows that the models trained using sequence metrics produce better results. The experimental finding also confirmed that the models trained on balanced data achieved better performance than the original data. Further, it is also found that the models trained using CNN and LSTM deep learning approach achieve better results compared to other techniques. © 2023 ACM."
"Introduction Health inequities are differences in health between groups of people that are avoidable, unfair and unjust. Achieving equitable health outcomes requires approaches that recognise and account for the differences in levels of advantage between groups. Implementation science, which studies how to translate evidence-based interventions into routine practice, is increasingly recognised as an approach to address health inequities by identifying factors and processes that enable equitable implementation of interventions. This article describes the protocol for a scoping review of the literature relating to the equitable implementation of interventions, focusing on ethnicity-related health inequities. The scoping review aims to identify equity-focused implementation science theories, models and frameworks (TMFs) and to synthesise and analyse the evidence relating to the factors that aid or inhibit equitable implementation of health interventions. Methods and analysis The scoping review is guided by the methodology developed by Arksey and O'Malley and enhanced by Levac and colleagues. Relevant literature will be identified by searching electronic databases, grey literature, hand-searching key journals and searching the reference lists and citations of studies that meet the inclusion criteria. We will focus on literature published from 2011 to the present. Titles, abstracts and full-text articles will be screened independently by two researchers; any disagreements will be resolved through discussion with another researcher. Extracted data will be summarised and analysed to address the scoping review aims. Ethics and dissemination The scoping review will map the available literature on equity-focused implementation science TMFs and the facilitators and barriers to equitable implementation of interventions. Ethical approval is not required. Dissemination of the results of the review will include publications in peer-review journals and conference and stakeholder presentations. Findings from the review will support those implementing interventions to ensure that the implementation pathway and processes are equitable, thereby improving health outcomes and reducing existing inequities. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023."
"Objectives To chart the global literature on gender equity in academic health research. Design Scoping review. Participants Quantitative studies were eligible if they examined gender equity within academic institutions including health researchers. Primary and secondary outcome measures Outcomes related to equity across gender and other social identities in academia: (1) faculty workforce: representation of all genders in university/faculty departments, academic rank or position and salary; (2) service: teaching obligations and administrative/non-teaching activities; (3) recruitment and hiring data: number of applicants by gender, interviews and new hires for various rank; (4) promotion: opportunities for promotion and time to progress through academic ranks; (5) academic leadership: type of leadership positions, opportunities for leadership promotion or training, opportunities to supervise/mentor and support for leadership bids; (6) scholarly output or productivity: number/type of publications and presentations, position of authorship, number/value of grants or awards and intellectual property ownership; (7) contextual factors of universities; (8) infrastructure; (9) knowledge and technology translation activities; (10) availability of maternity/paternity/parental/family leave; (11) collaboration activities/opportunities for collaboration; (12) qualitative considerations: perceptions around promotion, finances and support. Results Literature search yielded 94 798 citations; 4753 full-text articles were screened, and 562 studies were included. Most studies originated from North America (462/562, 82.2%). Few studies (27/562, 4.8%) reported race and fewer reported sex/gender (which were used interchangeably in most studies) other than male/female (11/562, 2.0%). Only one study provided data on religion. No other PROGRESS-PLUS variables were reported. A total of 2996 outcomes were reported, with most studies examining academic output (371/562, 66.0%). Conclusions Reviewed literature suggest a lack in analytic approaches that consider genders beyond the binary categories of man and woman, additional social identities (race, religion, social capital and disability) and an intersectionality lens examining the interconnection of multiple social identities in understanding discrimination and disadvantage. All of these are necessary to tailor strategies that promote gender equity. Trial registration number Open Science Framework: https://osf.io/8wk7e/. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

"The paper presents an analysis of standard Belarusian modals of necessity, based on the Belacorpus, a corpus of contemporary written Belarusian I built in 2010. I investigate the modals’ semantics (which types of modality they express), their frequency in the corpus and their distribution across textual genres. My study confirms what was already observed in previous accounts of Belarusian modals. Namely, only two of them, music’ and pavinen, are polyfunctional (that is, they can express more than one type of modality – dynamic, deontic and epistemic) and thus prototypical (core) members of the modal category. All other modal expressions are dedicated to one type of modality and are thus peripheral. The corpus analysis has also revealed a number of previously unnoticed properties of Belarusian modals, such as: the extreme rarity of the epistemic use of polyfunctional music’ and pavinen; the uneven distribution of peripheral modals across different types of texts; and the fact that the two standards in which Belarusian is codified, taraškevica and narkamaŭka, present no significant difference as far as the use of modals is concerned, with the notable exception of modal mec’ ‘have’, which is much more frequent in taraškevica texts. © 2022 Author(s)."
"BACKGROUND: Patient decision aids (PDAs) are tools designed to facilitate decision-making. In this systematic review, we summarized existing studies on the development and evaluation of PDAs for patients with hematologic malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. We searched for articles in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We included studies, abstracts, and clinical trial protocols available in English involving PDAs for patients age ≥18 diagnosed with a hematologic malignancy and/or their caregivers. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Of the 5281 titles/abstracts screened, 15 were included: 1 protocol, 7 abstracts, and 7 full-texts. Six were PDA developmental studies, 6 were pilot studies, and 3 were randomized trials. PDA formats included electronic with web content, videos, and/or audio, questionnaires, bedside instruments, and a combination of various formats. Average participant age ranged from 36.0 to 62.4 years. Patients and caregivers identified efficacy, adverse effects, cost, and quality of life as important decision-making factors. PDAs were associated with increased knowledge and patient satisfaction as well as decreased decisional conflict and attitudinal barriers. Research on PDAs for adult patients with hematologic malignancies and their caregivers is limited. Among the studies, PDAs appear to support patients in shared decision-making. CONCLUSION: While current literature examining the use of PDAs for adults with hematologic malignancies is limited, the positive impact of PDAs on shared decision-making and patient outcomes warrants additional research in this field. © The Author(s) 2022.

"Remote simultaneous interpreting (RSI) draws on Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) to facilitate multilingual communication by connecting conference interpreters to in-presence, virtual or hybrid events. Early solutions for RSI involved interpreters working in interpreting booths with physical hardware. However, in recent years, cloud-based solutions for RSI have emerged, with innovative Simultaneous Interpreting Delivery Platforms (SIDPs) at their core, enabling RSI delivery from anywhere. Initial explorations of the cloud-based solutions suggest that there is room for improving many of the widely used SIDPs. This chapter outlines an ongoing experimental study that investigates two aspects of SIDPs: the design of the interpreter interface and the integration of automatic speech recognition (ASR) in the interface to aid/augment the interpreter's source-text comprehension. Preliminary pilot study data suggests that interpreters have a preference towards cleaner interfaces with a better view of the speaker's hand gestures and body language. Performance analysis of a subsample of three participants indicates that while the most experienced interpreter had a similar performance across different experimental conditions (i.e., presentation of source speech with/without ASR-generated transcript), differences were apparent for the other two interpreters. © Peter Lang GmbH.

"Background: The number of psychological studies on conspiracy beliefs has been systematically growing for about a dozen years, but in recent years, the trend has intensified. We provided a review covering the psychological literature on conspiracy beliefs from 2018 to 2021. Halfway through this period, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, accompanied by an explosion of movements based on conspiracy theories, intensifying researchers’ interest in this issue. Methods: Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, the review systematically searched for relevant journal articles published between 2018 and 2021. A search was done on Scopus and Web of Science (only peer-reviewed journals). A study was included if it contained primary empirical data, if specific or general conspiracy belief(s) were measured and if its correlation with at least one other psychological variable was reported. All the studies were grouped for the descriptive analysis according to the methodology used, the participants’ characteristics, the continent of origin, the sample size, and the conspiracy beliefs measurement tools. Due to substantial methodological heterogeneity of the studies, narrative synthesis was performed. The five researchers were assigned specific roles at each stage of the analysis to ensure the highest quality of the research. Results: Following the proposed methodology, 308 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 274 articles (417 studies) meeting the inclusion criteria were identified and included in the review. Almost half of the studies (49.6%) were conducted in European countries. The vast majority of the studies (85.7%) were carried out on samples of adult respondents. The research presents antecedents as well as (potential) consequences of conspiracy beliefs. We grouped the antecedents of conspiracy beliefs into six categories: cognitive (e.g., thinking style) motivational (e.g., uncertainty avoidance), personality (e.g., collective narcissism), psychopathology (e.g., Dark Triad traits), political (e.g., ideological orientation), and sociocultural factors (e.g., collectivism). Conclusion and limitations: The research presents evidence on the links between conspiracy beliefs and a range of attitudes and behaviors considered unfavorable from the point of view of individuals and of the society at large. It turned out that different constructs of conspiracy thinking interact with each other. The limitations of the study are discussed in the last part of the article.

"Many countries have governmental fisheries science organizations, each of which should play a critical role in achieving ocean sustainability by leading the fisheries science in each country’s specific contexts and beyond. In the context of the UN Decade of Ocean Science (UNDOS), understanding the interface of science, policy, and public interest around fisheries is increasingly recognized as critically important for realizing effective knowledge exchange and co-creating desired futures. This study aims to illuminate the interface of the above three facets as a guide to have better outcomes in the UNDOS timeframe. We used a case study of Japan – a country with extensive seafood production and consumption, and analyzed 1) the scientific performance of the Japan Fisheries Research and Education Agency (JFRA), a national fisheries research organization in the country through peer-reviewed papers published by JFRA researchers from 2004–2018, 2) policy needs through annual white papers published by Fisheries Agency from 1989–2018, and 3) public interest around fisheries through public inquiry logs accumulated at JFRA from 2004–2018. The results indicated the following: 1) JFRA was originally a part of fisheries policies, and both science and policy were inherently based on the fisheries practices in the “real world” in Japan. However, over the last fifteen years, the scientific performance has heavily focused on bio-physical dimensions of fisheries such areas as “Stock assessment,” “Fisheries Oceanography,” and “Stock enhancement.” 2) Japanese fisheries policy priority has shifted from relatively simple, straightforward keywords focusing on primary fisheries production (from 1989 to 1998) to more complex, multidimensional fisheries systems, including marine resources, producers, processors, and consumers in/outside of the country (from 2009–2018) over the last three decades. 3) Public fisheries/ocean literacy seems limited, despite the rich history of seafood consumption, cultural bond with fisheries, and inherent close relationship among fisheries science, policy, and resource users. Based on the results, we discuss that JFRA sciences, fisheries policy, and the public are contemporary pursuing different interests. To overcome this situation, one important area that JFRA (and any other marine/fisheries research organizations) needs is to reconnect science and public interest through strengthening human dimension works and science communication. For the public side, literacy development among wider stakeholders is one of the most emergent works to be addressed. This is one of the first case studies of science-policy-public interface through empirical data, particularly with the public inquiry log, and the “non-Western” country case study on this topic. This will encourage other empirical studies from countries with various social/cultural/political backgrounds to enrich the perspective of fisheries science-policy-public interface studies globally.

"The article presents the results of research on the absolute chronology of the NiŽná Myšľa cemetery. Due to its scale and location in a key region of the Carpathian Basin, it should be considered one of the most important Early Bronze Age sites in Central Europe. Many years of archaeological research have so far failed to provide adequate data on absolute chronology. This text presents the results of statistical and spatial analyses on a series of newly acquired 14C dates. They allowed us to present a model of the spatial and chronological development of the funerary space and to capture the stage of significant cultural change associated with the adoption of a new raw material - bronze.  © The Author(s), 2022.

"Critical thinking skills are increasingly imperative skills in the nursing profession. Both the Socratic method and nursing theorist philosophy can lead to enhance critical skills. The Socratic method has been rooted in ancient Greek Philosophy, whereas nursing theorist philosophy in the 21st century. This paper discusses critical thinking in the nursing profession and compares the critical thinking concept with the Socratic Method and nurse theorist philosophy. The prime aim of this study is to compare which method is effectively utilized in the nursing profession. The literature pertinent to the topic was searched using the database library, including PubMed, BioMed, Google Scholar, PakMediNet, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature CINAHL. Literature was searched using keywords including Socratic method, nurse theorist philosophy, critical thinking skills, nursing education, and nursing clinical practice. The full-text article was included in the study. Relevant original articles, systemic reviews, quasi-experimental design, philosophical papers, and cross-sectional studies focusing on nurses' critical thinking skills, the Socratic Method, and nurse theorist philosophy were included. The study analysis portrayed Socratic questioning as primarily embedded in critical thinking concepts which nurses utilized in theoretical knowledge. The Socratic Method is explicitly known as the student-centered method that probes critical thinking in classroom teachings. Critical thinking has become vital in professional accountability and excellent nursing care. Nurse theorists have generally employed critical thinking skills to obtain the maximum patient care outcome. In conclusion, the Socratic method increases critical thinking in academia while nursing’s theorist philosophy in nursing clinical practice. © 2023, University of Faisalabad. All rights reserved."
"The chapter proposes to investigate online reputation of hospitality brands and its measurements. Brand reputation is generally defined as an overall appraisal of a company by its stakeholders, which is the result of the company's past actions and predictions about the company's future (Ferguson, Deephouse, & Ferguson, 2000). Being viewed as the opinion shared among a group of stakeholders (Dowling, 2008), it plays an important role in the tourism industry. With the progress of Information Communication Technologies (ICTs), reviews and user-generated contents of destinations and of hospitality companies together with the related emerging brand reputation can influence consumers' behaviors and choices. Brand reputation analysis could be more useful in the hospitality brand management when integrated with brand image and brand identity analysis, mainly because in tourism businesses and destinations, brands are typically affected by an inherent fragility determined by the service nature of products (Casarin, 1996). According to Biel (1991), the meanings that consumers assign to a brand are synthesized into brand associations formed by the components perceived to underlie the brand's image. As well as brand reputation, strong, positive and unique associations reinforce a brand and increase its equity that requires significant internal brand identity efforts, which should create a corresponding brand image through integration in overall marketing programmes (Keller, 2003). It makes sense to develop an analytical research approach that compares online brand reputation (OBR) with brand association matching as a measure of the alignment between brand identity and brand image in hospitality companies. This comparative analysis emerging from brand reputation, brand image and brand identity analysis can reveal divergent situations (i.e., high brand reputation and low brand association matching) and orient brand managers in reviewing online brand communication. Brand reputation and brand image analysis will be contextualized in an online community as a social setting that is considered to be a new type of market (Muniz & O'Guinn, 2001). We focus on hospitality online communities populated by consumers and other actors such as influencers and bloggers: their brand perception could be separately compared with brand identity that we will extract from company communications including presentational information and brand-related press releases found on websites, nonfinancial narrative from annual reports, and interviews with managers published in mainstream media sources. In our analysis we will focalize on a cluster of luxury hospitality companies integrating a netnographic and text-mining techniques. We will use both the techniques in order to (1) extract and study brand associations in terms of brand reputation, brand image, and brand identity; (2) develop indicators of brand reputation and brand association matching; and (3) discuss their utility in the management of the hospitality company brands. © 2023 Silvia Ranfagni and Massimo Rosati.

"Importance: Counseling prior to thyroid cancer (TC) treatment is an essential component of informed consent. An informed patient affects treatment-related expectations and patient engagement, factors that contribute significantly to patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes. Objective: To describe experiences with pretreatment counseling among survivors of TC and to test factors associated with self-reported treatment meeting expectations. Design, Setting, and Participants: A cross-sectional survey was administered between October 18, 2019, and February 8, 2020, to members of ThyCa: Thyroid Cancer Survivors' Association Inc, and to individuals accessing the public-facing ThyCa website. Survey respondents were asked 55 questions, including 4 free-text questions and 2 multiple-choice questions about pretreatment counseling. Main Outcomes and Measures: Respondents self-reported (1) their unmet information needs, (2) rates of treatment meeting expectations, and (3) rates of treatment understanding. A mixed-methods analysis was performed, including qualitative content analysis of free-text responses and multivariable logistic regression of factors associated with self-reported levels of treatment meeting expectations. Results: Of the 1412 survey respondents, 1249 were women (88.4%). The median age at diagnosis was 48 years (range, 18-85 years), and the median age at the time of survey completion was 60 years (range, 18-87 years). A total of 1259 respondents (89.2%) provided free-text responses to the question, ""What would you tell someone newly diagnosed with your same condition?""Of these individuals, 526 (37.2%) reported inadequate pretreatment plan understanding and 578 (40.9%) reported that their treatment experience did not meet their expectations. Treatment met expectations for only 95 respondents (18.1%) reporting an inadequate pretreatment plan understanding. Of the 526 survivors of TC reporting a lack of understanding, 473 (90.0%) provided additional textual comments, most commonly in the categories of postoperative treatment, surveillance, and treatment effects. On multivariable logistic regression, self-reported failure to have an understanding of TC treatment was independently associated with failure of treatment to meet expectations (odds ratio, 5.1 [95% CI, 3.7-6.9]). Patients reporting a full understanding of their treatment plan were 5-fold more likely to indicate that their initial treatment experience was on par with expectations, independent of reported postoperative complications, age, sex, and other potential confounders. Conclusions and Relevance: In this survey study, a substantial proportion of survivors of TC reported inadequate pretreatment understanding. This gap in understanding was associated with high levels of self-reported failure of treatment to meet expectations, which in turn is associated in other studies with poorer patient-reported quality-of-life outcomes. These outcomes may be improved by addressing gaps in patient understanding so expectations more closely match TC diagnosis and treatment pathways..  © 2022 American Medical Association.

"The main problem of translation lies in the method used by the translator. Newmark suggests in theory eight translation methods commonly used by ""human"" translators in translating texts. However, whether this theory also applies to machine translators is a question that this study attempts to answer. More specifically, this study aims to analyze the translation method used by Facebook Auto Translation (FAT) in translating Arabic-Indonesian based on Newmark's V diagram theory. This research is a combination of quantitative and qualitative research. Data mapping was carried out quantitatively, then data analysis was carried out qualitatively, in which the collection, analysis and presentation of data was carried out descriptively.The results showed that by the 58 posts and their translated results analyzed, the researchers found that FAT only applied two of the eight methods proposed by Newmark. The two methods are word-for-word translation and literal translation. A total of 6 translation results (10.34%) are classified as word-for-word translations and 52 translation results (89.66%) are classified as literal translations. The translation method applied by FAT is dominated by literal translation because basically Arabic grammar and Indonesian grammar are different. Arabic has a predicate + subject sentence pattern, although there are also some that have a subject + predicate pattern. Besides that, Arabic also has additional letters or words to verbs which do not have to be translated into Indonesian but must still be in the text because their role is very important in determining meaning. The difference in grammatical structure causes the order of translation to also change so that FAT applies more literal translation methods. © 2023, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved."
"Objective Recent deaths of Indigenous patients in the Canadian healthcare system have been attributed to structural and interpersonal racism. Experiences of interpersonal racism by Indigenous physicians and patients have been well characterised, but the source of this interpersonal bias has not been as well studied. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of explicit and implicit interpersonal anti-Indigenous biases among Albertan physicians. Design and setting This cross-sectional survey measuring demographic information and explicit and implicit anti-Indigenous biases was distributed in September 2020 to all practising physicians in Alberta, Canada. Participants 375 practising physicians with an active medical licence. Outcomes Explicit anti-Indigenous bias, measured by two feeling thermometer methods: participants slid an indicator on a thermometer to indicate their preference for white people (full preference is scored 100) or Indigenous people (full preference, 0), and then participants indicated how favourably they felt toward Indigenous people (100, maximally favourable; 0, maximally unfavourable). Implicit bias was measured using an Indigenous-European implicit association test (negative scores suggest preference for European (white) faces). Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare bias across physician demographics, including intersectional identities of race and gender identity. Main results Most of the 375 participants were white cisgender women (40.3%; n=151). The median age of participants was 46-50 years. 8.3% of participants felt unfavourably toward Indigenous people (n=32 of 375) and 25.0% preferred white people to Indigenous people (n=32 of 128). Median scores did not differ by gender identity, race or intersectional identities. White cisgender men physicians had the greatest implicit preferences compared with other groups (-0.59 (IQR-0.86 to-0.25); n=53; p<0.001). Free-text responses discussed â € reverse racism' and expressed discomfort with survey questions addressing bias and racism. Conclusions Explicit anti-Indigenous bias was present among Albertan physicians. Concerns about â € reverse racism' targeting white people and discomfort discussing racism may act as barriers to addressing these biases. About two-thirds of respondents had implicit anti-Indigenous bias. These results corroborate the validity of patient reports of anti-Indigenous bias in healthcare and emphasise the need for effective intervention.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"Insufficient knowledge of chemical hazards can cause unsafe behaviors, diseases, and accidents in the laboratory, hence educational interventions are significant. Due to its unique qualities, distance learning via educational applications has grown dramatically. This study aimed to determine the efficacy of a safety training intervention via social media applications on the safety knowledge of staff and students at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences. A total of 166 staff and students at the laboratories of schools and research centers affiliated with Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences were randomized to an experimental group and a control group. A training package was prepared including text, GIF, and video messages on the Globally Harmonized System of classification and labeling of Chemicals (GHS), and the experimental group received a one month training via a common messenger platform in Iran (Telegram). Participants' chemical safety knowledge was assessed before and after the intervention. A validated questionnaire including 24 multiple-choice items in text format and 13 multiple-choice items in image format as well as demographic items was employed to collect data. Shapiro-Wilk, independent t test, and analysis of covariance were used to analyze the data. In the textual section of the questionnaire, the most frequently answered item concerned the ""reason for choosing a respirator"", and the least frequently answered ones were ""meaning of warning""and ""meaning of hazard"". Environmental hazard and oxidation risk received the most frequent correct answers in the visual section. After the intervention, the control and experimental groups' knowledge scores were 64.7 ± 10.1 and 79.2 ± 8.4, respectively. According to the covariance test, the training intervention improved participants' knowledge significantly (p < 0.001). Training interventions through social media can improve GHS knowledge. Moreover, visual messages are easier to understand and transfer than textual ones.  © 2023 American Chemical Society."
"Text summarization is a process of generating a concise summary of a given text. It is a popular research topic, and many studies have used sequence-to-sequence deep neural network models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to tackle it. These models consist of two phases: encoding the input text and generating the summary. However, these models may lose information during the encoding phase, particularly when using deep layers, leading to inaccurate summaries. In this paper, we propose a bi-directional LSTM model with a Recurrent Residual Attention mechanism to address this issue. We tested our model on the Amazon Reviews dataset from the Stanford Network Analysis Project and found that it performed better than standard LSTM models and outperformed previous studies.  © 2023 ACM."
"Importance: Rights and access for transgender individuals, including the participation of transgender athletes in sports, have long been debated. These discussions often center around fairness and mental health impacts on youths associated with identity-based inclusion in sports. Objective: To assess the experiences and perspectives of adolescents and young adults on the inclusion of transgender individuals in competitive sports. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this qualitative study, 5 open-ended survey questions were sent to the MyVoice cohort from December 10 to 17, 2021. MyVoice is a nationwide text-message polling platform of US youths aged 14 to 24 years. All coding and subsequent analysis was completed between January 10 and December 11, 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Qualitative perspectives of youths regarding transgender athlete participation in sports as measured by survey responses. Responses were reviewed using an inductive approach to qualitative thematic analysis to develop a codebook. The codes were independently applied to all responses by 2 investigators; discrepancies were resolved with discussion. Summary statistics were calculated for demographic characteristics and code frequencies, and χ2 tests (α =.05, 2-tailed) were used to evaluate differences in opinion based on gender identity and participation in competitive sports. Results: A total of 905 of 1199 youths (75%) responded to the survey. Respondents had a mean (SD) age of 20 (2) years; 482 (53%) identified as male, 29 (3%) identified as transgender, and 306 (34%) reported having participated in high school and/or collegiate athletics. Three themes emerged: (1) youths differed regarding the inclusion of transgender athletes based on gender identity vs sex assigned at birth, (2) many youths did not have personal experience related to the inclusion of transgender athletes, and (3) youths were uncertain about the impacts of gender identity-based participation on cisgender individuals but perceived positive impacts for transgender individuals. Nearly half of respondents (327 of 691 [47%]) thought that transgender athletes should participate based on their gender identity or personal preference, whereas 240 (35%) favored participation based on sex assigned at birth or in a transgender-only category. Respondents mentioned concern about the fairness of identity-based participation, specifically for cisgender women, but many (410 of 697 [59%]) also reported that it would be affirming for transgender athletes to participate based on gender identity. Conclusions and Relevance: The youths in our study differed in their opinions regarding sports participation of transgender youths, but many felt that inclusive policies would affirm and support the mental health of transgender individuals. Negative impacts on fairness were noted by some respondents. These findings suggest that nuanced policies are needed to address the participation of transgender athletes in competitive sports and should consider the impacts on and perspectives of youths most affected..  © 2022 American Medical Association.

"The impact of mega-events on the tourism destinations image (TDI) has a time-series dynamic feature, and the analysis of the inner mechanism is conducive to promoting destination marketing and competitiveness. This paper adopted Python data mining technology and natural language processing technology (NLP) to crawl the travel reviews of well-known domestic travel websites and established a dataset based on long time series and large sample data. The analysis framework is constructed from the “cognitive-emotional-overall” dimensions to explore the temporal change of Zhangjiakou's TDI during the bidding period, preparation period and warm-up period of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. In this way, the potential impact and mechanism of the Winter Olympics on the TDI in a special period and in a specific way can be analyzed. The results show that: (1) The composition elements of Zhangjiakou's TDI are becoming increasingly diversified and the effect of the Winter Olympics is becoming more and more significant. The key degree of ice and snow tourism image under the influence of the Winter Olympics is increasing, and it has experienced the refinement process of changing from vague to concrete image. Positive emotions are becoming more prevalent. (2) The Winter Olympic Games have a progressive influence on the TDI of Zhangjiakou City, which exerts its effect through the construction of tourism experience, the projection of image and the halo effect of brand perception. The Winter Olympics promote product innovation, infrastructure upgrade and service level improvement in Zhangjiakou, which will have a positive impact on the TDI by improving the visitor experience. This paper explores the dynamic impact path of the Games on the changing image of city tourism, which is a guide for host cities to change the TDI through festivals and post-event marketing. © 2023, Science Press.

"Digital literature can become an interesting tool to arouse interest in literary texts among students of Secondary, Baccalaureate and Vocational Training. This article analyses some characteristics of electronic literature that make it attractive to digital natives and that can be of great help in developing reading comprehension skills. Several examples are presented that constitute transpositions of canonical works. This fact favours that they can be used in the classroom as an entrance to the original works. At the end, we suggest the possibility of developing a teaching practice based on the concept of transposition and rewriting for future courses. © GKA Ediciones, authors."
"This study examined published articles concerning sports leadership within the sport psychology domain over the last 30 years using bibliometric analysis that centered on the written content of the publications as unit of analysis in order to explore the intellectual base, particularly the structural relationships among relevant research components about coach leadership. Leximancer version 5.0 (Leximancer Pty Ltd.) was used to extract data from 100 sports leadership-related articles from four sport psychology journals. Overall, the most relevant concepts generated were coaches (100%) and athletes (59%), followed by study, sport, support, and motivation, and behaviors. Also, relevant concepts produced for each journal were quite similar which included coaches, athletes, behaviors, study, support and team. Further, publications related to coach leadership have shown a steady growth rate since 1990 with 76% of all published articles were conducted via quantitative research method. Finally, United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Belgium were the top countries involved in the area of coach leadership. Coach leadership studies generally focus on behaviors and perceptions related to the coach and relationships between leadership and psychological outcomes. Each journal has a similar but distinct rationale when publishing papers about coach leadership. Bibliometric analysis can be applied as an alternative methodology to summarize large volumes of relevant data in order to map the current knowledge as well as identify potential future research directions.

"Background: 'Neurodisability' refers to a group of conditions that result primarily from a neurological problem (e.g. cerebral palsy), neuromuscular problem (e.g. a muscular dystrophy) or developmental problems (e.g. developmental impairment, Down syndrome). Children and young people with these conditions may have similar problems with mobility, feeding and airway clearance. Chest and breathing problems (including pulmonary infections) are commonly experienced by children and young people with neurodisabilities and are often a cause for them requiring hospital care. For those who are unable to completely clear their airway of secretions, or have frequent infections, pulmonary infections may not be able to be completely eradicated and therefore become chronic. It is unclear what treatment is best for children and young people in this position. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of antibiotic treatment for chronic pulmonary infection in children and young people living with a neurodisability, including quality-of-life measures, effects on hospitalisation and healthcare contacts. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group Register of Trials (CARIGRT), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), OpenGrey (www.opengrey.eu) and three trials registries up to 8 February 2022. Additionally, we identified related systematic reviews through Epistemonikos.org (8 February 2022) and searched reference lists of these. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials of antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection in children and young people up to the age of 18 living with a neurodisability were eligible. Data collection and analysis: Two independent review authors screened results of the searches against predetermined inclusion criteria, resolving any discrepancies by discussion. Main results: We identified a total of 1968 independent records through our searches, of which we assessed six full-text articles for eligibility. We identified one ongoing study as well as one related substudy but did not identify any completed studies eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. Authors' conclusions: The findings of this systematic review highlight a lack of evidence in the antibiotic treatment of chronic pulmonary infection in children and young people up to the age of 18 living with a neurodisability. Further research examining this topic is therefore required. Copyright © 2023 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Background: Cognitive impairment is one of the common sequelae after stroke, which not only hinders the recovery of patients but also increases the financial burden on families. In the absence of effective therapeutic measures, acupuncture treatment has been widely used in China to treat post-stroke cognitive impairment (PSCI), but the specific efficacy is unclear. Therefore, this review aimed to evaluate the true efficacy of acupuncture treatment in patients with PSCI. Methods: We searched eight databases [PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), China Science and Technology Journal (VIP) database, the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database, and Wan fang database] from the inception to May 2022 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) related to acupuncture treatment combined with cognitive rehabilitation (CR) for PSCI. Two investigators independently used a pre-designed form to extract valid data from eligible RCTs. The risk of bias was assessed through tools provided by the Cochrane Collaboration. The meta-analysis was implemented through Rev Man software (version 5.4). The strength of the evidence obtained was evaluated using GRADE profiler software. Adverse events (AEs) were collected by reading the full text and used to evaluate the safety of acupuncture treatment. Results: Thirty-eight studies involving a total of 2,971 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, the RCTs included in this meta-analysis were poor in methodological quality. The combined results showed that acupuncture treatment combined with CR showed significant superiority compared to CR alone in terms of improving cognitive function [Mean Difference (MD) = 3.94, 95% confidence intervals (CI): 3.16–4.72, P < 0.00001 (MMSE); MD = 3.30, 95%CI: 2.53–4.07, P < 0.00001 (MoCA); MD = 9.53, 95%CI: 5.61–13.45, P < 0.00001 (LOTCA)]. Furthermore, the combination of acupuncture treatment and CR significantly improved patients' self-care ability compared to CR alone [MD = 8.66, 95%CI: 5.85–11.47, P < 0.00001 (MBI); MD = 5.24, 95%CI: 3.90–6.57, P < 0.00001 (FIM)]. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis showed that MMSE scores were not sufficiently improved in the comparison of electro-acupuncture combined with CR versus CR alone (MD = 4.07, 95%CI: −0.45–8.60, P = 0.08). However, we also observed that electro-acupuncture combined with CR was superior to the use of CR alone in improving MoCA and MBI scores in patients with PSCI [MD = 2.17, 95%CI: 0.65–3.70, P = 0.005 (MoCA); MD = 1.74, 95%CI: 0.13–3.35, P = 0.03 (MBI)]. There was no significant difference in the occurrence of adverse events (AE) between acupuncture treatment combined with CR and CR alone (P > 0.05). The certainty of the evidence was rated low level because of flaws in the study design and considerable heterogeneity among the included studies. Conclusion: This review found that acupuncture treatment combined with CR may have a positive effect on improving cognitive function and self-care ability in PSCI patients. However, our findings should be treated with caution owing to the existence of methodological quality issues. High-quality studies are urgently required to validate our results in the future.

"The sentiment analysis task is more complex considering the lack of relevant information in brief texts. Deep neural networks, like as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have been widely employed to extract information from data sentiment in recent years, with surprisingly good results. Though CNN can efficiently retrieve comparatively high features employing convolution and max-pooling layers, it cannot understand relationships' sequences. Parallelly bidirectional RNN models can extract contextual information and fail to extract local features. In this paper, integrated CNN and RNN models for sentiment analysis are examined to have the advantages of CNN's coarse grain local feature extraction and long-distance dependencies of RNNs. Particularly bidirectional LSTM and GRU networks associated with the convolution and max-pooling layer are used for sentiment analysis in SST-2 and movie review datasets. Two pre-trained word embedding techniques glove and word2vec are used. Experimental findings show that max performance is achieved at 93.44% for SST-2 and 95.42% for the movie review dataset using CNN BiGRU word2vec and CNN BiGRU glove, respectively. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

"This research aimed to know cadets' speaking abilities through retelling a recount text of shipping project experiences and knowing the importance of recount text of shipping project experiences in cadets' speaking abilities and learning process. This thesis's research design was descriptive qualitative, investigating the recount text of shipping project experiences used by cadets of PIP Makassar. The research site of this research was at PIP Makassar, which is undergone by the ministry of transportation of Indonesia. There were two data resources. The primary resource was 7th-semester cadets of PIP Makassar and four Maritime English lecturers as respondents of the research. The secondary resource was some literature related to speaking abilities and recounting text. The technique of data analyzes was data collection of recording using Miles and Hubberman data analysis, data collected from field notes, data collected from the interview, and data gathered from the questionnaire. The results of this research showed that the cadets' speaking abilities of recount text of shipping project experiences were categorized as average means accepted but not bad learners based on Brown's (2004) theory of speaking abilities. It was shown in the findings and the discussion. It was also shown from the result of the interview with the Maritime English teachers that it was essential to teach recount text of shipping project experiences in the learning process. It was also stated from the questionnaire distributed through google form to the cadets that 75% of cadets chose retelling shipping project experiences was important. It showed that 10% of cadets chose retelling shipping project experiences was very important, and 15% of cadets chose retelling shipping project experiences was not that important.  © 2023 Author(s)."
"Gas hydrates represent one of the main flow assurance challenges in the oil and gas industry as they can lead to plugging of pipelines and process equipment. In this paper we present a literature study performed to evaluate the current state of the use of machine learning methods within the field of gas hydrates with specific focus on the oil chemistry. A common analysis technique for crude oils is Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) which could be a good approach to achieving a better understanding of the chemical composition of hydrates, and the use of machine learning in the field of FT-ICR MS was therefore also examined. Several machine learning methods were identified as promising, their use in the literature was reviewed and a text analysis study was performed to identify the main topics within the publications. The literature search revealed that the publications on the combination of FT-ICR MS, machine learning and gas hydrates is limited to one. Most of the work on gas hydrates is related to thermodynamics, while FT-ICR MS is mostly used for chemical analysis of oils. However, with the combination of FT-ICR MS and machine learning to evaluate samples related to gas hydrates, it could be possible to improve the understanding of the composition of hydrates and thereby identify hydrate active compounds responsible for the differences between oils forming plugging hydrates and oils forming transportable hydrates. © 2022 The Authors"
"Density functional theory was used to elucidate the reaction mechanism of Cp*IrIII-catalyzed intermolecular regioselective C(sp3)-H amidation of alkenes with methyl dioxazolones. All substrates, intermediates, and transition states were fully optimized at the ωB97XD/6-31G(d,p) level (LANL2DZ(f) for Ir). The computational results revealed that this amidation occurred through the IrIII/IrV catalytic cycle, involving four important elementary steps: C-H bond activation, oxidative addition of methyl dioxazolone, reductive elimination, and proto-demetalation, and the first was the rate-determining step. The C-H bond activation showed good α- and branch-regioselectivity, decided by the distortion energy of 2-pentene and the interaction energy of the transition state, respectively. The oxidative addition of dioxazolone occurred in one elementary step with CO2 disassociation. The reductive elimination showed good branch-regioselectivity determined by the distorted energy of the allyl group. In the proto-demetalation, hydrogen directly transferred from the oxygen atom to the nitrogen atom. Moreover, to clarify the effect of the substituted groups, selected 12 substrates were also discussed in this text. © 2023 American Chemical Society."
"A destination's ability to attract tourists is associated with the visitor experience and, in recent years, visitors have increasingly used virtual environments and digital innovation, such as social media platforms, to communicate their experience of tourist destinations. A positive well-communicated tourist experience improves the reputation of the destination and has relevant consequences for both the destination's attractiveness and its competitive advantage. On the contrary, when the destination's reputation is negatively affected by visitors' experiences, comments and reviews, such destination might compromise its ability to attract new visitors. Studies in this field agree alike that the tourist experience is negatively affected by overcrowding and overflows phenomena occurring around the visited city attractions. The present research, merging the aforementioned observations, investigates whether visitor density affects the online reputation of the Uffizi Gallery, estimated by extracting visitors' opinions and feedbacks on the city's main attractions from TripAdvisor ratings and from Twitter posts, by applying sentiment analysis to evaluate whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral. The city of Florence is an ideal case study, as the city records almost 16 million tourist overnight stays per year hence highly exposed to the risk of tourist overcrowding and overflows. The research findings reveal that Uffizi Gallery experiences and mood are influenced by the number of visitors insisting and if tourists live a negative experience, this is further exacerbated by the growing density of visitors themselves. We find that, if tourists have a negative experience, this is exacerbated by the density of visitors to the Uffizi Gallery. The results reveal also that tourists' experiences are even more influenced by any general dissatisfaction they experience in the city of Florence in a broader way. Practical implications and theoretical contributions are discussed. © 2023 Camilla Ciappei, Giovanni Liberatore, Paolo Nesi, Gianni Pantaleo, Alessandro Monti and Micaela Surchi.

"Introduction Discharging older adults with frailty home from the emergency department (ED) poses unique challenges due to multiple interacting physical and social problems. Paramedic supportive discharge services help overcome these challenges by adding in-home assessment and/or interventions. Our objective is to describe existing paramedic programmes designed to support discharge from the ED or hospital to avoid unnecessary hospital admissions. A comprehensive description of paramedic supportive discharge services will be conducted by mapping the literature to describe: (1) why such programmes are needed; (2) who is being targeted, making referrals and delivering the services and (3) what assessments and interventions are offered. Methods and analysis We will include studies that focus on expanded paramedic roles (community paramedicine) and extended scope postdischarge from the ED or hospital. All study designs will be included with no limit by language. We will include peer-reviewed articles and preprints and a targeted search of grey literature from January 2000 to June 2022. The proposed scoping review will be conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology. We will use a search strategy designed by a health science librarian to search MEDLINE All (Ovid), CINAHL Full Text (EBSCO), Embase (Elsevier) and Scopus (Elsevier) for eligible studies from 2000 to present. Two independent reviewers will conduct screening and full-text review. Data extraction will be conducted by one reviewer and verified by another. We will report our findings descriptively by charting trends in the research. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics review is not required as this is a scoping review comprised published studies. The results of this research will be published in a manuscript and presented at national and international geriatric and emergency medicine conferences. This research will inform future implementation studies on community paramedic supportive discharge services.

"Background: Vascular surgery may be followed by internal bleeding due to inadequate surgical haemostasis, abnormal clotting, or surgical complications. Bleeding ranges from minor, with no transfusion requirement, to massive, requiring multiple blood product transfusions. There are a number of drugs, given systemically or applied locally, which may reduce the need for blood transfusion. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of anti-fibrinolytic and haemostatic drugs and agents in reducing bleeding and the need for blood transfusion in people undergoing major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe (> 500 mL) blood loss. Search methods: We searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE; Embase; CINAHL, and Transfusion Evidence Library. We also searched the WHO ICTRP and ClinicalTrials.gov trial registries for ongoing and unpublished trials. Searches used a combination of MeSH and free text terms from database inception to 31 March 2022, without restriction on language or publication status. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in adults of drug treatments to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery or vascular procedures with a risk of moderate or severe blood loss, which used placebo, usual care or another drug regimen as control. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were units of red cells transfused and all-cause mortality. Our secondary outcomes included risk of receiving an allogeneic blood product, risk of reoperation or repeat procedure due to bleeding, risk of a thromboembolic event, risk of a serious adverse event and length of hospital stay. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. Main results: We included 22 RCTs with 3393 participants analysed, of which one RCT with 69 participants was reported only in abstract form, with no usable data. Seven RCTs evaluated systemic drug treatments (three aprotinin, two desmopressin, two tranexamic acid) and 15 RCTs evaluated topical drug treatments (drug-containing bioabsorbable dressings or glues), including fibrin, thrombin, collagen, gelatin, synthetic sealants and one investigational new agent. Most trials were conducted in high-income countries and the majority of the trials only included participants undergoing elective surgery. We also identified two ongoing RCTs. We were unable to perform the planned network meta-analysis due to the sparse reporting of outcomes relevant to this review. Systemic drug treatments. We identified seven trials of three systemic drugs: aprotinin, desmopressin and tranexamic acid, all with placebo controls. The trials of aprotinin and desmopressin were small with very low-certainty evidence for all of our outcomes. Tranexamic acid versus placebo was the systemic drug comparison with the largest number of participants (2 trials; 1460 participants), both at low risk of bias. The largest of these included a total of 9535 individuals undergoing a number of different higher risk surgeries and reported limited information on the vascular subgroup (1399 participants). Neither trial reported the number of units of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days. Three outcomes were associated with very low-certainty evidence due to the very wide confidence intervals (CIs) resulting from small study sizes and low number of events. These were: all-cause mortality up to 30 days; number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days; and risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding. Tranexamic acid may have no effect on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days (risk ratio (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.36; 1 trial, 1360 participants; low-certainty evidence due to imprecision). There is one large ongoing trial (8320 participants) comparing tranexamic acid versus placebo in people undergoing non-cardiac surgery who are at high risk of requiring a red cell transfusion. This aims to complete recruitment in April 2023. This trial has primary outcomes of proportion of participants transfused with red blood cells and incidence of venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE). Topical drug treatments. Most trials of topical drug treatments were at high risk of bias due to their open-label design (compared with usual care, or liquids were compared with sponges). All of the trials were small, most were very small, and few reported clinically relevant outcomes in the postoperative period. Fibrin sealant versus usual care was the topical drug comparison with the largest number of participants (5 trials, 784 participants). The five trials that compared fibrin sealant with usual care were all at high risk of bias, due to the open-label trial design with no measures put in place to minimise reporting bias. All of the trials were funded by pharmaceutical companies. None of the five trials reported the number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days. The other three outcomes were associated with very low-certainty evidence with wide confidence intervals due to small sample sizes and the low number of events, these were: all-cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure due to bleeding; and risk of thromboembolic disease up to 30 days. We identified one large trial (500 participants) comparing fibrin sealant versus usual care in participants undergoing abdominal aortic aneurysm repair, which has not yet started recruitment. This trial lists death due to arterial disease and reintervention rates as primary outcomes. Authors' conclusions: Because of a lack of data, we are uncertain whether any systemic or topical treatments used to reduce bleeding due to major vascular surgery have an effect on: all-cause mortality up to 30 days; risk of requiring a repeat procedure or operation due to bleeding; number of red cells transfused per participant up to 30 days or the number of participants requiring an allogeneic blood transfusion up to 30 days. There may be no effect of tranexamic acid on the risk of thromboembolic events up to 30 days, this is important as there has been concern that this risk may be increased. Trials with sample size targets of thousands of participants and clinically relevant outcomes are needed, and we look forward to seeing the results of the ongoing trials in the future.

Because of their constant availability on the network, Android apps are easily attacked by URL-based traffic. In this paper, an Android malware classification and detection approach using deep and broad URL feature mining is proposed. This study entails the development of a novel traffic data preprocessing and transformation method that can detect malicious apps using network traffic analysis. The encrypted URL-based traffic is mined to decrypt the transmitted data. To extract the sequenced features, the N-gram analysis method is used, and afterward, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method is utilized to reduce the features while preserving the actual semantics. The latent features are extracted using the latent semantic analysis tool. Finally, CNN-LSTM, a multi-view deep learning approach, is designed for effective malware classification and detection.

"Introduction In 2019, there were 2.5 million reported cases of chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in the USA, young people aged 15-24 made up 61% and 42% of chlamydia and gonorrhoea cases, respectively. Moreover, the highest rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) were reported among college-aged students. In this paper, we outline our protocol to systematically review the published literature on, the use of STI/HIV self-test kits, increasing STI/HIV testing uptake, and stigma, access and confidentiality issues, among young adult college students in the USA. Methods and analysis This scoping review will be conducted and reported according to the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews. We will search electronic databases, OVID Medline, OVID Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, PubMed and CINAHL, for articles published in English from inception to the present. We will search other alternative sources such as ProQuest, Google Scholar and Google to identify grey literature. A two-step process will be used to identify eligible studies based on the defined inclusion criteria. First, the title and abstract of identified articles will be screened for possible inclusion. Second, full-text articles of relevant studies will be retrieved and screened for inclusion. Both screening steps will be done by two people independently. Finally, data will be extracted by two researchers working independently. Any arising disagreements will be resolved by consensus or by a third author. Ethics and dissemination This study is a scoping review of the literature. Therefore, ethics approval is not required. Our plan for the dissemination of findings includes peer-reviewed manuscripts, conferences and webinars.  © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group. All rights reserved."
"Importance: Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare and underdiagnosed genetic disease characterized by painful sensitivity to light. A better understanding and characterization of its light-induced cutaneous symptoms may aid in the identification of EPP in patients. Objectives: To describe the cutaneous symptoms of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and to determine if these symptoms are associated with the degree of light sensitivity. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a cross-sectional study of adolescent and adult (≥15 years) patients with EPP across the US conducted by a single academic hospital via a remotely administered survey, measurements of light sensitivity by light dosimetry and by text message symptom assessments. Data analyses were conducted from November 2020 to April 2022. Exposures: Sunlight exposure. Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-reported symptoms and association with measured light sensitivity. Results: The study sample consisted of 35 patients with EPP (mean [SD] age, 39.1 (15.5) years; 21 [60%] female; 14 [40%] male; 35 [100%] White individuals). The patients' median [range] skin tone was 3.0 (1.0-8.0), based on self-reporting from 1 (lightest) to 12 (darkest). A total of 24 participants completed the light dosimeter measurements. Phototoxic reactions were characterized by pain (97%; 34 patients), burning (97%; 34), tingling (97%; 34), pruritus (83%; 29), allodynia (89%; 31), improvement of symptoms with cold (89%; 31), achiness (24%; 12), fatigue (46%; 16), mild swelling (83%; 29), severe swelling (63%; 22), erythema (51%; 18), petechiae (40%; 14), skin cracking (43%; 15), scabbing (46%; 16), scarring (66%; 23), and other chronic skin changes (40%; 14). Patients with EPP reported that their hands, feet, and face were most sensitive to light and that their shoulders and legs were least sensitive; 25.7% (9 patient) reported no chronic skin changes, and 5.7% (2 patients) reported never having had any visible symptoms. None of these findings varied with the degree of light sensitivity except that lower overall light sensitivity was associated with lower ranked sensitivity of the neck and arms. Conclusions and Relevance: The findings of this cross-sectional study suggest that patients with EPP have distinctive cutaneous symptoms that may aid in identification of this underdiagnosed disease. Characteristic EPP symptoms include light-induced cutaneous burning pain and occasional swelling, particularly over the hands, with a prodrome of pruritus and paresthesias. Minimal skin changes or the absence of visible skin changes during reactions to light, including lack of erythema, do not exclude an EPP diagnosis nor suggest low EPP disease burden.. © 2023 American Medical Association.

"The article analyzes the works of authors who served exile in Vologda in 1902. The research material is text fragments in which the language, speech, and style of a person are comprehended. We have attracted texts published after 1902. In our opinion, it is in works remote in time that the manifestation of reflection on communication is a trace of existentially saturated direct contact. The article deals with the works of former exiles who were once in Vologda at the same time. Therefore, the fragments involved in the study acquire the status of reference points for describing the experience of a “forced conversation” that occurred in their lives. The methods of Russian linguistics (description, continuous sampling, contextual analysis, comparison) and philosophy (reconstruction) are used in the work. The leading methodological strategy is the interpretation of the text. We were able to establish that eleven people (P.E. Shchegolev, N.A. Berdyaev, I.E. Ermolaev, V.A. Rusanov, P.L. Tuchapsky, A.M. Remizov, O.A. Kvitkin, S.A. Suvorov, B.V. Savinkov, A.V. Lunacharsky, A.A. Bogdanov) comprehended their communication in the works published after the “Vologda exile”. This fact can be explained neither by the education received, nor by the unity of scientific interests, nor by the commonality of philosophical grounds. This is not a coincidence, not an accident, it is the experience of a “forced conversation” experienced simultaneously in 1902. © 2023, Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences.

"The usage of social media, forums, and e-commerce websites have been widely increased. Feedback from customers has a big impact on the final product. A service provider, merchant, or manufacturer need all the information, even if it is just a comment or a review about a service or a product. So, it is vital to look at input from users, and therefore sentiment analysis has received a lot of interest. Sentiment analysis is a method for identifying and analyzing text in order to determine the features, qualities, and viewpoints of particular user. Extracting user aspects is the main part of this process, and it is used to group the user aspects. In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) models have gained popularity in natural language processing. Thus, this research proposes a novel hybrid CNN model by concatenating the bidirectional long short-term memory and CNN models to process the data sequentially by learning their high-level features. The concatenated method minimizes the loss of critical information. Benchmark product reviews and hotel review datasets are employed in the experiments, and accuracies of 93.6% for the product review dataset and 92.7% for the hotel review dataset are achieved by the proposed hybrid model when compared to state-of-the-art techniques. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

"Background: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is characterised by neurovascular degeneration as a result of chronic hyperglycaemia. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most serious complication of DR and can lead to total (central and peripheral) visual loss. PDR is characterised by the presence of abnormal new blood vessels, so-called “new vessels,” at the optic disc (NVD) or elsewhere in the retina (NVE). PDR can progress to high-risk characteristics (HRC) PDR (HRC-PDR), which is defined by the presence of NVD more than one-fourth to one-third disc area in size plus vitreous haemorrhage or pre-retinal haemorrhage, or vitreous haemorrhage or pre-retinal haemorrhage obscuring more than one disc area. In severe cases, fibrovascular membranes grow over the retinal surface and tractional retinal detachment with sight loss can occur, despite treatment. Although most, if not all, individuals with diabetes will develop DR if they live long enough, only some progress to the sight-threatening PDR stage. Objectives: To determine risk factors for the development of PDR and HRC-PDR in people with diabetes and DR. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2022, Issue 5), Ovid MEDLINE, and Ovid Embase. The date of the search was 27 May 2022. Additionally, the search was supplemented by screening reference lists of eligible articles. There were no restrictions to language or year of publication. Selection criteria: We included prospective or retrospective cohort studies and case-control longitudinal studies evaluating prognostic factors for the development and progression of PDR, in people who have not had previous treatment for DR. The target population consisted of adults (≥18 years of age) of any gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and geographical location, with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) or PDR with less than HRC-PDR, diagnosed as per standard clinical practice. Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and full-text articles, to determine eligibility; discrepancies were resolved through discussion. We considered prognostic factors measured at baseline and any other time points during the study and in any clinical setting. Outcomes were evaluated at three and eight years (± two years) or lifelong. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data from included studies using a data extraction form that we developed and piloted prior to the data collection stage. We resolved any discrepancies through discussion. We used the Quality in Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool to assess risk of bias. We conducted meta-analyses in clinically relevant groups using a random-effects approach. We reported hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and risk ratios (RR) separately for each available prognostic factor and outcome, stratified by different time points. Where possible, we meta-analysed adjusted prognostic factors. We evaluated the certainty of the evidence with an adapted version of the GRADE framework. Main results: We screened 6391 records. From these, we identified 59 studies (87 articles) as eligible for inclusion. Thirty-five were prospective cohort studies, 22 were retrospective studies, 18 of which were cohort and six were based on data from electronic registers, and two were retrospective case-control studies. Twenty-three studies evaluated participants with type 1 diabetes (T1D), 19 with type 2 diabetes (T2D), and 17 included mixed populations (T1D and T2D). Studies on T1D included between 39 and 3250 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 45 years. Studies on T2D included between 100 and 71,817 participants at baseline, followed up for one to 20 years. The studies on mixed populations of T1D and T2D ranged from 76 to 32,553 participants at baseline, followed up for four to 25 years. We found evidence indicating that higher glycated haemoglobin (haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)) levels (adjusted OR ranged from 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.32) to 2.10 (95% CI 1.64 to 2.69) and more advanced stages of retinopathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.38 (95% CI 1.29 to 1.48) to 12.40 (95% CI 5.31 to 28.98) are independent risk factors for the development of PDR in people with T1D and T2D. We rated the evidence for these factors as of moderate certainty because of moderate to high risk of bias in the studies. There was also some evidence suggesting several markers for renal disease (for example, nephropathy (adjusted OR ranged from 1.58 (95% CI not reported) to 2.68 (2.09 to 3.42), and creatinine (adjusted meta-analysis HR 1.61 (95% CI 0.77 to 3.36)), and, in people with T1D, age at diagnosis of diabetes (< 12 years of age) (standardised regression estimate 1.62, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.48), increased triglyceride levels (adjusted RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.95), and larger retinal venular diameters (RR 4.28, 95% CI 1.50 to 12.19) may increase the risk of progression to PDR. The certainty of evidence for these factors, however, was low to very low, due to risk of bias in the included studies, inconsistency (lack of studies preventing the grading of consistency or variable outcomes), and imprecision (wide CIs). There was no substantial and consistent evidence to support duration of diabetes, systolic or diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low- (LDL) and high- (HDL) density lipoproteins, gender, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), socioeconomic status, or tobacco and alcohol consumption as being associated with incidence of PDR. There was insufficient evidence to evaluate prognostic factors associated with progression of PDR to HRC-PDR. Authors' conclusions: Increased HbA1c is likely to be associated with progression to PDR; therefore, maintaining adequate glucose control throughout life, irrespective of stage of DR severity, may help to prevent progression to PDR and risk of its sight-threatening complications. Renal impairment in people with T1D or T2D, as well as younger age at diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (DM), increased triglyceride levels, and increased retinal venular diameters in people with T1D may also be associated with increased risk of progression to PDR. Given that more advanced DR severity is associated with higher risk of progression to PDR, the earlier the disease is identified, and the above systemic risk factors are controlled, the greater the chance of reducing the risk of PDR and saving sight.

"Background: Increasing depression patients puts great pressure on clinical diagnosis. Audio-based diagnosis is a helpful auxiliary tool for early mass screening. However, current methods consider only speech perception features, ignoring patients' vocal tract changes, which may partly result in the poor recognition. Methods: This work proposes a novel machine speech chain model for depression recognition (MSCDR) that can capture text-independent depressive speech representation from the speaker's mouth to the listener's ear to improve recognition performance. In the proposed MSCDR, linear predictive coding (LPC) and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) features are extracted to describe the processes of speech generation and of speech perception, respectively. Then, a one-dimensional convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory network sequentially capture intra- and inter-segment dynamic depressive features for classification. Results: We tested the MSCDR on two public datasets with different languages and paradigms, namely, the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of Oz and the Multi-modal Open Dataset for Mental-disorder Analysis. The accuracy of the MSCDR on the two datasets was 0.77 and 0.86, and the average F1 score was 0.75 and 0.86, which were better than the other existing methods. This improvement reveals the complementarity of speech production and perception features in carrying depressive information. Limitations: The sample size was relatively small, which may limit the application in clinical translation to some extent. Conclusion: This experiment proves the good generalization ability and superiority of the proposed MSCDR and suggests that the vocal tract changes in patients with depression deserve attention for audio-based depression diagnosis. © 2022"
"This book is a pragma-stylistic study of Ian McEwan's fiction, providing a qualitative analysis of his selected novels using (im)politeness theory. (Im)politeness is investigated on two levels of analysis: the level of the plot and the story world (intradiegetic level) and the level of the communication between the implied author and implied reader in fiction (extradiegetic level). The pragmatic theory of (im)politeness serves the aim of internal characterisation and helps readers to better understand and explain the characters' motivations and actions, based on the stylistic analysis of their speech and thoughts and point of view. More importantly, the book introduces the notion of ""the impoliteness of the literary fiction"" - a state of affairs where the implied author (or narrator) expresses their impolite beliefs to the reader through the text, which has face-threatening consequences for the audience, e.g. moral shock or disgust, dissociation from the protagonist, feeling hurt or 'put out'. Extradiegetic impoliteness, one of the key characteristics of McEwan's fiction, offers an alternative to the literary concept of ""a secret communion of the author and reader"" (Booth 1961), describing an ideal connection, or good rapport, between these two participants of fictional communication. This book aims to unite literary scholars and linguists in the debate on the benefits of combining pragmatics and stylistics in literary analysis, and it will be of interest to a wide audience in both fields. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

"This chapter examines the reactions of Italian, Spanish, French and German citizens through the comments left on Twitter. Italy, Spain, France and Germany were the first four European nations to be affected by the virus and to implement measures to contain the contagion such as the lockdown. Through the merged method of Emotional text mining, citizens' reactions are clustered and sentiment analysis is carried out on them. The tweets reveal a concern for the crisis that is not only health, but also economic, political and social. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023. All rights reserved."
"Target sentiment analysis aims to analyze the sentiment tendency corresponding to different targets in the review text. At present, graph neural network based methods use the dependency syntactic tree to incorporate dependency syntactic relations. On the one hand, these methods mostly ignore the fact that dependency relations lack distinction. On the other hand, without considering the dependency relations provided by the dependency syntactic tree, there is a lack of relations between target and sentiment words. Therefore, a dual graph attention network(DGAT) model is proposed. First, the model uses a bidirectional long short-term memory network to obtain word node representation with semantic information, and then constructs a syntactic graph attention network based on the word node representation according to the dependency syntactic tree, so as to distinguish the importance of dependency syntactic relations, more effectively establish the relation between target and sentiment words, and obtain a more accurate representation of target sentiment features. At the same time, according to the undirected complete graph of sentences,a global graph attention network is used to mine lacking relations between target and sentiment words,50 as to further improve the performance of the model. Experimental resul show that compared with existing models, the DGAT model has a better accuracy and macro-average F1 value on different datasets. © 2023 Science Press. All rights reserved."
"Importance: Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is usually curable; however, a subset of patients develops poor outcomes, including local recurrence, nodal metastasis, distant metastasis, and disease-specific death. Objectives: To evaluate all evidence-based reports of patient risk factors and tumor characteristics associated with poor outcomes in primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and to identify treatment modalities that minimize poor outcomes. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, and SCOPUS databases were searched for studies of the topic in humans, published in the English language, from database inception through February 8, 2022. Study Selection: Two authors independently screened the identified articles and included those that were original research with a sample size of 10 patients or more and that assessed risk factors and/or treatment modalities associated with poor outcomes among patients with primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Data extraction was performed by a single author, per international guidelines. The search terms, study objectives, and protocol methods were defined before study initiation. A total of 310 studies were included for full-text assessment. Owing to heterogeneity of the included studies, a random-effects model was used. Data analyses were performed from May 25 to September 15, 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: For studies of risk factors, risk ratios and incidence proportions; and for treatment studies, incidence proportions. Results: In all, 129 studies and a total of 137449 patients with primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and 126553 tumors were included in the meta-analysis. Several patient risk factors and tumor characteristics were associated with local recurrence, nodal metastasis, distant metastasis, disease-specific death, and all-cause death were identified. Among all factors reported by more than 1 study, the highest risks for local recurrence and disease-specific death were associated with tumor invasion beyond subcutaneous fat (risk ratio, 9.1 [95% CI, 2.8-29.2] and 10.4 [95% CI, 3.0- 36.3], respectively), and the highest risk of any metastasis was associated with perineural invasion (risk ratio, 5.0; 95% CI, 2.3-11.1). Patients who received Mohs micrographic surgery had the lowest incidence of nearly all poor outcomes; however, in some results, the 95% CIs overlapped with those of other treatment modalities. Conclusions and Relevance: This meta-analysis identified the prognostic value of several risk factors and the effectiveness of the available treatment modalities. These findings carry important implications for the prognostication, workup, treatment, and follow-up of patients with primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

"Situated within the field of women 's photographic practice, this chapter investigates the relationship between trauma, memory, and the embodied trace. Using practice examples, the text explores how self-performed modes of self-representation might offer insights into the complex-psychological and physiological-inscriptions left by trauma. Evaluating this relationship, the text draws on analyses by Griselda Pollock, Jill Bennett, and Margaret Iversen. The argument supports post-qualitative research methods that unfold subjective material through the 'doing-thinking-making' process. Approached through posthuman and new materialist frameworks referencing Karen Barad and Rosi Braidotti, the chapter examines how a diffractive-rather than purely reflective-methodology can synthesise praxis and theory through affective photographic outcomes. The chapter concludes by evaluating how a diffractive approach to photographic self-representation can be productive for re-thinking the self, re-interpreting narratives of trauma, and re-imagining the way we see ourselves in our 'becoming-with' others. © 2023 by IGI Global.

"Sentiment Analysis (SA) has recently gained great interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP). In fact, NLP consists in extracting data from texts and categorizing certain tweets as Positive, Negative, or Neutral. In this paper, we also present our participation in the Arabic Sentiment Analysis Challenge organized by King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). Data of interest are tweets written in Arabic language, which becomes more challengeable. In this manuscript, we present the introduced system and the bi-LSTM model. Also, detail the less efficient explored solutions. Our main objective is to extract the crucial semantic data in Arabic tweets. The obtained findings about Arabic twitter corpus reveal that the performance of the developed technique is better than that proposed in the literature.

"This article investigates how translators choose between multiple competing onomasiological variants to express (verbal) inchoativity in English-to-Dutch translations. Using a corpus-based multifactorial research design, we measure the impact of three well-known socio-cognitive mechanisms on the actual choice, namely the complexity principle, risk aversion, and cognate exposure. We apply the behavioural profile method, which allows us to operationalise these three explanatory mechanisms via ID-tags, and we then use conditional random forest modelling to determine the impact of each mechanism on the choice between four competing verbs of inchoativity. The results of our analyses show that the complexity principle plays a clear role in translated texts, as there is a significant preference for the active construction and for prototypical verbs in passive constructions. Genre-specific risk-averse behaviour as well as cognate avoidance were not observed. © John Benjamins Publishing Company."
"One of the important indicators of increasing the capacity of the health system and the chances of survival of patients and injured immediately after chemical, biological, radiation and nuclear (CBRN) accidents is rapid access to medical services. Establishing prehospital health response teams is one of the main strategies to improve the capacity and ability to respond to unusual events. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors influencing the formation of rapid response teams in the field of health in response to chemical, biological, radiation and nuclear accidents (CBRN EDMRT). In this study, the comparative review method was used. The study period was from November 1, 2021 to March 2022. Forming and deploying rapid health response teams based on an extensive multi-step search and keywords in multiple databases such as PubMed, CINHAL, Blackwell, Iranmedex, SID, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Google Scholar, Scopus Also, the websites of the Ministry of Health and the responsible organizations in different countries and the proposed structure were done by international institutions and sites. After accessing the resources and documents, the process of analysis and comparison of different team structures was performed. After the initial search, the structure and required elements of their teams were extracted. According to published articles and texts, 10 teams from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US Department of Homeland Security, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Australia, the British Public Health Organization, and the Japanese Red Cross were compared. Team requirements, population distribution, type of accident, level of team activity and training, equipment required by the team after the accident, according to which, each country/organization should consider the above factors to design and establish the structure of CBRN EDMRT to take. A study should be conducted to design a comprehensive and evidence-based structure.  © The Author(s), 2023.

"This case note analyses an appeal decision (Khoin v Jenkins in Re: Observatory Civic Association v Trustees for the Time Being of the Liesbeek Leisure Properties Trust [2023] 1 All SA 110 (WCC)) handed down in 2022 by the Western Cape High Court, its purpose being to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the decision and to comment on possible future developments. The text of the judgment is interpreted in the light of judicial precedent, literature and domestic (South African) and international law. One of the key findings is that ""intangible heritage"" is an integral part of both domestic and international law, and the Khoin-case gives judicial recognition to the concept as a part of South African heritage law. One of the main criticisms levelled against the judgment is that it does not adhere to judicial precedent in failing to find that the right to consultation of First Nations Peoples before administrative action is taken that allegedly violates their constitutional rights to intangible heritage is sufficient to satisfy the test for the existence of a prima facie right for the purposes of obtaining an interim interdict. © 2023, North-West Unversity.

"This chapter provides a self-reflexive evaluation of the Sermon photographs from Waste Land (2005-2010), that was produced by the author for her practice-based PhD. T.S. Eliot's poem ""The Waste Land"" (1922) was used to examine her adaptation methodologies and self-representational strategies. Waterman visually translates her own experience of parental divorce through a close analysis of the text and literary criticism (Brooker and Bentley, Ellman, Miller, Parsons), acknowledging her biographical connections to Eliot's marriage to Vivienne Haigh Wood, to produce cathartic re-enactments, informed by phototherapy (Martin, Spence), memory and trauma studies (Barthes, Freud, Kaplan), feminine metaphors (Gilbert and Gubar, Horner and Zlosnik), and photographic self-portraiture (Chadwick, Lingwood). By interweaving these cross-disciplinary strands and reflecting on the actual process of making each photograph through a unique auto-criticism, Waterman demonstrates how her autobiographical literary interpretations offer a means of restaging memory through the creation of photographic narratives. © 2023 by IGI Global.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to determine the satisfaction of the guests who stay at hotels offering technology-supported products and services related to the services and products they receive by using the opinion mining technique. Design/methodology/approach: In this research, 12,396 customer reviews on booking.com related to ten hotels belonging to a hotel chain using technology-supported products were evaluated with aspect-based sentiment analysis techniques. Findings: As a result of this study, it has been determined that using technology in hotel businesses creates a positive impression on customer satisfaction. It has been determined that the enrichment of standard hotel business products such as beds and room lighting with technology, in a way that will not be very costly, affects the guests. In addition, it is interesting that technological features such as robots and room service robots, which are called “High & Technology” in this study, are evaluated by customers in the service process. Practical implications: The hotel managements have the opportunity to evaluate the services we offer by analyzing their online comments and to see their own image from the eyes of the guests. Hotel businesses must learn about customer expectations for technologies with high investment costs. This study, which analyzes online customer reviews, enables tourism businesses that offer technology-supported products and services and invest in technology in service delivery, to understand how customers evaluate the service. Originality/value: In this study, customer reviews of a hotel group operating in many countries belonging to a hotel group that enriches its standard products with technology and provides service with the concept of a “smart hotel” were examined. This study contributes to the understanding of customers' experience of using technological products in hotel businesses. This study contributes to the literature on customers' satisfaction with technological hotel products and services and the decision of hotels to invest in technology. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Objectives: To summarize reports describing implementation and evaluation of Web-based psychosocial interventions for disaster-related distress with suggestions for future intervention and research, and to determine whether a systematic literature review on the topic is warranted. Methods: Systematic searches of Embase, PsycINFO, and MEDLINE were conducted. Duplicate entries were removed. Two rounds of inclusion/exclusion were conducted (abstract and full-text review). Relevant data were systematically charted by 2 reviewers. Results: The initial search identified 112 reports. Six reports, describing and evaluating 5 interventions, were included in a data analysis. Four of the 5 interventions were asynchronous and self-guided modular programs, with interactive components. The fifth was a short-term, online supportive group intervention. Studies utilized a variety of evaluation methods, and only 1 of 14 outcome measures used across the studies was utilized in more than 1 project. Conclusions: Several Web-based psychosocial interventions have been developed to target disaster-related distress, but few programs have been formally evaluated. A systematic review of the topic would not be recommended at this time due to heterogeneity in reported studies. Further research on factors impacting participation, generalizability, and methods of program delivery with consistent outcome measures is needed.  © The Author(s), 2023.

"Summarizing a document has become a necessity as, because so much information is produced every day. Document summary makes it simpler to understand the text document than it would be to read through a collection of documents. A foundation for creating an condensed version of one or more text documents is provided by text summary. It is a crucial method for finding pertinent information on the Internet or in sizable text libraries. Additionally, it is essential to extract data in a way that the user would find the information interesting. Extractive summarization and abstract summarization are the two basic approaches used for text summarizing. In order to create the summary, the extractive summarization method chooses the sentences from a Word document and arranges them according to their weight. Abstractive summarizing is a technique that takes the key ideas from a document's content and expresses them abstractly in plain English. Numerous summary methods have been created on the foundation of these two approaches. There are numerous techniques that are language-specific exclusively. In this paper, we used extractive summarization methods and got good results. © 2023, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved."
"The present chapter discusses the ascending number of Internally Displaced Persons in the African Union. The emergence of this category links with the rising concerns for climate refugees. Environmental Internally Displaced People have become one of the most challenging issues of the modern world. The current chapter critically evaluates the Kampala convention for Internally Displaced People (IDPs, henceforth) due to climatic change. It is examined from the point of property relations (in the form of land or housing or relocation) based on the right to return for IDPs. The method imparts a qualitative engagement with the text concerned. It falls in the terrain of discourse analysis where we trace how the sense of return or restitution or repatriation can be raised in the Kampala Convention as well as other relevant documents. The chapter provides critical insight into the claim for Rights than Guidelines for Internally Displaced Persons. It maps the basic rights under the Kampala Convention, the 1998 Guiding Principles, Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC), and the Pinheiro Principles. The conventions addressing their concerns prescribe principles that are not legally binding among the States to follow. It becomes important to politically assert a Right based measure than posing an economic argument for a particular social group. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

"The increasing number of internet user influence the rise of internet data. One of the increasing internet data takes the form of online forum postings. These forum postings could be accessed from numerous postings portals on the internet. Some portals show only the posting title to let the readers decide whether they want to read it or not by reading the title only. In this study, the author study whether an online postings headline or title could influence reading interest in the community by using the Naïve Bayes and decision tree methods as a comparison. Based on analysis using Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree algorithm, the result shows that title of postings can influence as high as 73% popularity of the postings.  © 2023 Author(s)."
"The study focused on the texts of high-quality accreditation resolutions of Higher Education Institutions in Colombia. The methodological approach led to a descriptive overview and allowed the construction of qualitative categories that enabled the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses. The results show the gap between the urban and rural contexts; a tendency of official institutions to receive more years of accreditation than private ones and the non-incidence of the academic nature in the number of years of accreditation granted. Improving professors’ working conditions and attending rural areas are some of the priorities that national policies must undertake. © GKA Ediciones, authors."
"Objective: To evaluate the influence of non-invasive treatment associated with the use of infiltrating resin for managing caries lesions in primary teeth. Material and Methods: A systematic review was performed by selecting articles from 6 online databases, using a search algorithm and eligibility criteria for data extraction and data synthesis for the papers included. Clinical trials involving primary teeth with incipient caries lesions (1/2 of the enamel or 1/3 of the outer dentin) were included, presenting full text and answering the study's guiding question. This study used the RoB 2 tool for the risk of bias assessment and GRADE for certainty of evidence. Random effects meta-analyses were implemented, and lesion progression treatment effects were estimated through relative risk (RR) and associated 95% confidence intervals. Results: A total of 440 studies were found. After analyzing the inclusion criteria and removal of duplicates, eight studies were analyzed for quality evidence. Five of the eight studies included in this review contributed to the meta-analysis, all with some reflections regarding the risk of bias. Overall, the results of the meta-analysis showed that non-invasive treatment, when associated with the use of infiltrating resins, significantly reduced the risk of caries progression in relation to the treatment without this addition for follow-up periods ranging from 12 months to 2 years (RR 0.51 [0.40-0.65]). Conclusion: There is moderate certainty of evidence that the use of infiltrating resins associated with non-invasive treatments decreases the risk of caries progression in primary teeth with incipient caries lesions (1/2 of the enamel or 1/3 of the dentin outer) when combined with non-invasive control methods alone. © 2023, Association of Support to Oral Health Research (APESB).

"Purpose: The objective of this study was to look closely at how domestic violence is represented in Pakistani drama serials to see if portrayals are reinforcing stereotypical and/or patriarchal values, or breaking the rigid norms. Design/methodology/approach: With the help of dispositive analysis within the critical discourse approach, the prominent and non-dominant discourses about domestic violence were identified and discussed. Episodes from two popular drama serials, Kaisa Yeh Naseeban and Khaas, released in 2019, were watched with special focus on texts on domestic violence alongside objects and actions. Findings: Analysis showed that both drama serials gave importance to socio-systemic and liberal humanist instrumentalism discourses, which describe domestic violence as a result of social structures and that abuse is used to assert control, respectively. However, some instances were noted where patriarchal values were encouraged. Originality/value: As media has become a powerful tool of influence and awareness in the recent times, it is imperative that the content watched on it by millions of people be studied and analyzed. It is claimed that Pakistani drama serials with wide following and that are made on social issues around women aim to raise awareness and empower them. Domestic violence is a prevalent issue in Pakistan, and no research till date has examined representation of domestic violence on Pakistani popular media, which may influence response to domestic violence, which this paper aims to do. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Objectives Individuals with fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) are over-represented within the justice system and have significant employment challenges. The primary aim of this scoping review was to ascertain available employment resources for FASD individuals particularly those involved in the justice system. Secondary aims were to determine available evidence-based interventions for the justice workforce and employment providers. Methods Eligibility criteria: That the resource was (a) published between 1990 and 2021, (b) in English, (c) available electronically in full text, (d) focused on strategies for improving employment outcomes of individuals with FASD and (f) developed for those aged over 15. Sources of evidence: Electronic searches of the following databases were conducted: EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. Grey literature was collected via the databases ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global, OpenGrey, GreyNet International and Grey Matters. Charting methods: Using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews reporting guidelines, a five-stage methodological framework was employed. A quality appraisal of identified resources was conducted. Data were summarised qualitatively using a content analysis method that allowed for analysis of specific terms/themes/concepts/resource elements that resources covered, as well as a quantitative analysis of their frequency. Results An initial search identified 850 articles, 512 of which were obtained through online database searches, 321 through Google Scholar searches and 17 through google searches. Sixteen resources were identified as meeting inclusion criteria, including four peer-reviewed papers and 12 grey literature resources. Six of the resources extracted were deemed 'good' or 'strong' quality, with the remainder - all grey literature resources - being 'adequate' or 'limited'. None of the resources identified were empirically evaluated or could be implemented synergistically. Content analysis revealed common themes addressing FASD-related employment challenges and required supports. Conclusions This review highlights the need for developing evidence-based employment-related resources for justice-involved people with FASD. Most of the 16 identified resources had a psychoeducational and advocacy component and described typical employment challenges with specific supports and accommodations to maximise workforce participation. However, none had been empirically evaluated, underscoring the importance of future research in this area to better inform more responsive and evidence-based employment-related programmes.

"Objective: Theoretical models of addictive behavior suggest that subjective effects serve as a mechanism through which substance use disorders develop. However, little is known about the subjective effects of simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use, particularly whether simultaneous use (a) heightens specific subjective effects or (b) is related to unique subjective effects relative to single-substance effects. The present study used formative, qualitative data analysis to examine patterns of responses within open-answer text response data on subjective effects of simultaneous use. Method: College students who simultaneously use alcohol and cannabis (N = 443; 68.2% female) were asked to describe how alcohol effects differ on simultaneous alcohol and cannabis use versus alcohol-only use days. Results: Conventional content analysis revealed nine concepts related to simultaneous (vs. alcohol-only) use subjective effects including as follows: (a) increased/decreased impairment, (b) low arousal/relaxation, (c) balancing/replacement effects, (d) “cross-faded” effects, (e) little-to no differences, (f) altered sensation and perception, (g) increased negative affective states, (h) increased appetite, and (i) increased/decreased negative consequences. Increased impairment (N = 191) and increased relaxation (N = 110) were the most often endorsed subjective effects, followed by decreased impairment (N = 55), balancing/replacement effects (N = 50) and cross-faded/enhancement effects (N = 44). Conclusions: Subjective effects from simultaneous use largely map onto domains of single-substance alcohol and cannabis effects (e.g., relaxation, sociability, cognitive/behavioral impairment), but also include distinct domains related to simultaneous use (e.g., balancing/replacement effects, altered sensation and perception). Future quantitative research is needed to validate measures of subjective effects from simultaneous use and their relations with use behavior. © 2023 American Psychological Association"
"Objective Ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) was developed to promote CVH as a key component of primordial prevention. Mobile short message service (SMS) is useful for improving health behaviours. We aim to test the effectiveness of SMS intervention in women to improve CVH. Methods In a single-blinded, randomised, controlled study, 620 women, aged 35-70 years, without cardiovascular disease, were enrolled in SMS intervention versus no SMS. CVH metrics by self-report, and biochemical laboratory, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were collected during home visits at baseline and 9 months. Women were categorised as having poor (0-2), intermediate (3-4) or ideal (5-7) CVH according to the number of ideal CVH metrics. Participants were randomised 1:1 to SMS intervention versus control. SMS was sent every 5-6 days for 9 months. The primary outcome was the difference in the proportion of women with ideal CVH between SMS and control groups at 9 months. Rates of intermediate CVH, poor CVH and each of the seven ideal CV health metrics at 9 months were key secondary endpoints. Results At 9 months, there was no significant difference between groups for the primary outcome (16.3% at baseline and 13.3% at 9 months, and 10.1% and 11.1%, in SMS and control groups, respectively, adjusted RR 1.0; 95% CI 0.6 to 1.6). Similarly, there were no significant differences between groups for the key secondary endpoints. SMS had an acceptance rate of 94.9%. Conclusions Behavioural SMS intervention did not improve rates of ideal CVH in women, despite being feasible and well received. Trial registration number 6377.  © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

"This update covers publications from the second half of 2021 to the middle of 2022. Advances in the application of atomic spectrometry techniques to clinical and biological materials, foods and beverages are reviewed in the text, highlighting their key features. Technical details of sample collection and preparation, as well as progresses with analytical techniques are considered and three tables complement the text, summarising details of a larger spectrum of publications. During this period, the trend toward the application of multi-element techniques, such as EDXRFS, ICP-MS and LIBS continued, in particular for food authenticity studies. Triple quadrupole ICP-MS is becoming increasing popular, as it is less affected by interferences, as well as LIBS and XRF, that require minimal sample preparation. However, AAS is still considered a valid alternative for single or a limited number of elements: as in previous years, numerous pre-concentration techniques were presented, some of which explored “greener” reagents. The interest in NPs continued, both as a potential exposure risk and for their application as tags of biological materials, and led to a wider application of spICP-MS. Chromium speciation in food received more attention than usual during this period, providing evidence that the carcinogenic species CrVI was not present. A number of studies covered the application of atomic spectrometry techniques for the indirect determination of biological macromolecules, including an interesting application of LIBS for the rapid detection of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry."
"Objective: The objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of perioperative prophylactic tranexamic acid for reducing blood loss in orthognathic surgery in healthy patients. Introduction: Orthognathic surgery can cause significant hemorrhage, which requires postoperative blood transfusions. The most widely studied pharmaceutical adjunct for reducing blood loss is tranexamic acid, a synthetic amino acid that reversibly inhibits plasminogen activation. It is widely used and validated in other surgical procedures to limit blood loss; however, it is not a gold standard in orthognathic surgery. Inclusion criteria: We will include clinical trials comparing tranexamic acid to appropriate controls. The primary outcomes are intraoperative blood loss, change in hematocrit/hemoglobin level, and need for blood transfusion. Secondary outcomes include operating time, length of hospital stay, and adverse reactions. Studies of patients with pre-existing coagulopathies and those undergoing only minor orthognathic surgery (eg, genioplasty) will be excluded. Methods: We will search 3 electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) from database inception. Titles, abstracts, and full-text papers will be assessed against the inclusion criteria by 2 independent reviewers. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 tool. Data will be extracted by 2 independent reviewers. Meta-analysis will be conducted for all outcomes where appropriate, with weighted mean differences used for intraoperative blood loss, changes in hematocrit/hemoglobin levels, operation time, and length of stay; and risk ratio for transfusion rates and adverse outcomes. Certainty of the evidence will be presented using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.

"Background and ObjectivesTo describe neurologist practice patterns, challenges, and decision support needs pertaining to withdrawal of antiseizure medications (ASMs) in patients with well-controlled epilepsy.MethodsWe sent an electronic survey to (1) US and (2) European physician members of the American Academy of Neurology and (3) members of EpiCARE, a European Reference Network for rare and complex epilepsies. Analyses included frequencies and percentages, and we showed distributions through histograms and violin plots.ResultsWe sent the survey to 4,923 individuals; 463 consented, 411 passed eligibility questions, and 287 responded to at least 1 of these questions. Most respondents indicated that they might ever consider ASM withdrawal, with respondents treating mostly children being more likely ever to consider withdrawal (e.g., medical monotherapy: children 96% vs adults 81%; p < 0.05). The most important factors when making decisions included seizure probability (83%), consequences of seizures (73%), and driving (74%). The top challenges when making decisions included unclear seizure probability (81%), inadequate guidelines (50%), and difficulty communicating probabilities (45%). Respondents would consider withdrawal after a median of 2-year seizure freedom, but also responded that they would begin withdrawal on average only when the postwithdrawal seizure relapse risk in the coming 2 years was less than 15%-30%. Wide variation existed in the use of words or numbers in respondents' counsel methods, for example, percentages vs frequencies or probability of seizure freedom vs seizure. The most highly rated point-of-care methods to inform providers of calculated risk were Kaplan-Meier curves and showing percentages only, rather than pictographs or text recommendations alone.DiscussionMost surveyed neurologists would consider withdrawing ASMs in seizure-free individuals. Seizure probability was the largest factor driving decisions, yet estimating seizure probabilities was the greatest challenge. Respondents on average indicated that they may withdraw ASM after a minimum seizure-free duration of 2 years, yet also on average were willing to withdraw when seizure risk decreased below 15%-30%, which is lower than most patients' postwithdrawal risk at 2-year seizure freedom and lower than the equivalent even of a first seizure of life. These findings will inform future efforts at developing decision support tools aimed at optimizing ASM withdrawal decisions.  © American Academy of Neurology."
"Background: Recruitment and retention of farm veterinarians have been the focus of recent research. Previous work suggests that a feeling of ‘fit’ is important for students to consider a farm career. The aim of this study was to identify whether students feel that they ‘fit’ in farm practice and reasons for their answer. Methods: An online survey was distributed to students at all British and Irish veterinary schools. A mixed methods approach was considered, with thematic analysis on free text answers and regression analysis on demographic variables. Results: Thematic analysis identified six themes: career opportunities, nature of farm veterinary work, relationships and interactions, individual experiences, expectations and perceptions, and no perceived barriers. Females, marginalised ethnic groups and those from an urban/suburban background were all identified as having significantly (p < 0.05) less agreement with the statement ‘I feel able to pursue a career in farm practice’. Limitations: Survey limitations include those with a clear bias being likely to respond. However, alignment of the qualitative and quantitative results increased confidence in the findings of this mixed methods approach. Conclusion: This study confirms that biases that exist within wider society do have an influence on veterinary undergraduates' intentions to pursue a farm animal career. This is vital to consider both at a university level and when considering students' experiences on placements. Urgent action is required to improve inclusivity in the farm animal veterinary sector. © 2022 The Authors.

"Municipal wastewater collection and treatment systems are critical infrastructures, and they are also identified as major sources of anthropogenic CH4 emissions that contribute to climate change. The actual CH4 emissions at the plant- or regional level vary greatly due to site-specific conditions as well as high seasonal and diurnal variations. Here, we conducted the first quantitative analysis of CH4 emissions from different types of sewers and water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs). We examined variations in CH4 emissions associated with methods applied in different monitoring campaigns, and identified main CH4 sources and sinks to facilitate carbon emission reduction efforts in the wastewater sector. We found plant-wide CH4 emissions vary by orders of magnitude, from 0.01 to 110 g CH4/m3 with high emissions associated with plants equipped with anaerobic digestion or stabilization ponds. Rising mains show higher dissolved CH4 concentrations than gravity sewers when transporting similar raw sewage under similar environmental conditions, but the latter dominates most collection systems around the world. Using the updated data sets, we estimated annual CH4 emission from the U.S. centralized, municipal wastewater treatment to be approximately 10.9 ± 7.0 MMT CO2-eq/year, which is about twice as the IPCC (2019) Tier 2 estimates (4.3-6.1 MMT CO2-eq/year). Given CH4 emission control will play a crucial role in achieving net zero carbon goals by the midcentury, more studies are needed to profile and mitigate CH4 emissions from the wastewater sector. © 2023 American Chemical Society."
"In recent years, voice-interaction-based control systems have attracted considerable attention for industrial control systems implementing Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies. The development of automated semantic understanding relates to the industrial Internet equipment used to realize remote voice control as well as to its intelligent management and control. In these emerging voice-interaction-enabled industrial central control systems, sorting technologies are considered critical. For complex user questions, the level of satisfaction regarding the answers given by such systems tends to be low. Driven by these challenges and opportunities, the optimization of conventional retrieval-based question answering through deep learning methods has become popular. In this study, we propose three deep semantic sorting models based on deep learning, including a multilayer convolutional matching sorting model for single documents and two interactive pairwise bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) sorting models for document pairs. Two main network architectures are proposed to model document pairs, named Pairwise-Twin-BERT and Pairwise-Triple-BERT. Experimental results indicate that proposed models performed better than state-of-the-art methods based on text matching in a candidate document sorting task.  © 2014 IEEE."
"This paper mainly studies the global exponential stability in Lagrange sense (GESLS) of quaternion memristive neural networks (QMNNs) with leakage delays, unbounded distributed delays and time-varying discrete time delays. In the process of research, instead of traditional decomposition into real-valued memristive neural networks (RMNNs) or complex-valued memristive neural networks (CMNNs), we consider the QMNN as a whole, and then give a sufficient condition related to time delays to ensure that the considered QMNN is GESLS. An example is provided to illustrate validity of theoretical results obtained in the end. The method proposed in the present text has two merits: (1) According to the definition of GESLS directly, no Lyapunov–Krasovskii functional (LKF) is required, which avoids massive calculations and solutions of high-dimensional matrix inequalities; (2) It is available not only to QMNNs, but also to RMNNs and CMNNs. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"BACKGROUND: Prior research suggests an association between clinical outcomes in heart failure (HF) and social determinants of health (SDoH). Because providers should identify and address SDoH in care delivery, we evaluated how SDoH have been defined, measured, and evaluated in studies that examine HF outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines, databases were searched for observational or interventional studies published between 2009 and 2021 that assessed the influence of SDoH on outcomes. Selected articles were assessed for quality using a validated rating scheme. We identified 1373 unique articles for screening; 104 were selected for full-text review, and 59 met the inclusion criteria, including retrospective and prospective cohort, cross-sectional, and intervention studies. The majority examined readmissions and hospitalizations (k=33), mortality or survival (k=29), and success of medical devices and transplantation (k=8). SDoH examined most commonly included race, ethnicity, age, sex, socioeconomic status, and education or health literacy. Studies used a range of 1 to 9 SDoH as primary independent variables and 0 to 7 SDoH as controls. Multiple data sources were employed and frequently were electronic medical records linked with national surveys and disease registries. The effects of SDoH on HF outcomes were inconsistent because of the heterogeneity of data sources and SDoH constructs. CONCLUSIONS: Our systematic review reveals shortcomings in measurement and deployment of SDoH variables in HF care. Validated measures need to be prospectively and intentionally collected to facilitate appropriate analysis, reporting, and replication of data across studies and inform the design of appropriate, evidence-based interventions that can ameliorate significant HF morbidity and societal costs. © 2023 The Authors.

"Purpose: Privacy considerations have become a topic with increasing interest from academics, industry leaders and regulators. In response to consumers’ privacy concerns, Google announced in 2020 that Chrome would stop supporting third-party cookies in the near future. At the same time, advertising technology companies are developing alternative solutions for online targeting and consumer privacy controls. This paper aims to explore privacy considerations related to online tracking and targeting methods used for programmatic advertising (i.e. third-party cookies, Privacy Sandbox, Unified ID 2.0) for a variety of stakeholders: consumers, AdTech platforms, advertisers and publishers. Design/methodology/approach: This study analyzes the topic of internet user privacy concerns, through a multi-pronged approach: industry conversations to collect information, a comprehensive review of trade publications and extensive empirical analysis. This study uses two methods to collect data on consumer preferences for privacy controls: a survey of a representative sample of US consumers and field data from conversations on web-forums created by tech professionals. Findings: The results suggest that there are four main segments in the US internet user population. The first segment, consisting of 26% of internet users, is driven by a strong preference for relevant ads and includes consumers who accept the premises of both Privacy Sandbox and Unified ID (UID) 2.0. The second segment (26%) includes consumers who are ambivalent about both sets of premises. The third segment (34%) is driven by a need for relevant ads and a strong desire to prevent advertisers from aggressively collecting data, with consumers who accept the premises of Privacy Sandbox but reject the premises of UID 2.0. The fourth segment (15% of consumers) rejected both sets of premises about privacy control. Text analysis results suggest that the conversation around UID 2.0 is still nascent. Google Sandbox associations seem nominally positive, with sarcasm being an important factor in the sentiment analysis results. Originality/value: The value of this paper lies in its multi-method examination of online privacy concerns in light of the recent regulatory legislation (i.e. General Data Protection Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act) and changes for third-party cookies in browsers such as Firefox, Safari and Chrome. Two alternatives proposed to replace third-party cookies (Privacy Sandbox and Unified ID 2.0) are in the proposal and prototype stage. The elimination of third-party cookies will affect stakeholders, including different types of players in the AdTech industry and internet users. This paper analyzes how two alternative proposals for privacy control align with the interests of several stakeholders. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Predictive legal analytics is a technology used to predict the chances of successful and unsuccessful outcomes in a particular case. Predictive legal analytics is performed through automated document classification for facilitating legal experts in their classification of court documents to retrieve and understand the details of specific legal factors from legal judgments for accurate document analysis. However, extracting these factors from legal texts document is a time-consuming process. In order to facilitate the task of classifying documents, a robust method namely Distributed Stochastic Keyword Extraction based Ensemble Theil-Sen Regressive Deep Belief Reweight Boost Classification (DSKE-TRDBRBC) is proposed. The DSKE-TRDBRBC technique consists of two major processes namely Keyword Extraction and Classification. At first, the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding technique is applied to DSKETRDBRBC for keyword extraction. This in turn minimizes the time consumption for document classification. After that, the Ensemble Theil-Sen Regressive Deep Belief Reweight Boosting technique is applied for document classification. The Ensemble boosting algorithm initially constructs’ set of Theil-Sen Regressive Deep Belief neural networks to classify the input legal documents. Then the results of the Deep Belief neural network are combined to built a strong classifier by reducing the error. This aids in improving the classification accuracy. The proposed method is experimentally evaluated with various metrics such as F-measure, recall, accuracy, precision,, and computational time. The experimental results quantitatively confirm that the proposed DSKE-TRDBRBC technique achieves better accuracy with lowest computation time as compared to the conventional approaches. © 2023 International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication.

"With the continuous advancement of urban renewal, innovative and creative spaces in the urban village have attracted much attention as a new model of space restoration. In the process of material space transformation, the emotional identity and place identity of innovative and creative spaces in urban villages are reconstructed. However, communities and residents in the urban village remain often been neglected in previous studies, most of which focused on the material and economic perspectives. In other words, the emotional mechanisms and spatial influences of relevant subjects in innovative and creative spaces have not received sufficient attention. By focusing on the innovative and creative spaces of Huangpu village in Guangzhou as an example, this study employed in-depth interviews, network text analysis, and other methods to explore the impact of innovative and creative spaces on residents' sense of place and their role in creating a local emotional identity within the context of urban renewal from the perspective of emotional geography. The innovative and creative spaces of the urban villages exerted a different impact on the local emotion and space identity of multiple subjects through the reshaping of the material environment, culture, and social relations. The improvement of the material environment of the innovative and creative spaces in the urban villages enhanced the emotional identity and local attachment of residents. The cultural values of modern industrial forms were not able to shape the local and cultural identities of residents but increased the level of makers. The local identity of the tenant group was based on creativity and cultural atmosphere. The innovative and creative spaces of the urban villages formed a social network relationship with industry as the link by strengthening the interaction and connection between the subjects, establishing a common emotional attachment and local identity, and transforming the original traditional living space into a multi-dimensional space with consumption, production, and leisure attributes. The emotion and atmosphere of the innovative and creative spaces were displayed during the interaction between makers and residents and during the production of creative products and made different subjects participate in the process of space-remodeling. Not only did this process strengthen the perception and recognition of innovative and creative elements and rural areas, but it also established the recognition of a common local value. Given the current emphasis on the reuse of stock space resources, such as industrial heritage and historical buildings, it is particularly important to focus on the emotional connection between humans and the environment. From the perspective of emotional geography, it is of great significance that the emotional effect and meaning of constructing innovative and creative spaces on rural development are elucidated. This study provides not only a theoretical perspective for a deeper understanding of the relationship between the innovative and creative spaces and the locality of urban villages but also insights into promoting culturally oriented urban renewal. © 2023 The Author(s)."

"The aim of the research is to identify semantic models of humorous utterances that express the stereotypical ideas of the lawyers' professional community about the content of the categories of its participants in informal settings. The research methodology integrates two approaches: a critical analysis of discourse and a semantic approach to humour based on scripts by Salvatore Attardo and Victor Raskin. We applied the following analysis model: (1) discursive analysis of texts in accordance with the procedure presented in the papers of foreign and Russian scholars; (2) analysis of humour in accordance with the six-level model of analysis proposed by Attardo; (3) as the research includes transformed statements consisting of a complex of elements and their interrelationships to varying degrees, the methodology is supplemented by the theory of conceptual integration developed by Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner. The research methods are: discourse analysis, including standard techniques of communicative-pragmatic and semantic analysis; content analysis, the semantic categories of which are the parameters of the sociocommunicative level of the model, and the units are their typical lexical markers. The data include Internet memes constituting the content of professional legal groups on the social networks Instagram and Facebook. The data include 260 units. The analysis revealed a quantitative predominance in Internet memes expressing the subjects of legal discourse of models based on contrast and referential humour. The semantic dominants actualised in such models coincide with the stereotypical attitudes currently existing in society in relation to the legal community and its professional participants. The uneven distribution of models in accordance with the categories of participants indicates the predominance of reflection in relation to several professional participants - an advocate and a lawyer: intensity of professional activity and high fatigue, prestige of professional status and high social responsibility of professional participants, competence and professionalism (unprofessionalism), complexity and incomprehensibility of the language, high profit. In relation to non-professional participants (client/accused/defendant/respondent/witness), the stereotypes about their stupidity, greed, arrogance, venality are replicated. Referential models are distinguished by the diversity of the subjects represented and the uniformity of the meanings expressed: the subject's originality of thinking, cunningness and resourcefulness. Semantic models based on conceptual integration were identified only in relation to professional participants - a lawyer. They actualise such values as professionalism, reliability, competence; stress associated with responsibility at work, danger and charm of the profession, special status; superiority; friendliness; help and superpowers of the professional. © 2023 Tomsk State University.

"[Objective] This paper decomposes the named entity recognition models based on neural network for Chinese medical texts. We investigate the impacts of single neural network module and the collaboration of multiple modules on the entity recognition performance. [Methods] First, we chosed the benchmark datasets from CCKS2017, CCKS2019, and IMCS-NER for named entity recognition tasks. Then, we conducted extensive experiments to compare the performance of different single modules of the aforementioned layers. Third, we built and compared entity recognition models based on ensemble, parallel, and serial neural models. [Results] Using hfl/chinese-macbert-base, hfl/chinese-roberta-wwm-ext, hfl/chinese-bert-wwm-ext in the symbolic representation layer significantly improved the performance of entity recognition models, the average F1-scores reached 0.8816, 0.8816 and 0.8812 respectively. Stacking neural models at the context encoding layer improved the performance of the neural network. Moreover, ensembled neural networks could achieve the best performance, the F1-scores reached 0.9330, 0.8211 and 0.9181 respectively. [Limitations] More research is needed to examine our findings with datasets in other languages. [Conclusions] The characteristics of single neural modules and their collaboration could significantly affect the performance of the named entity recognition of Chinese medical texts. © 2023, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

"Model organisms are instrumental substitutes for human studies to expedite basic, translational, and clinical research. Despite their indispensable role in mechanistic investigation and drug development, molecular congruence of animal models to humans has long been questioned and debated. Little effort has been made for an objective quantification and mechanistic exploration of a model organism's resemblance to humans in terms of molecular response under disease or drug treatment. We hereby propose a framework, namely Congruence Analysis for Model Organisms (CAMO), for transcriptomic response analysis by developing threshold-free differential expression analysis, quantitative concordance/discordance scores incorporating data variabilities, pathway-centric downstream investigation, knowledge retrieval by text mining, and topological gene module detection for hypothesis generation. Instead of a genome-wide vague and dichotomous answer of ""poorly"" or ""greatly"" mimicking humans, CAMO assists researchers to numerically quantify congruence, to dissect true cross-species differences from unwanted biological or cohort variabilities, and to visually identify molecular mechanisms and pathway subnetworks that are best or least mimicked by model organisms, which altogether provides foundations for hypothesis generation and subsequent translational decisions. © 2023 National Academy of Sciences.

"Objectives: To analyze the global research trends of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) from 2000 to 2022 and explore new frontiers in this field. Methods: We reviewed the literature in the Web of Science Core Collection database from January 2000 to August 2022 using the retrieval strategy of medical subject headings combined with text words. We focused on articles and reviews that were published in English. Relevant data of the target publications, such as title, authors, organizations, abstract, keywords, published date, journal, and number of citations, were collected. The R software with the “bibliometrix” and VOSviewer software was used to process and visualize the information. Results: Among a total of 20,581 records related to HCM, 13,427 from 103 countries and regions, 8,676 affiliations, and 46,645 researchers were included. Most of the publications in this field were from the United States, followed by Japan, the United Kingdom, and China. We also report the top 10 institutions and most influential researchers, cited articles, and highest-frequency keywords (echocardiography, heart failure, sudden cardiac death, genetics, atrial fibrillation, magnetic resonance imaging/cardiac magnetic resonance, prognosis, mutation, arrhythmia, late gadolinium enhancement). In addition, keywords trend analysis indicated that the novel medicine Mavacamten, genetic diagnosis, and cardiac magnetic resonance have attracted the most attention for the treatment and diagnosis of HCM over the past five years. Conclusion: The present study reports on the global research trends of HCM over the past two decades using bibliometric analysis. It may enlighten new frontiers in the diagnosis, treatment, and risk prevention of HCM. Copyright © 2023 Zheng, He, Li and Jia."
"Drawing on critical theories of labor and commodification, this qualitative embedded case study explores how students experience alienation and intimacy in the work of writing for an English language arts class. Analysis of fieldnotes from 30 observations, student writing products, and reflective interviews with focal students and the teacher illuminated the meaningful assemblages where conditions of intimacy permeated instruction. Two practices supported intimacy in working conditions: knowledge about writing built through a collective process of noticing, and open-ended work time characterized by “managed nonmanagement” (Tsing, 2015, p. 176), or calculated flexibility in rules and expectations. Findings illustrate how a literacy practice might contribute to students’ experience of alienation or intimacy (or both) while writing, depending on conditions of industrialization and commodification. Even as the teacher strove to deindustrialize work, commodification through grades and standardized assessments heightened alienation in the writing environment. The study provides an example of an educational context governed by an industrial system of assessment where local actors (the teacher and students) disrupted alienation by working in smaller scales and more closely with texts.

"During the operation and maintenance management of power equipment in the electric power grid, a massive amount of unstructured text information is available. The construction of a power equipment text semantic analysis model for mining the unstructured text information to improve the efficiency and accuracy of equipment defect and fault diagnosis, and assist power grid operation and maintenance decision-making is a practical and challenging task. This paper proposes a semantic analysis model of power equipment text based on a super large-scale pre-training method (Power BERT). The proposed solution adopts the multi-head attention mechanism and multi-layer embedded semantic expression structure. The total number of model parameters exceeds 110 million to implement the understanding and analysis of the information contained in the power text. The data sources cover the power professional corpus consisting of power standards and management regulations (more than1.862 billion characters in total). It adopts various mask mechanisms, e.g., character mask, entity mask and fragment mask and dynamic loading strategies to carry out the model pre-training, task scenario training and optimization for the text entity recognition, information extraction and defect diagnosis. The proposed solution is assessed through comparison with the conventional deep learning algorithms, and the numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solution can improve the recall and accuracy of verification set and test set by 20%~30% based on a limited number of samples. ©2023 Chin.Soc.for Elec.Eng."
"We novelly applied established ecology methods to quantify and compare language diversity within a corpus of short written student texts. Constructed responses (CRs) are a common form of assessment but are difficult to evaluate using traditional methods of lexical diversity due to text length restrictions. Herein, we examined the utility of ecological diversity measures and ordination techniques to quantify differences in short texts by applying these methods in parallel to traditional text analysis methods to a corpus of previously studied college student CRs. The CRs were collected at two time points (Timing), from three types of higher-ed institutions (Type), and across three levels of student understanding (Thinking). Using previous work, we were able to predict that we would observe the most difference based on Thinking, then Timing and did not expect differences based on Type allowing us to test the utility of these methods for categorical examination of the corpus. We found that the ecological diversity metrics that compare CRs to each other (Whittaker’s beta, species turnover, and Bray–Curtis Dissimilarity) were informative and correlated well with our predicted differences among categories and other text analysis methods. Other ecological measures, including Shannon’s and Simpson’s diversity, measure the diversity of language within a single CR. Additionally, ordination provided meaningful visual representations of the corpus by reducing complex word frequency matrices to two-dimensional graphs. Using the ordination graphs, we were able to observe patterns in the CR corpus that further supported our predictions for the data set. This work establishes novel approaches to measuring language diversity within short texts that can be used to examine differences in student language and possible associations with categorical data.

"Rabies is a deadly viral infection for which there is still no definitive cure. Many researchers are making publication on this subject. The current study used bibliometric techniques to examine the rabies literature and highlighted current rabies research trends as well as prospective future hotspots for rabies research. In this bibliometric study, all data were retrieved from the Web of Science Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) database on January 1, 2023, using the selected terms (""rabies virus"" [MeSH Terms] OR ""rabies virus"" [Text Word] OR ""rabies"" [MeSH Terms] OR ""rabies"" [Text Word]) in the title field of the search engine. The search was further narrowed by the document type (article), language (English), and year of publication (1992–2022). According to the used search strategy, we reached a total of 5973 articles. The average number of citations per document was 21.3. Over 300 articles per year were published in the years 2020, 2021, 2019, 2018, and 2017. The rabies literature was written by authors from 158 different countries. The main countries with the highest number of articles on rabies were the USA, China, and France. Germany, India, Brazil, England, Japan, and Canada Research collaboration and cooperation between institutions and researchers in developing countries need to be supported by developed countries. The analysis provides information on the overall situation of rabies research worldwide. The analysis also provides a better understanding of the trends in rabies development over the past 30 years, which can serve as a scientific benchmark for subsequent studies. © 2023."

"Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate service user (SU) and clinician acceptability of video care, including future preferences to inform mental health practice during COVID-19, and beyond. Design/methodology/approach: Structured questionnaires were co-developed with SUs and clinicians. The SU online experience questionnaire was built into video consultations (VCs) via the Attend Anywhere platform, completed between July 2020 and March 2021. A Trust-wide clinician experience survey was conducted between July and October 2020. Chi-squared test was performed for any differences in clinician VC rating by mental health difficulties, with the content analysis used for free-text data. Findings: Of 1,275 SUs completing the questionnaire following VC, most felt supported (93.4%), and their needs were met (90%). For future appointments, 51.8% of SUs preferred video, followed by face-to-face (33%), with COVID-related and practical reasons given. Of 249 clinicians, 161 (64.7%) had used VCs. Most felt the therapeutic relationship (76.4%) and privacy (78.7%) were maintained. Clinicians felt confident about clinical assessment and management using video. However, they were less confident in assessing psychotic symptoms and initiating psychotropic medications. There were no significant differences in clinician VC rating by mental health difficulties. For future, more SUs preferred using video, with a quarter providing practical reasons. Originality/value: The study provides a real-world example of video care implementation. In addition to highlighting clinician needs, support at the wider system/policy level, with a focus on addressing inequalities, can inform mental health care beyond COVID-19. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Background: Chronic health conditions in children and adolescents can have profound impacts on education, well-being and health. They are described as non-communicable illnesses that are prolonged in duration, do not resolve spontaneously, and rarely cured completely. Due to variations in the definition of chronic health conditions and how they are measured prevalence estimates vary considerably and have been reported to be as high as 44% in children and adolescents. Of young people with a chronic health condition, an estimated 5% are affected by severe conditions characterised by limitations to daily activities impacting their ability to attend school. School attendance is important for academic and social skill development as well as well-being. When children and adolescents are absent from school due to a chronic health condition, school engagement can be affected. Disengagement from school is associated with poorer academic achievement, social-emotional functioning and career choices. Education support services for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions aim to prevent disengagement from school, education and learning during periods where their illness caused them to miss school. However, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of educational support interventions at improving school engagement and educational/learning outcomes for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. Objectives: To describe the nature of educational support interventions for children and adolescents with a chronic health condition, and to examine the effectiveness of these interventions on school engagement and academic achievement. Search methods: We searched eight electronic databases which span the health/medical, social sciences and education disciplines between 18 and 25 January 2021: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid). CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (EBSCO), ERIC (Education Resources Information Center), Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts: ASSIA (ProQuest), and PubMed (from 2019). We also searched five grey literature trials registers and databases between 8 and 12 February 2021 to identify additional published and unpublished studies, theses and conference abstracts, as well as snowballing reference lists of included studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-and-after studies and interrupted time series studies that met the inclusion criteria were selected. Other inclusion criteria were: participants - must include children or adolescents (aged four to 18 years) with a chronic health condition, intervention - must include educational support, outcomes - must report the primary outcomes (i.e. school engagement or academic achievement) or secondary outcomes (i.e. quality of life, transition to school/school re-entry, mental health or adverse outcomes). Data collection and analysis: Two people independently screened titles and abstracts, and full-text articles, to identify included studies. Where disagreements arose between reviewers, the two reviewers discussed the discrepancy. If resolution was unable to be achieved, the issues were discussed with a senior reviewer to resolve the matter. We extracted study characteristic data and risk of bias data from the full texts of included studies using a data extraction form before entering the information into Review Manager 5.4.1. Two people independently extracted data, assessed risk of bias of individual studies and undertook GRADE assessments of the quality of the evidence. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the small number of studies for each outcome. Our synthesis, therefore, used vote-counting based on the direction of the effect/impact of the intervention. Main results: The database searches identified 14,202 titles and abstracts. Grey literature and reference list searches did not identify any additional studies that met the inclusion criteria. One hundred and twelve full-text studies were assessed for eligibility, of which four studies met the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review. All studies were randomised controlled studies with a combined total of 359 participants. All included studies were disease-specific; three studies focused on children with cancer, and one study focused on children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). There was evidence that education support improved school engagement with three of four studies favouring the intervention. Three studies measured academic achievement but only two studies provided effect estimates. Based on the vote-counting method, we found contradictory results from the studies: one study showed a positive direction of effect and the other study showed a negative direction of effect. One study measured transition back to school and found a positive impact of education support favouring the intervention (SMD 0.18, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.96, no P value reported). The result came from a single study with a small sample size (n = 30), and produced a confidence interval that indicated the possibility of a very small or no effect. The overall certainty of evidence for these three outcomes was judged to be 'very low'. Two of four studies measured mental health (measured as self-esteem). Both studies reported a positive impact of education support interventions on mental health; this was the only outcome for which the overall certainty of evidence was judged to be 'low' rather than 'very low'. No studies measured or reported quality of life or adverse effects. Risk of bias (selection, performance, detection, attrition, reporting and other bias) was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool for randomised trials (version 1). Overall risk of bias for all studies was assessed as 'high risk' because all studies had at least one domain at high risk of bias. Authors' conclusions: This review has demonstrated the infancy of quality research on the effectiveness of education support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions. At best, we can say that we are uncertain whether education support interventions improve either academic achievement or school engagement. Of the secondary outcomes, we are also uncertain whether education support interventions improve transition back to school, or school re-entry. However, we suggest there is some evidence that education support may slightly improve mental health, measured as self-esteem. Given the current state of the evidence of the effectiveness of education support interventions for children and adolescents with chronic health conditions, we highlight some important implications for future research in this field to strengthen the evidence that can inform effective practice and policy.

"This research aimed at investigating Sayyid Thanthawi's ijtihād pattern and methodology for deciding the law on making donations for church construction. As stated by Islamic teachings, Christians do not regard God to be One since they believe in the Trinity (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit). Within the national state, however, Muslims and Christians coexist, work together, and assist one another. Conflicts of interest in coexistence might emerge as a result of religious differences. This current study is library research using qualitative descriptive analysis. The data used were secondary data in the form of books written by Sheikh Sayyid Thanthawi, Mufti of the Arab Republic of Egypt, as well as other relevant books. This research found that from Sayyid Thanthawi's viewpoint, a Muslim is permitted to donate to the construction of a church. Sayyid Thanthawi's ijtihād is moderate since it considers the greater benefit and fosters harmony among religious communities, without ignoring the demands of the Qur'anic text. The ijtihād approach employed is the maṣlahah theory, which takes into account the benefits and harm that would be caused by the fatwa's issuing. The implication of this ijtihād is the establishment of concord and peace between Muslims and Christians in Egypt. However, some Egyptian religious scholars restrict donations to church construction, arguing that it is the same as donating to the development of gambling businesses and nightclubs. ©Universitas Islam Negeri Ar-Raniry.

"We’re in the midst of the “big data” age right now. Users generate enormous amounts of text data through a variety of means, including social media sites, e-commerce sites, and many kinds of scientific investigations. With this “Text data,” companies may have a better understanding of how the public perceives their brand and use that information to guide future business decisions. As a result, it is imperative for businesses to use sentiment social media data (Big data) to generate forecasts. Open-source big data tools and machine learning techniques are needed to process massive amounts of text data in real time. To this end, we developed a machine learning algorithm-based system for analyzing sentiment in large datasets. Here, the system for text analysis system reviews datasets utilizing the Apache Spark has been built and implemented utilizing the Nave Bayes and Support Vector Machines classification techniques. In addition, accuracy was used to gauge how well the algorithms worked. As demonstrated by these experiments, the Algorithms are quite effective at managing large sentiment datasets. This will be more useful for businesses, governments, & individuals to increase their value. © 2023, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved."
"This article is a review of the book The Evidential Model of a Scientific Text by Sergey Grichin. The monograph describes evidentiality, one of the leading discursive categories of a scientific text. Grichin answers the questions: How does new knowledge emerge? How is it converted into a text? How does the dialogue between the author and his predecessors come about? Answering these questions, Grichin substantiates the status of evidentiality as a universal text-forming category. This category reflects all cognitive actions of the author of the text, so the study of evidentiality requires a complex, interdisciplinary approach. In the reviewed book, this approach is represented by the synthesis of functional stylistics, cognitive linguistics, discourse analysis, psychology and logic. The author of the monograph fully and clearly formulates the research methodology and defines the key concepts: evidential sense, evidential unit, evidential indicators, etc. Grichin establishes the extra-linguistic factors influencing the representation of evidential meanings in a scientific text, and describes the linguistic units for expressing these meanings. The correlation between the category of evidentiality and the category of certainty / uncertainty is shown. Regularities in the perception of evidential information by the addressee are defined. The novelty of the research lies in the fact that the category of evidentiality is presented as an integrative, multifactor model, which takes into account extralinguistic (discursive) and linguistic factors of communicative and cognitive activity of the author of the text. The scientific significance of the developed model is ensured by the fact that Grichin interprets evidentiality in a wider and deeper way than it was accepted in traditional linguistics (traditionally evidentiality is understood as referring to the source of someone else’s speech). The monograph considers evidentiality as a multifactorial category, which is a tool for structuring scientific discourse. The evidentiality model is developed by Grichin on the basis of the analysis of vast material, which includes more than 300 texts in 13 branches of science. To check the validity of the concept, journalistic and colloquial (dialectal) texts are used in addition to scientific texts. The regularities of the addressee’s perception of evidential senses are analysed by means of experimental methods. The reviewers note the value of the monograph for speech studies, in particular: development of a cognitive and discursive method of scientific text analysis; identification of new extralinguistic factors of scientific communication; establishment of mechanisms of generation and perception of scientific texts. © 2023 Tomsk State University.

"[Objective] This paper proposes a fake news detection method based on the difference between news titles and contents, aiming to address the issues of extracting features from short news texts or retrieving comments. [Methods] Firstly, we designed the Cos-Gap calculation method to obtain the difference between news titles and contents’textual and emotional features. Then, we constructed a News Differential Heterogeneous Graph Network (NDHN) based on the obtained differential features and the Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks. The NDHN contains edges constructed based on differential features and nodes constructed based on semantic and emotional features of title, content, and emotion. [Results] We examined the proposed model on the GossipCop dataset and found that the NDHN can improve the classification accuracy by 2.7% and the F1 by 3.2%. [Limitations] This method is suitable for analyzing the news with title and has limitations for untitled texts from Sina Weibo or Twitter. [Conclusions] The new model could effectively detect fake news from social media. © 2023, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."
"Purpose About 25 % of the German population suffers from smoking. Although smoking cessation is one of the most effective approaches to reduce tobacco-related consequences, it is not well implemented in basic health care. Also, in GP practices it is only offered in a handful of cases. This study examines how GPs deal with the topic of smoking cessation and which factors hamper the implementation of smoking cessation. Methods Guided individual interviews were conducted with 13 GPs from teaching practices of the Institute of Family Medicine in Bonn. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Facilitated by MAXQDA the text document was analysed using thematic qualitative text analysis with deductive-inductive coding. Results GPs report different ways in which they implement smoking cessation in practice, describing combined interventions as most effective in practice. Nicotine replacement therapy and drug prescribing are reserved for heavy smokers with unsuccessful attempts to quit. In their experience, varenicline is effective and well tolerated. However, GPs report that they are cautious about using varenicline as they are afraid of side effects due to the warnings for the other cessation drug bupropion. According to the GPs the main barriers for smoking cessation are a lack of time in the practice, lack of patient motivation and the costs of medication. Conclusion The interviewed GPs concentrate on their motivated patients when applying smoking cessation. However, there is no structured treatment for nicotine addiction. As a consequence, the number of smoking interventions is low and effective therapies are rarely used. As a structured treatment is associated with a higher workload, there is a need for financial reward. In addition, GPs could be supported by providing more external smoking cessation services. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved."
"In the United States alone, approximately 2 billion tons of hazardous material products are manufactured each year for both household and industrial applications and contribute to thousands of worker chemical exposures with as many as 50,000 deaths from prolonged exposure each year. The potential hazards and impacts of these chemicals for human health and the environment are primarily communicated to the public through Safety Data Sheets (SDSs) from the chemical vendors or distributors. These documents provide a standardized approach for how and what information is provided to product users to assist them with assessment of precautionary measures, hazard mitigation, emergency response or cleanup procedures, and environmental, health, and safety (EHS) management. Despite the criticality for hazard communication (HAZCOM) precision, legacy SDS management and industry business practices leave the overall ability to effectively manage chemicals vulnerable to significant liability through a lack of full constituent disclosure, injection of data quality errors through various handling of SDS information and manual data entry, and the lack of direct SDS-to-product association. Chemical spills and accidents often require individuals to look for the appropriate SDS on a local computer, online, or in workplace binders; each of which results in information returned that is often found to be outdated or incorrect. Workplace HAZCOM violations remain among the top citations during EHS inspections by regulatory agencies. More important, however, is the lack of precise association of SDS to hazardous products that can occur through chemical management lifecycles. Incorrect SDSs can yield significant liability, as subsequent environmental and occupational health analyses and reporting are based upon incorrect and, in some cases, entirely different chemical formulations. This paper focuses on the need for a paradigm shift in our chemical management systems and how a standardized management system and various recent technological advances can be incorporated into Environmental Management System operations to reduce or eliminate these liabilities. The following advancements can be used to enhance the lifecycle management of workplace chemicals, reduce potential exposure and spill risks, reduce workplace hazards, and increase the efficiency and accuracy of environmental reporting through a more streamlined systems approach. EHS system enhancement applications discussed in this paper include the following: the need for a centralized universal SDS repository with full chemical disclosure of all product constituents and a nationally adopted machine language SDS standard. The use of artificial intelligence/machine learning in environmental systems and how they can be used as a medium to transition toward an automated standard by reverse-engineering and partitioning SDS components into machine-encoded text that can be validated and uploaded to a centralized repository. Algorithmic and meta-algorithmic approaches to SDS requirement and data validation, hazard characteristic code calculations, and determination of potentially less hazardous substitutions. Application of Natural Language Processing methods for real-time updates from scientific journals, regulatory agencies, and other reputable sources to produce “living” SDSs capable of informing users of relevant regulatory updates, news, and research. Embedded SDSs or SDS links in product barcodes with QR code reader technology to retrieve precise SDSs for each product in emergency situations. Use of advanced QR codes embedding authentication layers, authenticity verification, and alerts of potential product or inventory problems or discrepancies. Benefits of radio frequency identification technology in providing accurate SDS associations while also minimizing manual tracking of hazardous material and hazardous waste containers and monitoring for expired shelf life, incompatible storage, temperature sensitivities, and other inventory concerns. © 2023 The Authors.

"Background: The organ transplantation sector in China is facing a severe shortage of donors, and the organ donation rate needs to be increased. Since 2015, voluntary donation by citizens has become the only source of organs for transplantation in China. In recent years, there has been a relatively positive change in young people's attitudes toward organ donation after death. The aim of the study was to understand young people's perceptions and attitudes toward organ donation and the factors that influence them and can positively impact the promotion of organ donation. Methods: By analyzing relevant literature and legal texts, we developed a questionnaire. Information was obtained through questionnaires and interviews, and 501 valid questionnaires were returned from the target group. A chi-square test was used to examine whether there were significant differences in the willingness to organ donation among young people with different characteristics. A factor analysis was used to investigate the main factors influencing the different attitudes of young people toward organ donation, and a one-way ANOVA was used to examine whether young people with different characteristics were affected differently by different factors. Results: In our survey of young people aged 18–30 years, 99.2% of respondents knew about organ donation, 47.1% were willing to donate organs, and 15.2% understood that there were corresponding laws and regulations for organ donation. The study's findings showed that urban residents are more willing to be organ donators than rural residents; people with higher education levels have better awareness and are more willing to donate an organ; and people with religious beliefs are more likely to donate organs. The main factors that support the willingness of young people to donate are the social environment that provides support, their optimism in dealing with death, and their desire to realize their final value after death. The main factors for those unwilling to donate were low awareness or misconceptions about organ donation among individuals and their families and their attitudes toward death. As the people who took the questionnaire are probably interested in organ donation, the sample results will show a higher percentage of people who know about organ donation. We hope to discuss further with a larger and broader sample coverage to improve the estimates' validity and reflect the overall picture more accurately in a future study. Conclusion: Young people knew about organ donation but had a low depth of awareness. Household registration type, education level, and religious affiliation significantly correlate with people's willingness to donate. The supportive environment for organ donation in society and the correct understanding of the organ donation process and laws and regulations can influence people's willingness to donate.

"Background: Given the limited resources of health system, economic evaluations studies can provide appropriate evidences for resource allocation by clarifying the possible consequences of a decision. Present study aimed to evaluate the implemented approaches for economic evaluation studies of pharmacoeconomic in Iran. Methods: This study was carried out using the critical review method. All studies related to economic evaluation studies of pharmacoeconomic in Iran, indexed in PubMed and SID databases and Google Scholar search engine, were searched by using appropriate keywords and search strategies until 2021. Further, published papers from Iranian researchers in the field of health economics and pharmacoeconomics and pharmaceutical administration were extracted with the scientometric system of the Health Ministry. Then, retrieved papers were screened by title, abstract, and the whole text. Finally, papers were evaluated by applying the Drummond quality assessment checklist, and finally appropriate ones were selected. Finally, 29 papers were selected and analyzed. Results: Out of total available papers (n=1324), 29 papers had inclusion criteria to evaluate. The selected papers were analyzed based on 10 parameters, including type of analysis, type of comparator, source of clinical effectiveness, time horizon, used model, perspective of the analysis, measured expected outcomes, discounting of costs and outcomes, sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis. Most studies have used cost utility analysis. Shortcomings were found in some aspects as follows: some studies did not mention the applied model, or the time horizon. Moreover, some studies had time horizon more than one year, while the cost and consequences were not discounted. Conclusion: In recent years, economic evaluation studies in the field of pharmacoeconomic in Iran have been center attention in line with global trend. In order to make a decision regarding the allocation of resources based on the findings of economic evaluation studies, these studies should be conducted with the systematic and transparent approach. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a standard framework for implementing and reporting the results of economic evaluation studies in Iran. Copyright © 2023 Emamgholipour et al.

"The relationship between human visual experience and evoked neural activity is central to the field of computational neuroscience. The purpose of visual neural encoding and decoding is to study the relationship between visual stimuli and the evoked neural activity by using neuroimaging data such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neural encoding researches attempt to predict the brain activity according to the presented external stimuli, which contributes to the development of brain science and brain-like artificial intelligence. Neural decoding researches attempt to predict the information about external stimuli by analyzing the observed brain activities, which can interpret the state of human visual perception and promote the development of brain computer interface (BCI). Therefore, fMRI based visual neural encoding and decoding researches have important scientific significance and engineering value. Typically, the encoding models are based on the specific computations that are thought to underlie the observed brain responses for specific visual stimuli. Early studies of visual neural encoding relied heavily on Gabor wavelet features because these features are very good at modeling brain responses in the primary visual cortex. Recently, given the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in classifying objects in natural images, the representations within these networks have been used to build encoding models of cortical responses to complex visual stimuli. Most of the existing decoding studies are based on multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) method, but brain connectivity pattern is also a key feature of the brain state and can be used for brain decoding. Although recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of decoding the identity of binary contrast patterns, handwritten characters, human facial images, natural picture/video stimuli and dreams from the corresponding brain activation patterns, the accurate reconstruction of the visual stimuli from fMRI still lacks adequate examination and requires plenty of efforts to improve. On the basis of summarizing the key technologies and research progress of fMRI based visual neural encoding and decoding, this paper further analyzes the limitations of existing visual neural encoding and decoding methods. In terms of visual neural encoding, the development process of population receptive field (pRF) estimation method is introduced in detail. In terms of visual neural decoding, it is divided into semantic classification, image identification and image reconstruction according to task types, and the representative research work of each part and the methods used are described in detail. From the perspective of machine learning, semantic classification is a single label or multi-label classification problem. Simple visual stimuli only contain a single object, while natural visual stimuli often contain multiple semantic labels. For example, an image may contain flowers, water, trees, cars, etc. Predicting one or more semantic labels of the visual stimulus from the brain signal is called semantic decoding. Image retrieval based on brain signal is also a common visual decoding task where the model is created to “decode” neural activity by retrieving a picture of what a person has just seen or imagined. In particular, the reconstruction techniques of simple image, face image and complex natural image based on deep generative models (including variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs)) are introduced in the part of image reconstruction. Secondly, 10 open source datasets commonly used in this field were statistically sorted out, and the sample size, number of subjects, types of stimuli, research purposes and download links of the datasets were summarized in detail. These datasets have made important contributions to the development of this field. Finally, we introduce the commonly used measurement metrics of visual neural encoding and decoding model in detail, analyze the shortcomings of current visual neural encoding and decoding methods, propose feasible suggestions for improvement, and show the future development directions. Specifically, for neural encoding, the existing methods still have the following shortcomings: 1) the computational models are mostly based on the existing neural network architecture, which cannot reflect the real biological visual information flow; 2) due to the selective attention of each person in the visual perception and the inevitable noise in the fMRI data collection, individual differences are significant; 3) the sample size of the existing fMRI data set is insufficient; 4) most researchers construct feature spaces of neural encoding models based on fixed types of pre-trained neural networks (such as AlexNet), causing problems such as insufficient diversity of visual features. On the other hand, although the existing visual neural decoding methods perform well in the semantic classification and image identification tasks, it is still very difficult to establish an accurate mapping between visual stimuli and visual neural signals, and the results of image reconstruction are often blurry and lack of clear semantics. Moreover, most of the existing visual neural decoding methods are based on linear transformation or deep network transformation of visual images, lacking exploration of new visual features. Factors that hinder researchers from effectively decoding visual information and reconstructing images or videos mainly include high dimension of fMRI data, small sample size and serious noise. In the future, more advanced artificial intelligence technology should be used to develop more effective methods of neural encoding and decoding, and try to translate brain signals into images, video, voice, text and other multimedia content, so as to achieve more BCI applications. The significant research directions include 1) multi-modal neural encoding and decoding based on the union of image and text; 2) brain-guided computer vision model training and enhancement; 3) visual neural encoding and decoding based on the high efficient features of large-scale pre-trained models. In addition, since brain signals are characterized by complexity, high dimension, large individual diversity, high dynamic nature and small sample size, future research needs to combine computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence theories to develop visual neural encoding and decoding methods with higher robustness, adaptability and interpretability. © 2023 Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG.

"Studies suggest that the lack of diversity in the science workforce may be partially attributed to implicit bias. Collectively, implicit biases are ingrained among youth from their upbringing, culture, and media, which are subsequently reflected in their language choices. Reform efforts made in post-secondary science education have targeted implicit bias by challenging the use of gendered language (he, she) and modeling gender inclusive language. However, the impact of such reforms are unexplored among K-12 aged learners. Utilizing the theoretical lens of implicit cognition, student-produced text within 288 primary (n = 47) and secondary (n = 241) Draw a Scientist Tests (DASTs) were analyzed using critical discourse analysis to explore how gender-exclusive language (GEL) and gender-inclusive language (GIL) was used by students when describing scientists. Findings suggest that middle school boys were most likely to use GIL, whereas high school girls were the least likely to use GIL. However, when specifying gender, elementary boys were most likely to use male-exclusive language, and high school girls were the most likely to use female-exclusive language. Further analyses suggest that students' implicit perceptions of scientists (character traits, academic behaviors, the field of study) were influenced by their gender, grade level, and the scientist's perceived gender or gender neutrality. © 2023 School Science and Mathematics Association."

"Introduction With the worsening of population ageing globally, the number of the elderly with chronic and incurable diseases such as malignant tumours is gradually increasing, and the need for palliative care is growing. As a primary task in the end-of-life phase, symptom management is an essential aspect of palliative care, which aims to alleviate distressing symptoms of terminally ill patients and improve their quality of life. Virtual reality (VR) technology, which allows the creation of simulated environments in which a three-dimensional experience is generated, has been increasingly used in palliative care for symptom management. Therefore, we aim to conduct a systematic review to investigate the effects of VR-based interventions on end-of-life patients. Methods and analysis This protocol for conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis will be prepared following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 statement. We will conduct a series of searches from inception to 31 July 2022 in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, JBI, EBSCO, CNKI, Wanfang and SinoMed. The key concepts of virtual reality' and end-of-life' will be combined in each database using both free-text terms and controlled vocabulary terms (eg, MeSH/Emtree terms), if available. Two independent reviewers will use raw data to explore the effectiveness of VR for symptom management in end-of-life patients. The Cochrane Risk-of-Bias tool will be used to assess the risk of bias of included studies. Disagreements will be resolved by a third independent reviewer to reach a consensus. For the included articles, Review Manager software will be used for data synthesis and I 2 statistics will be used to measure the heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses will be used to identify the source of heterogeneity. Ethics and dissemination As this is a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis, patients will not be included in this study. For this reason, ethical approval is not required. In order to disseminate the research findings, the results and conclusions of this review will be submitted to a worldwide journal.

"Pearl River Delta is the most densely populated and urbanized area in China. As the pilot area of reform and opening up, Pearl River Delta takes the lead in its urbanization in China and represents the development trend of China's urbanization. Therefore, a great number and diversity of previous studies on urbanization in the Pearl River Delta warrant further review and reflection. This study focused on publications about urbanization in the Pearl River Delta from 1983 to 2020 in the collection of Chinese core journals and dissertations in the China Academic Journals Full-text Database (CNKI). The quantitative characteristics of published papers, the scientific cooperation network of core authors and institutions, research topics, and historical research hotspots were analyzed for different periods through bibliometrics and mapping knowledge domains based on CiteSpace. Results indicated that: (1) the number of publications of the relevant research showed an upward trend, which was divided into the following four stages: initial (1983-1991), exploratory (1992-2002), prosperity (2003-2011), and deep cultivation (2012-2020) stages. (2) The research institutions gradually expanded from south China universities, with Sun Yat-sen University emerging as the core to form a national network of research collaboration, and the scholar network has expanded from occasional collaboration to form a variety of cooperation networks within and across institutions. (3) In the evolution process of knowledge, research topics that scholars focused on included economic zone, rural urbanization, urban agglomeration, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay area, new-type urbanization, innovation, while other historical hotspots that scholars focused on included economic zone, new-type urbanization, and Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay area. (4) The research showed the characteristics of policy and practice orientations, the continuous expansion of vision and scope, and the theoretical research stages evolving from lag to advance and then to synchronization. After the urbanization development stage of a metropolitan circle and urban agglomeration was jointly entered, the theoretical construction of localization was slightly insufficient, and that of the people-oriented urbanization mode was lacking. (5) Pearl River Delta entered the regional urbanization stage, with the metropolitan areas and urban agglomerations being the main body. The driving force of urbanization development shifted to scientific and technological innovation, while the development features shifted to intensive, high-quality, and people-oriented urbanization. Finally, this study argued that future studies on urbanization in Pearl River Delta should focus on the theoretical and practical pathways of the coordinated development of urban agglomeration in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay area, innovation-driven development strategy, and people-oriented urbanization. © 2023 TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY.

"This article interrogates the historiography of the field of classical Judaism and suggests what a revisionist feminist historiography of this foundational period might look like. Feminist analysis of gender, class, and race in antiquity allows us to see how scholarly biases today reinscribe and even exceed ancient prejudices. Building on Blossom Stefaniw's essay ""Feminist Historiography and Uses of the Past""and deploying Saidiya Hartman's method of critical fabulation to analyze synagogue inscriptions and rabbinic texts, this article offers counternarratives of Jewish daily life in the period of Late Antiquity. Through investigation of evidence for enslaved, manumitted, and fostered people in the households of the late antique Jewish patriarchs, this article emphasizes the contribution of ostensibly nonnormative Jews to late antique synagogues, rabbinic learning, and Jewish society in Late Antiquity. It argues that our imaginings of Jewish society and the Jewish household in premodernity must change to accommodate the evidence of these heretofore marginalized Jews and the challenges posed by their enslaved status and/or gendered identity. This restoration of excluded perspectives and traditions represents a more ethical historiographic practice, which produces more inclusive and accurate representations of the past, sets the stage for recognizing continuities through the medieval era, and, finally, enables a different present, one with subjects empowered to construct more ethical social norms within and outside the academy.  © 2023 by the Regents of the University of California."
"Purpose: During the COVID-19 outbreak, clinical schools across the UK were forced to switch their learning from face-to-face to online platforms. This paper aims to describe the experiences of psychiatry teachers and medical students at Cambridge University of the online psychiatry case-based tutorials during the COVID-19 outbreak and the lessons learned from this implementation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted qualitative focus groups with students followed by in-depth individual interviews with students and teachers. Findings: In a data-led systematic text condensation analysis, this study found seven themes: the COVID-19 context, the structure of the course, teachers’ educational ethos, beyond the (teaching) script, possibilities for learning or teaching reflective practice, attitudes to online learning and suggestions for future development. The authors then applied the normalisation process theory (NPT) as the theoretical frame of reference. This model has previously been applied to the implementation of telemedicine in psychiatry, to understand how new technology can become embedded in clinical care. Originality/value: This study’s results show how the NPT model can be modified to support the delivery of medical education online, including reflective learning and practice as an iterative process at every stage of the implementation and delivery of the teaching. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"[Objective] This paper builds an automated detection model to effectively identify mis/dis-information from social media, aiming to balance the speed and accuracy of processing massive data. [Methods] The classification model is the mainstream processing technique to detect for mis/dis-information. However, most of them could not extract deep semantic features from the texts. Therefore, we used the single text feature BFID model (BERT False-Information-Detection) as the benchmark model, and proposed two new methods with fused semantic enhancement to detect the mis/dis-information. [Results] We examined the new models with data from Sina Weibo. The accuracy of the model based on fused sentiment feature BFID-SEN (BFID-Sentiment) increased about 1.59 percentage point, while the accuracy of model with fused image feature BFID-IMG (BFID-Image) model improved by 0.78 percentage point. [Limitations] The ability to fuse semantic enhancement is limited due to the small corpus size, sentiment categories and multimodal disinformation training datasets. [Conclusions] The proposed methods are able to more effectively identify false information from social media. © 2023, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."
"This article seeks to address the question of how membership in the European Union (EU) affects the foreign policy positions of its Member States. Most of the existing research has focused on single case studies and relied on qualitative methods, encountering difficulties in providing a systematic and consistent general picture about the causal effect of membership. Instead, this study adopts a comprehensive and quantitative approach. Drawing from constructivist theory in International Relations, it clarifies a general theoretical framework for Foreign Policy Europeanization. It then employs national speeches at the United Nations General Debate to construct two measures of similarity with the EU's positions and norms in international affairs. Applying these to a difference-in-differences approach, it finds substantial evidence that, after several years of membership, countries gradually converge towards the positions and norms of the Union. It is argued that these overall findings are consistent with a socialization effect, but not with material cost-benefit calculations. © 2023 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands."
"This text is an analysis of a series of pinhole photographs, by Anne Peschken and Marek Pisarsky (Urban Art), entitled East Side Story I (Myślibórz). Photo research on migration and arrival stories, 2019 on-going. The main thesis is that these photographs are a model example of images which, while addressing the theme of migration in the representational layer, also activate the processual and migratory nature of visual forms themselves. In order to substantiate this thesis, the East Side Story project is examined in the following contexts: critical border (art) studies; H. Belting’s anthropology of the image; memory studies; re-enactment; the blurriness of images made with a pinhole camera; A. Berleant’s re-thinking aesthetics and the notion of aesthetic embodiment. Reflecting on the tension between history, memory, identity and politics and activating the critical potential of borderscaping, Peschken and Pisarsky transform the landscape of the Polish-German borderland into an anachronistic narrative agent. The photographs from the East Side Story series are thus transgenerational corpographies of memory, showing that migration is a key and inalienable element of Polish history. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The text explains the main themes and conceptual arguments of the thematic issue on the reception of Ratzel's spatial theories in Italy, France, Germany and the USA. The work and impact of Friedrich Ratzel between 1880 and 1945 are examined in the perspective of a history of transformation based on the history of knowledge. As a result, the case studies demonstrate that Ratzel's work had an international impact on the object constitution of the academic subject of geography, firstly through the later widespread geopolitical theorising, secondly with regard to the conceptualisation of anthropogeography and thirdly in the relationship of the discipline to the formation of nation states, territorial rule and colonial expansion. Equally decisive is that some interpretations of Ratzel's writings turn out to be rather appropriations of already existing receptions of his work. This reception of reception is undoubtedly a key element of a differentiated impact analysis.  © Copyright: "
"Background: Receiving a breast cancer diagnosis and treatment is both a physical and emotional journey. Previous studies using single-source data have revealed common and culture-specific emotional experiences of patients living with breast cancer. However, few studies have combined such data from multiple sources. Thus, using a variety of data sources, the current study sought to explore the emotional experiences of women in China newly diagnosed, post-operative, or undergoing chemotherapy. We posited that even though women living with breast cancer in China have multiple channels through which they can express these emotional experiences, little variance would be found in their emotional expressivity and the themes they want to express due to cultural inhibitions. Methods: Text data from female patients newly diagnosed, post-operative, or undergoing chemotherapy were collected between June 2021 and January 2022 via a Python web crawler, semi-structured interviews, and an expressive writing intervention. Data were transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis. Reporting followed the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies (COREQ) guidelines. Results: Analyses were based on 5,675 Weibo posts and comments published by 448 posters and 1,842 commenters, transcription texts from 17 semi-structured interviews, and 150 expressive writing texts. From this total collection of 461,348 Chinese characters, three major themes emerged: (i) conflicting emotions after diagnosis; (ii) long-term suffering and treatment concerns; and (iii) benefit finding and cognitive reappraisal. Conclusions: Despite gathering information from various sources, we found that distress from body-image disturbances, gender role loss and conflict, and changes in sexuality and fertility, were consistent among this sample of female Chinese patients with breast cancer. However, when women engaged actively in benefit finding and cognitive reappraisal with strong social support, patients were able to find ways to adapt and reported post-traumatic growth. Strong social support was an important facilitator in this growth. These study findings emphasize that healthcare professionals ought to increase cultural sensitivity, provide multiple channels to encourage patients to express their emotions, and incorporate screening for patients' emotional distress at all diagnostic and treatment phases as part of routine nursing care.

"Background and Objective: Heart failure (HF) in the pediatric population is a multi-factorial process with a wide spectrum of etiologies and clinical manifestations, that are distinct from the adult HF population, with congenital heart disease (CHD) as the most common cause. CHD has high morbidity/mortality with nearly 60% developing HF during the first 12 months of life. Hence, early discovery and diagnosis of CHD in neonates is pivotal. Plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an increasingly popular clinical marker in pediatric HF, however, in contrast to adult HF, it is not yet included in pediatric HF guidelines and there is no standardized reference cut-off value. We explore the current trends and prospects of biomarkers in pediatric HF, including CHD that can aid in diagnosis and management. Methods: As a narrative review, we will analyze biomarkers with respect to diagnosis and monitoring in specific anatomical types of CHD in the pediatric population considering all English PubMed publications till June 2022. Key Content and Findings: We present a concise description of our own experience in applying plasma BNP as a clinical biomarker in pediatric HF and CHD (tetralogy of fallot vs. ventricular septal defect) in the context of surgical correction, as well as untargeted metabolomics analyses. In the current age of Information Technology and large data sets we also explored new biomarker discovery using Text Mining of 33M manuscripts currently on PubMed. Conclusions: (Multi) Omics studies from patient samples as well as Data Mining can be considered for the discovery of potential pediatric HF biomarkers useful in clinical care. Future research should focus on validation and defining evidence-based value limits and reference ranges for specific indications using the most up-to-date assays in parallel to commonly used studies. © Cardiovascular Diagnosis and Therapy.

"Background: The Alvarado score (AS) has not been widely used for diagnosing acute appendicitis although it has shown to be a good predictor for diagnosing appendicitis. The aim was to perform a systematic review of the available literature and synthesize the evidence. Methods: A systematic review was performed as per the PRISMA guidelines using search engines like Ovid, PubMed, and Google Scholar with predefined, strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The quality assessment of included studies was performed using the QUADAS 2 tool. Summary statistics were performed for all variables. A linear regression model was performed between dependent and independent variables using STATA software. Heterogeneity testing showed significant heterogeneity within the included studies; hence, a forest plot with pooled estimates could not be constructed, and therefore a meta-regression was performed. Results: Seventeen full-text articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Ten of which were identified as low-risk studies. Five studies were included in final data pooling with total patients being 2239 and mean age of 31.9 years. (1) Linear regression demonstrated an association between 'histological appendicitis' and 'AS 7-0' with patients receiving intervention, with a significant P value of less than 0.005. (2) Meta-regression demonstrated a positive coefficient (0.298), a positive Z score of 2.20 with a significant P value of 0.028 for patients with 'high AS' who received interventions that were significantly proven to be 'histologically appendicitis', indicating a cause-and-effect relationship. Conclusion: High AS (7 and above) is a significant predictor of acute appendicitis. The authors recommend further prospective randomized clinical trials to establish a cause-and-effect relationship.

"BACKGROUND: Hundreds of randomised controlled trials and dozens of meta-analyses have examined psychotherapies for depression-yet not all points in the same direction. Are these discrepancies a result of specific meta-analytical decisions or do most analytical strategies reaching the same conclusion? OBJECTIVE: We aim to solve these discrepancies by conducting a multiverse meta-analysis containing all possible meta-analyses, using all statistical methods. STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: We searched four bibliographical databases (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials), including studies published until 1 January 2022. We included all randomised controlled trials comparing psychotherapies with control conditions without restricting the type of psychotherapy, target group, intervention format, control condition and diagnosis. We defined all possible meta-analyses emerging from combinations of these inclusion criteria and estimated the resulting pooled effect sizes with fixed-effect, random-effects, 3-level, robust variance estimation, p-uniform and PET-PEESE (precision-effect test and precision-effect estimate with SE) meta-analysis models. This study was preregistered (https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-050197). FINDINGS: A total of 21 563 records were screened, and 3584 full texts were retrieved; 415 studies met our inclusion criteria containing 1206 effect sizes and 71 454 participants. Based on all possible combinations between inclusion criteria and meta-analytical methods, we calculated 4281 meta-analyses. The average summary effect size for these meta-analyses was Hedges' gmean=0.56, a medium effect size, and ranged from g=-0.66 to 2.51. In total, 90% of these meta-analyses reached a clinically relevant magnitude. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The multiverse meta-analysis revealed the overall robustness of the effectiveness of psychotherapies for depression. Notably, meta-analyses that included studies with a high risk of bias, compared the intervention with wait-list control groups, and not correcting for publication bias produced larger effect sizes. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"The article analyses the essay “Waiting for the Passage-Boat” (1857) by the Russian writer and publicist Dmitry Vasilyevich Grigorovich. The essay was published in the magazine Sovremennik (“Contemporary”), and its publication seemed to draw a line under the discussion of the slaver and serfdom question in Russian magazines. Grigorovich’s prose played a role in this discussion. Grigorovich was one of the first writers of Russian realism (the so-called “natural school”) and tried to move away from the theatre vaudeville and sentimental images of Russian peasants in his novellas The Village and Anton-Goremyka. His subsequent texts on peasant themes, written during the “gloomy seven years”, varied the source material, sometimes showing a movement towards melodrama. The article offers a variant of a narratological and hermeneutic reading of the essay in the aspect of reflection and narration. In the author’s opinion, Grigorovich demonstrates the exhaustion of the peasant theme in literature, using the technique of multiple storytelling (from Hoffmann’s Serapion Brothers or Odoevsky’s Russian Nights). This becomes most obvious at that moment of the narrative, when the “right to voice” passes to casual interlocutors, while the narrator, correlated with the writer, loses this right. He is not recognized as the author of stories in his environment and takes the passive role of a listener. The use of allusions, remeniscences (from Karamzin, Radishchev, Mérimée, de Prevost), and auto-quotation creates “noise” in the communication channel, making it difficult to perceive these stories as “bitter truth” (Stendhal), at the same time convincing the reader of the impossibility of finding an adequate description language for peasant everyday life. In this regard, Grigorovich’s position coincides with that of Honore de Balzac in the introduction to his Les Paysans or of Pavel Annenkov that was declared in his main article: you can expect a lot of pleasure from the expression in art of the course of common life, many pictures, original faces, excellent descriptions, but hardly real knowledge of this course as a subject for discussion and conclusion. Yet many of the writers and a very large number of readers have in mind this latter goal; but it is the same as judging about the height of the people who built the Egyptian pyramid by the pyramid’s height. This epistemological impossibility is illustrated in Grigorovich’s essay: the nobles and the peasant world exist in parallel. Thus, interlocutors do not feel empathy, and the purpose of conversation is not to change reality, but to spend time. Thus, the conversation of the nobles can be correlated with the Socratic dialogue, in which the possibility of the maieutic acquisition of truth is not realized due to the failure of communication. The arrival of the passage-boat demonstrates the inconsistency and exhaustion of conversations about people’s happiness, becomes a marker of such a failure. The article is illustrated with fragments of critical articles and epistolary works by Grigorovich. whose 200th anniversary inspires researchers to search for the latest interpretations and update the ways of reading the writer’s texts. Results and observations that are presented in the article can be used in teaching the history of 19th-century Russian literature. © 2023 Tomsk State University. All rights reserved."
"The famous Moroccan traveller Muahammad b. Battuta, who left Tangier in 1325, claims to have made a journey that took him across most of the then Islamicate world. The country in which he recounts having stayed the longest was India, where he says he remained from 1333 to 1341/1342, mostly in the Islamic Sultanate of Delhi. A long section of his Riahla is dedicated to the sub-continent and modern historians of this region ascribe to it an important documentary value, although it has been argued that Ibn Battuta may have borrowed - not to imply copied - information from other sources in other parts of the work. As concerns India, Ibn Battuta speaks of two epidemics and one deadly disease that occurred in 1334-5 and 1344. Some scholars have referred to them as cholera, while others have suggested it was the plague - thus supporting the hypothesis that the medieval plague pandemic had struck India before reaching the Middle East. How did this confusion arise? What exactly does Ibn Battuta's Riahla relate? Do Indo-Persian sources confirm these epidemics? Do they and/or Ibn Battuta's Riahla allow us to discount the presence of the Medieval Plague in India, or rather do they assert it? In order to answer these questions, this paper analyses the information on the Indian epidemics in Ibn Battuta's Riahla and compares the text with its translations in the principal European languages and with Indo-Persian chronicles. These analyses reveal something of a lexical muddle which, in my opinion, has contributed to some errors and misunderstandings regarding the diseases in question. But another question arises: is it possible to read the information provided by Ibn Battuta and the Indian chronicles in a consilient way, that is, taking into account not only the analysis of written documents, but also the recent and current findings in genetics of plague, and in particular on the Black Death? Finally, an attempt is made to answer a question that has to be asked, particularly in light of the criticism often levelled at Ibn Battuta. Considering that in one of these events he claims to have witnessed the epidemic, is there any reason to suppose that he did not? Regarding the other two events that he did not claim to witness firsthand, is there any cause to doubt his claims?  Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

"In this paper we challenge a staple of modern scholarship, which considers Hippias’ Synagogé as the first instance of Greek doxographical work. In this article, I offer a fresh analysis of the relevant ancient texts and of the state of scholarship. The result of this investigation casts doubt on the real nature and scope of Hippias’ Synagogé as a mere collection of passages. I argue that this usually taken for granted interpretation does not capture what the Synagogé may have been. By contrast, I suggest restoring the entertaining nature and rhetorical strategy that lie at the heart of Hippias’ literary effort. © 2023 Classical Association of the Middle West and South, Inc..

"Purpose: There is ambiguity regarding whether coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a boon or bane for the IT services industry. On the one hand, it has created opportunities, especially with the growth of collaborative technologies. On the other hand, many firms have reduced their IT budgets owing to the ongoing recession. This study explores how IT firms have assessed the risk of the pandemic in the early days and informed capital market participants. In addition, it examines the impact of such online disclosures on information asymmetry. Design/methodology/approach: The authors analysed annual reports of publicly listed firms in the USA filed on the Securities and Exchange Commission website in 2020 and examined whether the disclosure scenario of technology firms was different from that of the other industries. Moreover, the risk sentiment of COVID-19-related disclosures was assessed by employing text analytics. Information asymmetry was measured using the bid–ask spread. Findings: Overall, it was found that IT services firms were less likely to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic in their annual reports. Interestingly, it was observed that technology firms that chose to communicate about the pandemic had a lower incidence of words related to risks. Furthermore, communicating about COVID-19 in annual reports calms investors and improves the information asymmetry situation about the firm. Variation in the severity of the pandemic and the responses of state governments was controlled for by employing state-fixed effects in the empirical models. Originality/value: The authors inform the literature on corporate disclosures and technology and highlight the importance of effectively communicating about the pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Abstract: The quality of water is usually identified according to its physical, chemical and biological characteristics. The degradation of groundwater quality in a coastal region due to natural processes such as saline water intrusion, wind-driven sea spray and marine aerosols, and interaction of groundwater. This paper aim to perform water quality assessment to determine the effects of saltwater intrusion and groundwater suitability for domestic and agricultural applications. This assessment reports utilizing geographic information system (GIS) and ions geochemistry for appraisal of the groundwater quality around Mallipattinam coastal region, Thanjavur District, Tamil Nadu. There was a meaningful relationship exist among electrical conductivity, chloride, sodium, magnesium and sulphate with total dissolved solids concentrations of groundwater. This study investigates the interaction between groundwater and saltwater from empirical data collected in 15 locations around Mallipattinam coastal region, parameters namely Na+, $${\text{SO}}_{4}^{{2 - }}$$ and Cl− are responsible for the electrical conductivity (EC) variability in groundwater samples. When comparing our results with potable water quality standards described by various establishments, it had been found that concerning 60% sample water don’t seem to be appropriate for consumption purposes. The correlation coefficient for certain variables was performed in this study. EC, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), chloride had a meaningful relationship amongst themselves and also with Na+, K+ and sulphate. Fluoride and nitrates exist no meaningful correlations with any of the parameters. Chloride also positively correlated with TDS, EC, Na+ and $${\text{SO}}_{4}^{{2 - }}$$. Sodium exhibited a positive correlation with K+, Cl− and $${\text{SO}}_{4}^{{2 - }}$$. The groundwater taken for analysis is categorized as a normal sulfate and chloride type. Hydrochemical groundwater analysis showed that a maximum number of groundwaters belong to the Na+-K+-Cl−-$${\text{SO}}_{4}^{{2 - }}$$ category. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."
"Although the number of people with dementia has been increasing rapidly in the Chinese-speaking world, there are relatively few Chinese children’s books published on the topic. This article analyses two Chinese-language picturebooks that approach the representation of dementia in contrasting ways. Azihaimo xiansheng [Mr Alzheimer] (2017) by Chen Yihui and Xue Huiying downplays the threat of the disease by anthropomorphising it as a friendly man while Zhanxin de yitian [A NewDay] (2017) by Guo Yu and Lianggen creates a surrealist nightmarish vision of what a person with dementia feels like daily. The article argues that, although the former book romanticises dementia while the latter presents it as a terrifying condition, both texts infantilise the person with dementia, thus reinforcing ageist tropes. © International Research Society for Children’s Literature."
"Background: Accurate measurement of food-related parenting practices is necessary to inform related interventions and program evaluation. Valid tools reflect cultural attributes that affect household food environments and feeding practices. Simple, unidirectional language adaptation approaches are insufficient to capture these attributes in assessment tools. My Child at Mealtime (MCMT) is a 27-item, validated, visually enhanced self-assessment tool to measure food-related parenting practices of low-income English-speaking parents of preschoolers. Objectives: The aim of this study was to describe the cross-cultural adaptation of MCMT into its Spanish version Mi Niño a la Hora the Comer (Mi Niño) and to establish its face validity, factor structure, and internal consistency. Methods: MCMT was adapted into its Spanish version after an iterative process that triangulated cognitive interviews with verification of conceptual equivalence by content experts to establish face validity and semantic equivalence. The resulting tool underwent confirmatory factor analysis to determine whether internal consistency was equivalent across the 2 versions. Results: Four rounds of cognitive interviews (n = 5, n = 6, n = 2, and n = 4, respectively) with Spanish-speaking women caregivers of children aged 3–5 y recruited from Head Start were conducted. Ten items were modified throughout the adaptation process. Modifications included improved clarity (6 items), comprehension (7 items), appropriateness (4 items), suitability (4 items), and usefulness (2 items) of text and/or accompanying visuals. Confirmatory factor analysis with a sample of Spanish-speaking caregivers (n = 243) resulted in 2 reliable factors representing “child-centered” (α = 0.82) and “parent-centered” (α = 0.87) food-related parenting practices. Conclusions: Face validity, semantic equivalence, and internal consistency of Mi Niño were established. This tool can be used in community settings to inform program content and measure changes in food-related parenting practices of Spanish-speaking parents and assist in setting food-related parenting goals. The next steps include exploring the correspondence of Mi Nino with mealtime behaviors observed through video recording. © 2023 The Authors"
"The ""material genome project"" is mainly to change the ""trial and error"" mode of material research. Through the collection and sorting of previous experimental data, combined with simulation computing technology and information technologies such as big data and blockchain, it can establish the basic database, big data management platform, high-throughput simulation computing, experiment and analysis platform of materials, and introduce advanced AI technology such as machine learning to provide effective data support for the rapid development of high-performance new materials. According to the data processing requirement in ultra-high strength steel research, the genome database of ultra-high strength steel and its management platform are established based on the basic data collection and high flux simulation calculation of ultra-high strength steel. It presents the structural framework of database system and the overall architecture of genome data management platform, and shows some applications developed on this platform, such as integrating experimental data to form experiment report, parsing computing data to form customized visualization, and so on. This platform can accommodate various data type, including numeric, text, rich text, table, function, image, etc. and support the storage and management of TB-level mass data and the index and retrieve of million-level data records. It can implement the intelligent management of the whole process from online collection, normalized processing, storing and managing to retrieving and analyzing, so as to provide requisite data supporting for the research work of ultra-high strength steel. As a result, the platform can effectively improve the data utilization and analysis capability of research group and provide high-quality data services for developing new ultrahigh strength steel. © 2023 Chinese Society for Metals.

"The peculiarities of a new stage in Russian traditional popular culture, dating from the first half of the 20th century, when many dialect speakers began to read and write, require to study the influence that is exerted on oral dialect communication by written speech. Today, in dialect speech, we need to distinguish the features originated from the oral character of this form of communication from the unwritten character of folk speech culture as a foundation of dialect communication, and from the inclusion of written components in the language consciousness of dialect speakers. The analysed material is the speech of dialect speaking Old Believers from the village Belogornoe in Saratov Oblast; the object of observation is the peculiarities of inclusion of written culture elements into the dialect speech; the main research method is the text-based analysis of dialect speech. Literate dialect speaking Old Believers’ speech is typically dialectal – by its phonetic and grammatical structure, its lexical specificity, its communicative organization, as well as from the point of view of verbalized features distinguishing the dialect speakers’ consciousness. At the same time, the informants’ speech represents a specific synthesis of oral dialect communication features with penetrating elements of bookish and written discourses, mainly religious one. The interaction of the dialect speech basis with other discursive elements can be seen in the lexical composition of dialect speaking Old Believers’ speech, in the manner of coping with the inclusions from other discourses, in the functioning of heterogeneous language units, as well as in the forms of linguistic reflection. While remaining basically dialectal with its non-functional variability as a distinguishing feature of dialectal communication, the speech of literate dialect speakers is characterized by some elements of linguistic means’ functional distribution and by the strengthening of meta-linguistic reflection. The authors conclude that changes in dialect communication, connected with the expansion of literacy among dialect speakers, have a variable character. They are determined by the source of literacy and by the circle of written texts constituting the communicative space of a dialect speaker. The peculiarities of synthesizing written culture with the Old Believers’ dialect speech are a variant of the general dynamics of folk speech tradition. © 2023 Tomsk State University.

"Objectives To identify ML tools in hospital settings and how they were implemented to inform decision-making for patient care through a scoping review. We investigated the following research questions: What ML interventions have been used to inform decision-making for patient care in hospital settings? What strategies have been used to implement these ML interventions? Design A scoping review was undertaken. MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) were searched from 2009 until June 2021. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts, full-text articles, and charted data independently. Conflicts were resolved by another reviewer. Data were summarised descriptively using simple content analysis. Setting Hospital setting. Participant Any type of clinician caring for any type of patient. Intervention Machine learning tools used by clinicians to inform decision-making for patient care, such as AI-based computerised decision support systems or "" € model-based'""decision support systems. Primary and secondary outcome measures Patient and study characteristics, as well as intervention characteristics including the type of machine learning tool, implementation strategies, target population. Equity issues were examined with PROGRESS-PLUS criteria. Results After screening 17 386 citations and 3474 full-text articles, 20 unique studies and 1 companion report were included. The included articles totalled 82 656 patients and 915 clinicians. Seven studies reported gender and four studies reported PROGRESS-PLUS criteria (race, health insurance, rural/urban). Common implementation strategies for the tools were clinician reminders that integrated ML predictions (44.4%), facilitated relay of clinical information (17.8%) and staff education (15.6%). Common barriers to successful implementation of ML tools were time (11.1%) and reliability (11.1%), and common facilitators were time/efficiency (13.6%) and perceived usefulness (13.6%). Conclusions We found limited evidence related to the implementation of ML tools to assist clinicians with patient healthcare decisions in hospital settings. Future research should examine other approaches to integrating ML into hospital clinician decisions related to patient care, and report on PROGRESS-PLUS items.

"Background and objective: To deal with recent issues such as climate change, rural aging, food security, and the Fourth Industrial Revolution, there is a growing interest in smart farms that can efficiently produce food with ICT. In response to the international issues, this study analyzed articles on smart farms published in international journals and KCI journals as well as Instagram hashtags through text mining and identified relevant research trends and public awareness. Methods: This study collected total 584 articles on smart farms from 2010 to 2021 and hashtags in Instagram posts uploaded in 2021. To improve the reliability of the analysis results, nouns were exclusively extracted from the abstracts and hashtags, and data preprocessing was performed by removing nouns that appear customarily and combining synonyms. After that, we analyzed frequency, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and topic modeling. Results: The analysis results of words with high frequency and centrality by research data are as follows. KCI and international journal articles had a tendency to mainly focus on ICT system development for efficient operation of smart farms. However, KCI articles considered relevant policies to establish the technologies. On the other hand, international journal articles tended to conduct research on smart farms in a wider area of agricultural fields than KCI articles. The main topics on Instagram were diet food, rural migration, and urban agriculture. This result shows that healthy food, experiences, and education through smart farms are gaining public interest. Conclusion: Currently, there is insufficient analysis of research trends in smart farms. In this vein, this study has significance as it included academic trends and public awareness by considering both research articles and Instagram posts. We expect the results of this study to be used as useful data for decision making to set the research and policy directions required to advance smart farms in the future. © 2023 by the Society for People, Plants, and Environment."
"Video captioning requires that the model has the abilities of video understanding, video-Text alignment, and text generation. Due to the semantic gap between vision and language, conducting video-Text alignment is a crucial step to reduce the semantic gap, which maps the representations from the visual to the language domain. However, the existing methods often overlook this step, so the decoder has to directly take the visual representations as input, which increases the decoder's workload and limits its ability to generate semantically correct captions. In this paper, we propose a video-Text alignment module with a retrieval unit and an alignment unit to learn video-Text aligned representations for video captioning. Specifically, we firstly propose a retrieval unit to retrieve sentences as additional input which is used as the semantic anchor between visual scene and language description. Then, we employ an alignment unit with the input of the video and retrieved sentences to conduct the video-Text alignment. The representations of two modal inputs are aligned in a shared semantic space. The obtained video-Text aligned representations are used to generate semantically correct captions. Moreover, retrieved sentences provide rich semantic concepts which are helpful for generating distinctive captions. Experiments on two public benchmarks, i.e., VATEX and MSR-VTT, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-The-Art performances by a large margin. The qualitative analysis shows that our method generates correct and distinctive captions.  © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery."
"Machine learning offers a convenient and intelligent tool for a variety of applications in the fields ranging from fundamental research to financial analysis. With the explosive growth of data streams, i.e., ""big data,""optical machine learning with the inherent capacity for massive parallel processing is gradually attracting attention. Despite significant experimental and theoretical progress in this area, limited by the coherent manipulation of multibeams, high dimensional optical vector or matrix operation is still challenging. Here, by using the second harmonic generation of high dimensional orbital angular momentum superposition states, we present a compact and robust optical clustering machine, which is the crucial component in machine learning. In experiment, we conduct supervised clustering for classification of three- and eight-dimensional vectors and unsupervised clustering for text mining of 14-dimensional texts both with high accuracies. The presented optical clustering scheme could offer a pathway for constructing high speed and low energy consumption machine learning architectures.  © 2023 Author(s)."
"The return voyage of the Argonauts described in the Library presents remarkable differences compared to the model provided by Apollonius of Rhodes. Here we focus specifically on two aspects of the trip in Apollodorus’s version, with the aim of providing new insights on these elements of the story that deviate from Apollonius: the order of the stages in the Adriatic Sea and the absence of the Libyan episode. As a result, our analysis allows us to appreciate, beyond the canonical value acquired by Apollonius’s text in the early imperial period, the important role played by other local myths, even glimpsing the influence of more ancient traditions about the journey of the Argonauts. Moreover, Apollodorus’ authorial choices seem to reveal a general scepticism for the part of the mythographer regarding the possibility of adapting the landscape of the mythological traditions to the geographical knowledge of his time. © 2023 Classical Association of the Middle West and South, Inc..

"The research aims to prove the validity of studying the confessional language personality (LP) by domestic written monuments and to identify the representational aspects and means of the Old Believers’ worldview. The research material is original texts of two diaries (1915–1923 and 1956–1975) and personal notes (1940–1980) written by the Old Believers’ community members living in the north of Tomsk Oblast. The total lexical volume of these sources is about 15 thousand word usages. The analysis is based on the sociolinguistic portraiture method, which involves describing linguistic facts reflected in texts of different levels (graphics, vocabulary, grammar, etc.) and the authors’ personal qualities indicating their religious attitudes. We first examine LPs recognized a priori as confessional, then texts in search for information verifying the hypothesis of analysis in them. This analysis is based on Yuri Karaulov’s idea of the three-level LP structure, as well as the experience of describing individual religious LPs presented in linguistic works by Tolstova (2007), Chikovani (2016), Plotnikova (2021). We revealed all the features identifying this confessional community: marginality, insularity, heightened self-consciousness, self-sufficiency, traditionalism, eschatology. These features are related to each other. All of them are manifested textually by different means: special lexical items, grammatical forms, graphics, descriptions of people of one’s circle and their activities in the coordinates of natural time and reclaimed areas, or by a hidden polemic suggesting the reflection of only positive aspects of being in this description. The markers of Old Believers’ LP at the verbal(grammatical)-semantic level are lexical items with a confessional meaning (Isus, Rozhestvo, bratets, otche), a wide variation due to bookish and written linguistic means (noshch’, ezero, glagolit’, desnitsa, sil’nAGO, vtorYY), mastery of the semi-uncial writing norms. The traditional values of the Old Believer world (LP’s cognitive level) manifested in records include the affirmation of the equality of all community members; family-like closeness of like-minded people; the recognition of authorities only in terms of spirituality (otche –godfather); the high significance of labor, books, sacred texts; the realized need for strict adherence to all religious canons (for example, the admissibility of only passive hunting, voluntary assumption of functions of community chroniclers). In our opinion, the tasks of preserving the Old Believers’ sacred space that express the writers’ interests and goals reflected in the records constitute the pragmatic (motivational) level of the confessional LP. Although we revealed the three-level structure mainly on the material of two specific confessional LPs, there are reasons to correlate the identified features with the generalized Old Believer’s LP. © 2023 Tomsk State University.

"The article analyses the feuilleton as a speech genre. The communicative tasks, linguistic embodiment, images of the author and the addressee in the context of studying the forms of interaction between literature and journalism in transitional epochs are investigated. Based on the texts of Shpilka (Vasily Ivanov) and Nadezhda Lukhmanova, the author of the article examines the strategies and tactics of the feuilleton in the newspaper Yuzhny kray for 1900–1905. The term “feuilleton” contains at least two meanings: (1) a heading with artistic and journalistic texts; (2) genre commonality of texts. The determination of the genre by socio-cultural circumstances and the natural revival of the satirical trend for the pre-revolutionary time are substantiated. Among the features uniting the texts, the article notes the concentration on current events, the lightness and liveliness of the style, the combination of artistic and journalistic properties in the texts, the ease and spontaneity of the composition. Social and political issues, as well as the principles of relevance and topicality, began to dominate by 1905. The growth of sociality in the feuilleton can be explained by a number of factors: impact as a fundamental feature of the genre, as well as the format of the newspaper text itself, where an ongoing dialogue with subscribers is conducted, which provides influence and enhances the role of interaction with the interests of readers. One cannot fail to note the factor of time, especially before the revolution, when the polarity in views among members of society increased, and journalism and propaganda strategies were used more, including through newspaper materials. In the space of feuilleton studies, literary and artistic features and journalistic ideas are combined. For Shpilka’s texts, the most appropriate definition would be the following: the feuilleton is an artistic and journalistic genre in which the comic essence of negative phenomena and situations of reality is revealed through the inverse, associative development of a theme using allegory techniques. Lukhmanova’s texts in form and direction gravitate towards the novella. They are characterized by confession, narrative essay, descriptiveness and detail. Thus, when comparing the works of the two feuilletonists, it is more appropriate to speak of the varieties of the feuilleton. The works of both authors lead to the intersection of journalism and literature, which corresponds to the original borderline of the genre. In the space of their feuilleton studies, literary and artistic features and journalistic ideas are combined. © 2023 Tomsk State University. All rights reserved."
"Objective: To explore the abuse and neglect phenomenon in long-term care facilities for the elderly population. Method: The systematic review comprised search on PubMed, CINAHL, MEDLINE and ScienceDirect databases following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The key words used were older people care, long-term care, older people and older adults. Articles published in the last 5 years between 2017 to 2021 in recognised English-language journals and whose full text was available on the websites were included. Details of the selected studies were noted and analysed. Results: Of the 336 studies initially identified, 15(4.46%) were reviewed in detail. Of them, 3(20%) had been done in North America, 6(40%) in Europe and 6(40%) in Asia. The prevalence of abuse and neglect in long-term care facilities for the elderly was generally high, with nursing home staff mostly involved due to burnout syndrome or related to personal factors, such as childhood adversity and work-related stress. Conclusion: Better understanding is critical for improving the quality of care in long-term care facilities to prevent abuse and neglect with the elderly. © 2023 Pakistan Medical Association.

"Problem-based learning (PBL) has been used in different domains, and there is overwhelming evidence of its value. As an emerging field with excellent prospects, learning analytics (LA)—especially multimodal learning analytics (MMLA)—has increasingly attracted the attention of researchers in PBL. However, current research on the integration of LA with PBL has not related LA results with specific PBL steps or paid enough attention to the interaction in peer learning, especially for text data generated from peer interaction. This study employed MMLA based on machine learning (ML) to quantify the process engagement of peer learning, identify log behaviors, self-regulation, and other factors, and then predict online PBL performance. Participants were 104 fourth-year students in an online course on social work and problem-solving. The MMLA model contained multimodal data from online discussions, log files, reports, and questionnaires. ML classification models were built to classify text data in online discussions. The results showed that self-regulation, messages post, message words, and peer learning engagement in representation, solution, and evaluation were predictive of online PBL performance. Hierarchical linear regression analyses indicated stronger predictive validity of the process indicators on online PBL performance than other indicators. This study addressed the scarcity of students’ process data and the inefficiency of analyzing text data, as well as providing information on targeted learning strategies to scaffold students in online PBL.

"Transplant-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA) is an increasingly recognized complication of allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic cellular therapy (HCT), associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although the central drivers of the disease are thought to be endothelial damage and complement activation, no specific diagnostic biomarkers have been identified. TA-TMA is typically diagnosed using criteria comprised of non-specific clinical and laboratory features. Some patients will have a self-remitting course, but more than half develop multi-organ dysfunction or die, making prognostic biomarkers critical. Prevention of TA-TMA, an approach central to other HCT complications such as graft-versus-host disease, is largely untested in part due to a lack of identified early high-risk biomarkers. We conducted a systematic review to summarize the diagnostic, early risk, and prognostic biomarkers of TA-TMA. We screened the titles and abstracts of 1524 citations. After screening out duplications, we read the abstracts of 979 papers and fully reviewed 132 full-text publications. Thirty-one publications fulfilled the inclusion criteria of more than five patients with TA-TMA and a reported measure of association with diagnosis, prognosis, or risk of later development of the disease. Fourteen studies (45%) were with adults, 12 (39%) were with children <18 years old, three included both children and adults, and two did not report age. There were 53 biomarker or biomarker signature entries, and a total of 27 unique biomarkers. Only four biomarkers reported sensitivity and specificity. The single biomarker with the most robust data was sC5b-9, which conferred diagnostic, prognostic, and risk implications. Studies of combinations of biomarkers were rare. No meta-analyses were performed because of significant heterogeneity between studies. The limitations of studies included small sample size, study designs with a high risk of bias (i.e., case–control), the timing of sample collection, and the selection of controls. Furthermore, only two (6%) studies included a training and validation cohort. Cut-off points are needed to stratify groups, as most biomarkers do not have normal values, or normal values cannot be assumed in the HCT setting. In the future, multi-institutional, collaborative efforts are needed to perform rigorously designed, prospective studies with serially enrolled patients, with samples collected at the time of TA-TMA diagnosis, careful selection of controls, and validation of selected biomarkers and cut-off points in a separate cohort.

"Purpose: Intelligent manufacturing has attracted extensive attention from national strategy, academic research and enterprises' practices. The purpose of this study is to investigate the influence of intelligent manufacturing on performance in manufacturing firms. Moreover, how intelligent manufacturing technology affects enterprise performance, this study provided a practice that can be replicated by other businesses. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses text mining to collect the intelligence level of Chinese listed companies. It uses quantitative analysis to test the proposed model based on samples of 2,091 manufacturers. Findings: Intelligent manufacturing has positive effect on short-term performance and long-term performance. Intelligent manufacturing can empower firms with ambidextrous capabilities, including exploit capability and explore capability. Exploit capability has positive effects on short-term performance and long-term performance. Explore capability has negative effects on short-term performance, but has positive effects on long-term performance. Originality/value: On the theoretical side, it enriches the research framework between intelligent manufacturing and enterprise performance. This study explains the preconditions and results of ambidextrous capabilities. Moreover, based on the practice-based view (PBV), this study proposes that technologies can be used as strategies, filling a gap in the existing research on strategic management. On the practical side, how to quantify the intelligent manufacturing level of enterprises provides a certain reference. Also, this study provides an easy to imitate practice that can serve as a model for under-performing enterprises. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"This research aimed to study the role of selective attention, the retention and executive components of working memory, and verbal aptitude in producing explanatory inferences in the comprehension of expository texts. For this purpose, 171 undergraduates completed tests of working memory, selective attention, verbal aptitude, and explanatory inference questionnaires after reading expository texts. The results of the structural equation modeling indicated that the production of explanatory inferences is determined directly by verbal aptitude and the executive component of verbal working memory. The analysis also detected a mediation interaction effect between the abilities to produce explanatory inferences, selective attention span, and the ability to store verbal information in working memory. These components indirectly affected the ability to infer via the executive component of working memory. This suggest that the ability to make explanatory inferences in the comprehension of expository texts is strongly related to verbal aptitude and the capacity to process information in working memory, while the ability to manage selective attention and retain verbal information in short-term memory have an impact on the ability to generate inferences mediated by working memory. © 2023, Fundacion para el Avance de la Psicologia.

"In the original publication [1], the data of aroma components in Table 2 were not complete. Therefore, we decided to make additional improvements, thus giving a more complete picture of the composition and dynamic changes of the floral aroma in the three species of Tilia. This article has been updated at some points as follows: Abstract—The sentence “47 aroma compounds were preliminarily identified, including terpenes, alcohols, ethers, esters, aldehydes, heterocyclics and alkanes” was replaced with “A total of 70 volatile components were detected, 43 aroma compounds were identified”. The content “9 crucial aroma components” was replaced with “14 crucial aroma components”. Results—Subsequent results and points based on data from Table 2 have been updated along with the corresponding figures and tables. Discussion—The sentence “The three species from Tilia were all in the blooming stage when the peak period of fragrance emission as seen by the results” was replaced with “The emissions of major aroma components in the three species of Tilia were basically in the blooming stage as seen by the results”. The content “9 key floral scent components” was replaced with “14 key floral scent components”. Paragraph in Section 2.5 should be corrected as: Excel (Microsoft Office Standard 2019, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, USA) was used to calculate the relative content (%) of each aroma component; UpSet diagrams were performed by using the OmicShare tools, a free online platform for data analysis (https://www.omicshare.com/tools), accessed on 5 June 2022; SPSS Statistics 26.0 software (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for the Kruskal–Wallis non-parametric test; SIMCA 14.1.0.2047 software (Umetrics, Umeå, Sweden) was used for the PLS-DA model, drawing score scatter plot and loading scatter plot, calculation of VIP value and permutation test; Matlab R2021a software (Math Works Corporation, Natick, MA, USA) was used for calculating the aroma similarity rates; aroma characteristics were collected from ‘The Good Scents’ company network database (www.thegoodscentscompany.com), accessed on 5 January 2022.

"Foreign tourism has gained immense popularity in the recent past. To make a rational decision about the destination to be visited one has to go through variety of social media sources with very large number of reviews, which is a tedious task. Automated analysis of these reviews is quite complex as it involves non structured text data having slang terms also. Moreover, these reviews are pouring in continuously. To overcome this problem, this paper provides a Big Data analytics-based framework to make appropriate selection of the destination on the basis of automated analysis of social media contents based upon the adaptation and augmentation of various tools and technologies. The framework has been implemented using Apache Spark and Bidirectional Encoder Representation Transformers (BERT) deep learning models through which raw text review are analysed and a final score based on five metrics is obtained to recommend destination for visit. © 2023 International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication.

"Objective To compare the perioperative outcomes and safety of percutaneous nephrostomy (PCN) and retrograde ureteral stenting (RUS) in the treatment of acute obstructive upper urinary tract infection. Methods A comprehensive search was performed on the MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify relevant literatures. The retrieval period was from the establishment of the database to August 2022. Inclusion criteria: ①Randomized controlled trial (RCT) of PCN and RUS in the treatment of acute obstructive upper urinary tract infection; ②Studies provided accurate data for analysis, including the total number of subjects and the results of each index; ③The full text of the study was available, and different literatures published in the same cohort were included in the newly published data. ④The observation indexes included the time for the recovery of body temperature, creatinine, leukocyte, operation, radiation exposure, postoperative fever, postoperative pain, and the incidence of postoperative fistulotomy or stent displacement. Exclusion criteria: ①non-RCT study; ②unable to obtain the full text. Two researchers independently screened the literature and evaluated the literature quality, and all the statistical data were analyzed by RevMan5.3 software. Results Seven trials enrolled 727 patients were included in the meta-analysis, 412 in the PCN group and 315 in the RUS group included. Meta-analysis revealed that the advantages of PCN were lower incidence of postoperative hematuria (OR=0.54, 95%CI 0.30-0.99, P=0.040) and lower incidence of insertion failure (OR=0.42, 95%CI 0.21-0.81, P=0.010), but the fluoroscopy time of RUS group was shorter than that of PCN group (MD=0.31, 95%CI 0.14-0.48, P<0.01). Moreover, there was no significant difference in time to normalization of temperature, time to normalization of creatinine, time to normalization of WBC, operative time, postoperative fever, postoperative pain, postoperative nephrostomy tube or stent slippage rate between the two surgical methods(P>0.05). Conclusions The radiation exposure time of PCN was longer than that of RUS, but the incidence of postoperative hematuria and catheterization failure was lower than that of RUS. © 2023 Chinese Journal of Urology.

"When a digital collection has been processed by OCR, the usability expecta-tions of patrons and researchers are high. While the former expect full text search to return all instances of terms in historical collections correctly, the lat-ter are more familiar with the impacts of OCR errors but would still like to apply big data analysis or machine-learning methods. All of these use cases depend on high quality textual transcriptions of the scans. This is why the National Library of Luxembourg (BnL) has developed a pipeline to improve OCR for existing digitised documents. Enhancing OCR in a digital library not only demands improved machine learning models, but also requires a coherent reprocessing strategy in order to apply them efficiently in production systems. The newly developed software tool, Nautilus, fulfils these requirements using METS/ALTO as a pivot format. The BnL has open-sourced it so that other libraries can re-use it on their own collections. This paper covers the creation of the ground truth, the details of the reprocessing pipeline, its production use on the entirety of the BnL collection, along with the estimated results. Based on a quality prediction measure, developed during the project, approximately 28 million additional text lines now exceed the quality threshold. © 2023, Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services.

"Introduction The production of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) has grown in the past years. Notwithstanding, the quality of these documents and their recommendations for the treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents is still unknown. Objective To assess the quality of the guidelines and recommendations for the treatment of schizophrenia in this population. Methods CPGs from 2004 to December 2020 were identified through a systematic search on EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Epistemonikos, VHL, Global Index Medicus and specific CPG databases. The CPGs' quality was independently assessed by three reviewers using AGREE II and they were considered of high quality if they scored ≥60% in domains 3 and 6. The evidence classification systems were described, the quality of recommendations was assessed in pairs using AGREE-REX and the recommendations were compared. Results The database search retrieved 3182 results; 2030 were screened and 29 were selected for full-text reading. Four guidelines were selected for extraction. Two CPGs were considered of high quality in the AGREE II assessment. We described the commonly agreed recommendations for each treatment phase. The pharmacological recommendations were described in all treatment phases. Scores of AGREE-REX were lower for psychosocial recommendations. Conclusion There are still few clinical studies and CPGs regarding schizophrenia in children and adolescents. The quality of the documents was overall low, and the quality of the recommendations report has much to improve. There is also a lack of transparency about the quality of the evidence and the strength of the recommendations. Protocol registration number CRD42020164899. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

"Sentiment analysis is a vital area of current research. The area of sentiment analysis is extensively used for observing text data and identifying the sentiment element. Every day, e- commerce sites produce a massive amount of text information from customer's comments, reviews, tweets, and feedbacks. One of the most recent technological advances in web development is the emergence of social networking websites. It aids in communication and knowledge gathering. Aspect - based evaluation of this information can help businesses to gain a greater understanding of their consumers' expectations and then shape their plans accordingly. It is difficult to convey the exact sentiment of a review. In this study, we demonstrated an approach that focuses on sentimental aspects of the item's characteristics. Consumer reviews on Amazon and IMDB have been presented and evaluated. We obtained the dataset from the UCI repository, where each analysis's opinion rates are first observed. To get meaningful information from datasets, and to eliminate noise, the pre-processing operations are performed by the system such as tokenization, punctuation, whitespace, special character, and stop-word removal. For the purpose of accurately representing the preprocessed data, feature selection methods such as word frequency-inverse document frequency are utilized (TF–IDF). The customer reviews from three datasets Amazon, Yelp, and IMDB is merged and classification is performed using classifiers such as Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In last, we provide some insight into the future text classification work. © 2023 Lavoisier. All rights reserved."
"[Purpose/Significance] We used to process soybean leaf data by looking at them and process data manually, but this method is very inefficient. In order to improve the classification accuracy and efficiency of soybean leaf images, further for storage and management of these images, we used the deep learning technique to make an in-depth study of text data and image data of soybean leaves for the image recognition and classification. The application of deep learning in agricultural data management mainly focuses on the image recognition and classification of plants and plant phenotypes in large-scale data, detection and classification of agricultural diseases and pests, detection and classification of crops and weeds, and prediction of crop yield. Through case analysis, our sample data demonstrated the application process of deep learning technology. [Method/Process] This paper systematically described the whole process of classification and recognition of agricultural data by using the deep learning technique. Through recognition and disease monitoring of plant leaves, the leaf morphology of soybean plants in the soybean experimental field of Heilongjiang Academy of Agricultural Sciences was taken as an example. We analyzed the image features of soybean leaf morphology, and carried out the classification and recognition research of soybean leaf morphology based on deep learning. Deep learning techniques have replaced shallow classifiers that use manual feature training and can identify soybean leaves with a high degree of accuracy as long as sufficient data are available for training. We adopted DenseNet model, which is suitable for common network model. The advantages of this model are that it has the best performance and the least storage requirements. First袁 we selected support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) in traditional machine learning methods to identify soybean leaf morphology. Second, AlexNet and ResNet were selected to identify soybean leaf morphology. Finally, the recognition accuracy of different methods were compared with the DenseNet network adopted in this paper. [Results/Conclusions] Through the training of DenseNet model, the recognition accuracy of 94% was achieved, which successfully solved the problems of long time, low efficiency and low recognition accuracy of traditional methods in processing image classification of soybean leaves, and could meet the actual needs of agricultural image data classification. Future research efforts will strive to collect a wide range of large and diverse data sets to facilitate soybean leaf recognition, and focus on developing reliable background removal techniques and incorporating other forms of data to improve the accuracy and reliability of soybean leaf recognition systems. © Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

"Objective: Based on experiences following the Great East Japan Earthquake and nuclear power plant accident in 2011, Nuclear Emergency Core Hospitals (NECHs) were designated as centers for radiation disaster management in Japan. This study aimed to investigate their current status and identify areas for improvement. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in October 2018. Demographic data were collected by a questionnaire with free text responses about attitudes toward NECHs. Considerations regarding risk communications during a radiation disaster were analyzed using qualitative text mining analysis. Results: A total of 36 hospitals participated in this study. Only 31% of NECHs anticipated a radiation disaster. The importance of business continuity plans and risk communications was shown. Text analysis identified 7 important categories for health care workers during a radiation disaster, including media response, communications to hospital staff, risk communications, radiation effects on children, planning for a radiation disaster in the region, rumors, and the role in the region. Conclusion: The radiation disaster medical system and NECHs in Japan were surveyed. The importance of risk communications, planning for a radiation disaster in each region, and the role in the region are identified as issues that need to be addressed.  © The Author(s), 2022.

"Introduction: Teachers’ self-efficacy is an important indicator of student teachers’ preparedness for teaching. Interventions using video lessons are effective in increasing student teachers’ self-efficacy. However, there is a lack of research on emotional and reflective processes in the context of video-based interventions. Methods: The present study examined emotions and reflection as well as their effects on changes in self-efficacy in a video-based intervention. A total of 159 student teachers participated in the study. The participants were randomly assigned to three groups: Two groups analyzed video lessons in which group roup one received open-ended observation tasks (ig1) and group two received structured observation tasks (ig2). Participants in the control group (cg) analyzed text-based case studies with open-ended observation tasks. Results: The results show that self-efficacy increased with medium effect size (d = 0.68) in video group two (ig2), whose members analyzed videos using structured observation tasks but not in video group one (ig1), whose members analyzed open-ended observation tasks, and in the control group. In addition, there were significant relations between positive arousal and reflection. Finally, regression analyses showed that reflection was a significant predictor for changes in self-efficacy, whereas no significant effect of emotional arousal was detected. Discussion: In conclusion, the findings of this study indicate that video-based interventions with structured observation tasks increased self-efficacy among student teachers. Furthermore, the findings provide novel evidence on the association between reflection, self-efficacy and emotion in video-based interventions in teacher education.

"Topic modeling is the task of identifying topics in a corpus of documents. This is useful for search engines, customer service automation, and any other situation where document topics are important to know. There are numerous studies conducted about this field. Given the importance of topic modeling in various areas, this survey paper, explore some articles related to topic modeling (between 2013 to 2020) based on multiple methods such as: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and Non Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), on different social media sources such as (Amazon, Reddit, and Yelp). LDA and NMF general concepts are presented, in addition to the challenges of topic modeling and methods of evaluation. This paper does not go deep into the details of each of these methods. It only describes the high-level view that related to topic modeling in text mining. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved."
"Introduction Women with breast cancer who do not adhere to adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) have increased risks of mortality and recurrence. There are multiple barriers to AET adherence, including medication side-effects, beliefs about medication, memory and psychological distress. We developed four intervention components, each targeting a different barrier. This pilot trial is part of the preparation phase of the Multiphase Optimisation Strategy, and aims to establish key trial parameters, establish intervention component adherence, establish availability and feasibility of outcome and process data, estimate variability in planned outcome measures and estimate cost of developing and delivering each intervention component. Methods and analysis The four intervention components are as follows: short message service text reminders (target: memory); a written information leaflet (target: medication beliefs); a guided self-help Acceptance and Commitment Therapy programme (target: psychological flexibility to reduce distress) and a self-management website (target: side-effect management). To evaluate the feasibility of recruitment, acceptability of the intervention components and the availability of outcome data, we will conduct a multisite, exploratory pilot trial using a 2 4-1 fractional factorial design, with a nested process evaluation. We will randomise 80 women with early-stage breast cancer who have been prescribed AET to one of eight experimental conditions. This will determine the combination of intervention components they receive, ranging from zero to four, with all conditions receiving usual care. Key outcomes of interest include medication adherence and quality of life. Progression to the optimisation phase will be based on predefined criteria for consent rates, patient adherence to intervention components and availability of medication adherence data. Ethics and dissemination The study was reviewed by the Wales Research Authority Research Ethics Committee 3 (21/WA/0322). Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients before randomisation. The results of this trial will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed journal.

The text-based person search task aims at retrieving images of target pedestrians in a large-scale database with text as a query，which is highly practical in social and public safety. In contrast with the conventional crossmodal retrieval task，all categories in this task are pedestrians. However，the slight appearance difference among different pedestrians makes it difficult to discriminate，and poor shooting conditions cause the production of bad image quality. Therefore，the effective extraction of robust and discriminative visual features is an important challenge to this task. In response，a text-based person search algorithm based on self-supervised learning was designed，which formulated the self-supervised learning and text-based person search task in the form of multitask learning. Both tasks were trained at the same time and shared similar model parameters. As an auxiliary task，the self-supervised task aims to learn more robust and discriminative visual features for the person search task. Specifically，visual and textual features were first extracted，and the image inpainting was applied as a self-supervised task，aiming to learn richer semantic information and become more robust to occlusion data. Based on the particularity of the person image，a mirror flip prediction task was further designed to learn discriminative details by training the network to predict whether the image was mirror-flipped or not. This was applied to enable the person search task to distinguish difficult samples. Extensive experiments on the public dataset have demonstrated the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed approach，thereby improving the Top-1 accuracy of person search by 2.77%. Experimental results also show that the two self-supervised tasks are complementary，and better retrieval performance can be achieved using them at the same time. © 2023 Tianjin University.

"Text classification is the method of allocating a particular piece of text to one or more of a number of predetermined categories or labels. This is done by training a machine learning model on a labeled dataset, where the texts and their corresponding labels are provided. The model then learns to predict the labels of new, unseen texts. Feature selection is a significant step in text classification as it helps to identify the most relevant features or words in the text that are useful for predicting the label. This can include things like specific keywords or phrases, or even the frequency or placement of certain words in the text. The performance of the model can be improved by focusing on the features that are most important to the information that is most likely to be useful for classification. Additionally, feature selection can also help to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, making the model more efficient and easier to interpret. A method for extracting aspect terms from product reviews is presented in the research paper. This method makes use of the Gini index, information gain, and feature selection in conjunction with the Machine learning classifiers. In the proposed method, which is referred to as wRMR, the Gini index and information gain are utilized for feature selection. Following that, machine learning classifiers are utilized in order to extract aspect terms from product reviews. A set of customer testimonials is used to assess how well the projected method works, and the findings indicate that in terms of the extraction of aspect terms, the method that has been proposed is superior to the method that has been traditionally used. In addition, the recommended approach is contrasted with methods that are currently thought of as being state-of-the-art, and the comparison reveals that the proposed method achieves superior performance compared to the other methods. In general, the method that was presented provides a promising solution for the extraction of aspect terms, and it can also be utilized for other natural language processing tasks. © 2023 International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication.

"Purpose: The impact of a mixture of positive and negative media coverage on long-run hotel survival remains unknown. This paper aims to investigate how the mixed positive and negative media coverage, namely, inconsistent media coverage, influences long-run hotel survival. Design/methodology/approach: A yearly panel data set covering 792 news-reported hotels in Guangdong province of China, over the period 2010–2020, is analyzed using an inconsistency analysis framework consisting of text mining and survival analysis. The estimates of exponential models on the same observations and Cox estimates on alternative observations are used for robustness checks. Findings: The inconsistency calculation method proposed here can measure the controversy degree well. There exists a U-shaped relationship between inconsistency of media coverage and hotel longevity, and hotel survival is significantly reduced only when the degree of inconsistency is within the range of 17.8%–53.6%. The U-shaped relationship is moderated by negative hotel image and by online media coverage on hotel operation strategy topics. Practical implications: This study provides suggestions for hotel managers to use media coverage inconsistency to increase long-run hotel survival in the digital era. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is one of the first to investigate long-run hotel survival factors from the perspective of media coverage inconsistency. It also proposes a method to calculate the degree of media coverage controversy, which helps to quantify the relationship between the degree of inconsistency and hotel survival. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The aim of the article is to analyze the symbolism of clouds in the idiostyle of Sergey Yesenin. The object of the analysis is the “atmospheric phenomena” symbolism within the semantic field of “nature”. The focus of the research is the specificity of the symbolism of clouds in the linguistic image of the poet’s world. The research methods of semantic analysis and linguistic description are used. The material for the analysis is fragments of poetic texts by Sergey Yesenin. An attempt is made to describe the mechanism of creating a symbolic sense, which is also a metaphorical sense and is based on associative, analogous thinking. The factual material illustrates the role of the semantic phenomenon of the contextual connotation of words (lexemes) in a poetic text. The article shows that the symbolism of clouds in Yesenin reflects certain phenomena, e.g., things (beard, lace), atmospheric phenomena (rain), place (cornfield), physical phenomena (chill), animals (horse), perception of the world (unhappiness, illusion, mystery), people (believers). The attention was paid to the exceptional transparency of the phenomenon of things (honey, smoke, threshold, blade, beard, lace, lake, torn clothing (outfit)), which create the so-called functional metaphor. The conducted analysis will contribute to the enrichment of knowledge on the creation of a model of mechanisms controlling symbolic-metaphorical (figurative) thinking, as well as to further studies on the functioning mechanism of associative (metaphorical) thinking. A possibility of comparative analysis of clouds symbolism in the idiostyles of other Russian or European poets is suggested. © 2023 Tomsk State University. All rights reserved."
"The article interprets the mystery codes in the poem “Field Hospital” by Arseny Tarkovsky. The research is based on the principles of mythopoetic and structural-semantic analysis of the text, and provides a systematic approach to the work, taking into account the specifics of its plot-genre paradigmatics and figurative-symbolic language. The inner world of the poem is organized by the logic of the mystery topos with its key coordinates: frontier ontology; the evolving character of time and the reflection of its dynamics in the “dialectic of the soul”; existential self-reflection and detachment of the hero’s consciousness. The motivic complex of the border, repeatedly manifested in the text and culminating in the symbolism of the limb, becomes a meta-image, in the semantic field of which all the named parameters of the mystery continuum intersect. The model of reality recreated in Tarkovsky’s poem goes beyond mythological monism, but it clearly correlates with the mystery organization of the chronotope: the mystic is aware of the multidimensionality of the universe and the existence of boundaries between different spheres of reality – primarily profane-everyday and sacred – as well as the possibility of moving across these boundaries, which, ultimately, is one of the results of mystery initiations. The plot-forming meaning in “Field Hospital” is acquired by allusive references to the mystery texts of culture: the ancient Egyptian, Christian, alchemical mysteries are dialogically integrated in the act of birth – transfiguration – resurrection experienced by Tarkovsky’s hero. The central place in this paradigm is given to the mystery of Osiris and Isis, the symbolic codes of which are reflected in a number of iconic motifs, images, and details. The key among them are the motif of dismemberment and the semantic complex of the victim associated with it; the symbolism of death – resurrection; the archetypal dyad of a newborn – infant; a tree-natural code associated with the lyrical hero; the allusively designated image of Isis, personifying the female harmonizing principle of the universe. If the motif of dismemberment contains a specific reference to the theme of Osiris, then the other elements in this series also relate to the mystery of Christ and, accordingly, to the texts of culture associated with it, including the mysteries of the alchemists. The study leads to the conclusion that Tarkovsky’s “Field Hospital” is read as a metatext, where in a situation of semantic dialogue different culturological modes of mystery coexist, and the mystery consciousness itself enters into a relationship of mutual reflection with the mythological and tragic worldview. The logic of the myth is intertwined in the development of the lyrical plot with the logic of tragedy, which in turn is overcome through a detached view of the tragic situations experienced and the mystery-conscious acceptance of fate and life in all their manifestations. © 2023 Tomsk State University.

"Background: Personalized medicine (PM) is now the new frontier in patient care. The application of this new paradigm extends to various pathologies and different patient care phases, such as diagnosis and treatment. Translating biotechnological advances to clinical routine means adapting health services at all levels is necessary. Purpose: This article aims to identify the elements for devising a framework that will allow the level of PM implementation in the country under study to be quantitatively and qualitatively assessed and that can be used as a guideline for future implementation plans. Methods: A systematic review was conducted per the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. The research question was: What are the domains for determining the level of implementation of PM at the national level? The domains for assessing the degree of PM implementation, which would form the framework, were established. Results: 19 full-text studies that met the inclusion criteria were peer-selected in the systematic review. From all the studies that were included, 37 elements—encompassed in 11 domains—were extracted for determining the degree of PM implementation. These domains and their constituent elements comprise the qualitative and quantitative assessment framework presented herein. Each of the elements can be assessed individually. On the other hand, the domains were standardized to all have the same weight in an overall assessment. Conclusions: A framework has been developed that takes a multi-factorial approach to determine the degree of implementation of PM at the national level. This framework could also be used to rank countries and their implementation strategies according to the score they receive in the application of the latter. It could also be used as a guide for developing future national PM implementation strategies.

"As a powerful text generation model, the Variational AutoEncoder(VAE) has attracted more and more attention. However, in the process of optimization, the variational auto-encoder tends to ignore the potential variables and degenerates into an auto-encoder, called a posteriori collapse. A new variational autoencoder model is proposed in this paper, called Hierarchical Status Regularisation Variational AutoEncoder (HSR-VAE), which can effectively alleviate the problem of posterior collapse through hierarchical coding and state regularization and has better model performance than the baseline model. On this basis, based on the nanometer memristor, the model is combined with the memristor Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A hardware implementation scheme based on a memristor recurrent neural network is proposed to realize the hardware acceleration of the model, which called Hierarchical Variational AutoEncoder Memristor Neural Networks (HVAE-MHN). Computer simulation experiments and result analysis verify the validity and superiority of the proposed model. © 2023 Science Press. All rights reserved."
"Abstract: An increase in the activity of free radical oxidation is considered as a nonspecific process characteristic of the pathogenesis of various diseases accompanied by antioxidant deficiency. Being bioregulators capable of increasing protective forces, antioxidants are important links in a multistage system of regulation and coordination of various body functions. The structure and function of enzymes involved in the regulation of oxidative stress can be significantly affected by genetic polymorphisms. To date, the role of genes encoding the activity of enzymes of the antioxidant system in the pathogenesis of many diseases remains unexplored, which is of great interest to researchers from various fields. The article presents an overview and analysis of the data of modern scientific literature on the study of the role of antioxidant defense components in the regulation of metabolic processes, their genetic determinants, and generalized data on modern methods for the determination of some antioxidants. While writing the review, the database of the scientific electronic library eLibrary was used, with the keywords being “oxidative stress,” “free radical oxidation,” “antioxidant protection,” “antioxidants,” “antioxidant enzymes,” “enzyme genes,” “antioxidant-responsive element,” and “research methods”; the filters were years of publication of 2012–2022, publications with full text, and publications available for viewing, as well as an English-language database of medical and biological publications created by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), with the keywords “free radical oxidation,” “antioxidant protection,” “antioxidants,” “antioxidant enzymes,” “enzyme genes,” “oxidative stress,” “metabolism,” and “methods.”. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd."
"[Objective] This paper tries to enrich the event logic of traditional fine-grained sentiment analysis from the perspective of emotion-triggering events.[Methods] We analyzed the OCC model’s sentiment generation rules and conditions to create the <event, sentiment> binary groups using event extraction and text classification methods.[Results] The proposed model constructed rules for emotion generation and built a theoretical basis for classifying sentiments. The model effectively identified emotion-triggering events (F1=0.933 8) and sentiments (F1=0.963 7). It generated <event, sentiment> binary groups (F1=0.889 2) to realize event-level fine-grained sentiment analysis. [Limitations] The structure of sentiment generation rules is simple and cannot reflect the diversity of netizens’emotions. The corpus built at present has domain limitations and each corpus only contains one type of emotion-triggering event.[Conclusions] By associating event evaluations and emotions with the help of the OCC model, our new model becomes more in line with human thinking. The model has good interpretability and transferability, which enhances the granularity level of emotional objects in existing studies. It provides new ideas for research in the field of textual sentiment analysis. © 2023, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."
"Objective: To explain the factors related to the implementation of antenatal care in developing countries. Methods: The systematic review was conducted in June 2020 and comprised literature search on Scopus, Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PubMed and Garba Rujukan Digital databases for cross-sectional, survey-based, prospective, mixed-method, correlational, experimental, longitudinal, cohort and case-control studies published after 2015 in either English or Indonesian. The studies included involved pregnant women and discussed the factors of implementing antenatal care in developing countries, and explained the factors related to the implementation of antenatal care in accordance with the World Health Organisation recommendation. The Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes and Study framework was used, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were followed. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics with a narrative approach. Results: Of the 9,733 studies initially found, 50(0.005%) were shortlisted for full-text review, and, of them, 15(30%) were reviewed and analysed. There were 3(20%) each from Pakistan and Ghana, 2(13.3%) each from Nepal and India, and 1(6.66%) each from Jordan, Egypt, Yemen, South Africa and Vietnam. Overall, 10(66.6%) were cross-sectional studies. There were five factors identified regarding antenatal care; behaviour intention, social support, accessibility of information, personal autonomy, and action situations, including economic status, availability of facility and transportation. Conclusion: Antenatal care in pregnant women in developing countries is influenced by several factors, and economic status and the availability of facilities and infrastructure optimise the use of such services. © 2023 Pakistan Medical Association.

"TypeNet is a Siamese network model based on two-layer Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) branch structure. It has achieved good results in the classification of free-text keystroke event sequences, but lacks interpretation. Therefore, the TypeNet model is transformed, and a Siamese network TypeNet II based on a single-layer LSTM branch structure is proposed. A multi-layer perceptron is used to measure the similarity of two feature sequences reflected by the absolute value of the difference between the output embeddings of the two branches. After the model training, the multi-layer perceptron is simulated by a multivariate binomial expression. Based on the obtained multivariate binomial expression, the classification judgment of the model can be explained. The experimental results show that the classification effect of the TypeNet II model exceeds the existing TypeNet model. The results of multivariate binomial regression are generalized, and there is a nonlinear relationship between the absolute value of the difference of the embeddings and the similarity measure. © 2023 Science Press.

"This article examines the relationship between the script and the literary language of British Library, MS Cotton Nero A.x., particularly Pearl, Cleanness, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, arguing that the manuscript's penmanship, little studied, offers an interpretation of its poems. It begins with an extended analysis of and reflection on the script itself, identified as a form of textualis. The script is then connected to the aesthetic ideals of the texts through the language of Cleanness, in a scene adapted from the Book of Daniel that describes God's 'writing on the wall' as 'tied letters'. This representation of an inscriptional process internal to the poem reflects on the visual effect of the manuscript's own textualis. By tracking other instances where 'tied' and its synonyms are used to describe embellishment in Pearl and Gawain as well as Cleanness, the article opens up a broader analysis of the poetic themes in Cotton Nero, bringing an ideal of calligraphic inscription into a constellation of rich material metaphors for divine transcendence. By connecting Cotton Nero's script to the ideals of its poetry, this article ultimately argues that the script is fully unified with the poetry in a common aesthetics that sees material writing as a ready vehicle for immaterial elevation.  © 2022 The Author(s).

"Introduction Opioid prescribing rates are disproportionately high in the North of England. In addition to patients' complex health needs, clinician prescribing behaviour is also a key driver. Although strategies have been initiated to reduce opioid prescribing nationally, the COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted service provision and created challenges for the system and health professionals to tackle this complex issue. A pilot intervention using smartphone video messaging has been developed to remotely explain the rationale for opioid reduction and facilitate self-initiation of support. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential benefits, risks and economic consequences of € at scale' implementation. Methods and analysis This will be a mixed-methods study comprising a quasi-experimental non-randomised before-and-after study and qualitative interviews. The intervention arm will comprise 50 General Practitioner (GP) Practices using System 1 (a clinical computer system hosting the intervention) who will deliver the video to their patients via text message. The control arm will comprise 50 practices using EMIS (a different computer system) who will continue usual care. Monthly practice level prescribing and consultation data will be observed for 6 months postintervention. A general linear model will be used to estimate the association between the exposure and the main outcome (opioid prescribing; average daily quantity (ADQ)/1000 specific therapeutic group age-sex related prescribing unit). Semi-structured interviews will be undertaken remotely with purposively selected participants including patients who received the video, and health professionals involved in sending out the videos and providing additional support. Interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval has been granted by the NHS Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee (22/PR/0296). Findings will be disseminated to the participating sites, participants, and commissioners, and in peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences.

"In 2017, guidelines were published for reporting structural modelling of small-Angle scattering (SAS) data from biomolecules in solution that exemplified best-practice documentation of experiments and analysis. Since then, there has been significant progress in SAS data and model archiving, and the IUCr journal editors announced that the IUCr biology journals will require the deposition of SAS data used in biomolecular structure solution into a public archive, as well as adherence to the 2017 reporting guidelines. In this context, the reporting template tables accompanying the 2017 publication guidelines have been reviewed with a focus on making them both easier to use and more general. With input from the SAS community via the IUCr Commission on SAS and attendees of the triennial 2022 SAS meeting (SAS2022, Campinas, Brazil), an updated reporting template table has been developed that includes standard descriptions for proteins, glycosylated proteins, DNA and RNA, with some reorganization of the data to improve readability and interpretation. In addition, a specialized template has been developed for reporting SAS contrast-variation (SAS-cv) data and models that incorporates the additional reporting requirements from the 2017 guidelines for these more complicated experiments. To demonstrate their utility, examples of reporting with these new templates are provided for a SAS study of a DNA-protein complex and a SAS-cv experiment on a protein complex. The examples demonstrate how the tabulated information promotes transparent reporting that, in combination with the recommended figures and additional information best presented in the main text, enables the reader of the work to readily draw their own conclusions regarding the quality of the data and the validity of the models presented. © 2023 International Union of Crystallography.

"This text presents a brief synthesis of the most important problems associated with the application of private law in the public sector which have arisen in the last 200 years in the states of Continental Europe. In the author's view, the application of private law in the public sector is one of the key issues tackled by legal theorists in the EU Member States. At the same time, this issue is not limited to private-law relations involving public entities. In the last 200 years, the institutions and principles of civil law have also served as the building blocks for the development of public (administrative) law. The analysis of the application of private law in the public sector can be very inspiring and fruitful. Such investigations help in unravelling the issues indicated in the subheadings of this text. Among other things, they brings us closer to grasping the essence of the public-private law division. The place of private law in the whole legal system can thus be defined more precisely. This analysis also provides methodological grounds for developing the concept of the constitutionalization of private law, including its most spectacular manifestation, namely the horizontal application of the constitution. In the author's opinion, the analysis of the application of private law in the public sector also confirms the efficacy of the functional method, which, while being one of the oldest methods employed in comparative law, still prevails in this field. This method is grounded in the conviction that similar or even identical problems occur in different countries. This is especially true of countries which are closely related in terms of their legal systems - such as the EU Member States. Consequently, the measures applied in one legal system to address certain problems are the functional equivalent of the solutions applied in other legal systems. Of course, these equivalents or counterparts may have varying degrees of effectiveness. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Purpose: The role of industry 4.0 (I4.0) technologies for organizations to achieve a competitive advantage and mitigate disruptive emergency situations are well exhibited in literature. However, more light needs to be thrown into implementing I4.0 technologies to digitally transform organizations. This paper introduces a novel framework for formulating manufacturing strategy 4.0 (MS 4.0) that guides organizations to implement I4.0 successfully. Design/methodology/approach: The experts working in I4.0 and technology management domains were interviewed to determine the definition, role and process for formulating MS 4.0. Text mining using VOSViewer© is performed on the experts' opinions to determine the key terms from the opinions through keyword analysis. The identified key terms are mapped together using the existing traditional manufacturing strategy formulation framework to develop the MS 4.0 framework. Finally, the proposed MS 4.0 framework is validated through a triangulation approach. Findings: This study captured the role, definition and process to formulate MS 4.0 and proposed a framework to help practitioners implement I4.0 at manufacturing organizations to achieve competitiveness during normal and emergency situations. Research limitations/implications: The proposed MS 4.0 framework can assist industry practitioners in formulating the strategy for implementing the I4.0 technology/gies to digitally transform their manufacturing firm to retain the maximum manufacturing output and become market competent in normal and emergency situations. Originality/value: This study is the first of its kind in the body of knowledge to formulate a digital transformation strategy, i.e. MS 4.0, to implement I4.0 technologies through a manufacturing strategic lens. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"In the ""Introduction,"" Ralf Rogowski provides biographical information and an overview of the development of Luhmann's social systems theory. In ""Luhmann and Constitutional Sociology: Law and Functional Differentiation Revisited,"" Chris Thornhill analyses how Luhmann's theory of functional differentiation can be used as a methodological device to examine the construction of an institutional and legal framework for governance in the world society. In ""Far from Equilibrium. Niklas Luhmann on Politics and Economy in 21st Century's World Society,"" Aldo Mascareño argues that the political and economic systems have intensified their unpredictable dynamics, hence increasing their levels of instability, as shown by critical events such as the 2008 financial crisis, the 2011 political upheavals, and the 2020 COVID-19 global pandemic. In ""Luhmann on Law and Legal Theory,"" Richard Nobles and David Schiff explain how legal argumentation yields sufficient redundancy and variety in the legal system to achieve the recursive reproduction of legal communications which gives the system opportunities to evolve autopoietically. In ""Epistemic Sociology: Luhmann's Theory of Science and Knowledge,"" Gert Verschraegen underscores the connection of science in society with other function systems such as the educational (coupled via curricula content in textbooks), the economy (coupled via patents), politics (coupled through research policy as well as policy advice), and the medical system (coupled through scientifically tested medicinal knowledge and operation practices). In ""Luhmann's Theory of Art,"" Paul Buckermann examines how Luhmann's functional method is key to understanding art and makes visible possibilities of order that otherwise remain invisible. In ""Luhmann on Religion and Secularization,"" Raf Vanderstraeten discusses, with reference to a host of examples, how the religious system contributed to the genesis of modern society, and how it was forced to adapt to the consequences of modern society's functional differentiation. In ""Niklas Luhmann and Critical Systems Theory,"" Kolja Möller and Jasmin Siri outline features of a critical systems theory and its potential for a critique of modern society. In ""Niklas Luhmann and His Sceptical Notion of Culture,"" Dirk Baecker outlines Luhmann's reserved attitude towards the concept of culture. In ""Luhmann, on Algorithms, in 1966,"" Elena Esposito analyses an early text of Luhmann on Law and Automation in Public Administration. In ""Niklas Luhmann Observed from a Luhmannian Perspective,"" Klaus Dammann analyses Luhmann's biography using Luhmannian concepts and in ""Three Encounters with Niklas Luhmann,"" Gunther Teubner narrates his academic and personal experiences with Luhmann. © 2023 Ralf Rogowski editorial matter and selection.

"The importance of media-induced tourism has increased in the latest decade. The integration and collaboration of film elements is an especially effective pathway for the innovative development and upgrading of the experience of the cultural tourism industry. Existing studies on the mechanism of tourism destinations and cultural tourism development, mainly from the perspective of tourism destinations and tourist experience, have rarely explored the cultural tourism development mechanism from the perspective of interest-related community interaction in the film-enabling context. In this study, we conducted high-frequency word analysis and element category analysis of the online text data of the Japanese animation film Your Name from the angle of interest-related community interaction through utilizing online text analysis and Grounded Theory analysis. Based on the interest-related community interaction, we analyzed the elements of interest-related community interaction in cultural tourism triggered by the film, including tourist hotspots, tourism resources, the tourist experience, sightseeing expectations, tourism evaluation and information dissemination, and formulated the orientation pathway of film-enabling cultural tourism. In this study, we aimed to enrich cultural tourism research and provide a reference point and theoretical support for film-enabling cultural tourism in the Internet era by introducing the concept of interest-related community innovation to the scene of film-enabling cultural tourism.

"Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the principal cause of acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) among infants worldwide, and an important cause of morbidity, hospitalisation and mortality. While infants are universally exposed to RSV, most mortality occurs among normal term infants from low-income and middle-income countries. Breastfeeding has been suggested to have a protective effect against RSV infection. This study aims to determine the association of breastfeeding on the frequency and severity of RSV-associated ALRI among infants. Methods A systematic review was conducted using keywords and Medical Subject Headings on MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, MedRxiv and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Full-text articles published in English from 2000 to 2021 that studied exclusively or partially breastfed infants who developed RSV-associated ALRI <12 months of age were included. Covidence software-based evidence extraction and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocol guidelines were followed. Quality of evidence was analysed using UK National Service Framework grading and the risk-of-bias assessment using Robvis. Results Among 1368 studies screened, 217 qualified full-text review and 198 were excluded based on pre-agreed criteria. Nineteen articles published from 12 countries that included 16 787 infants from 31 countries (of which 8 middle-income) were retained for analysis. Results indicate that non-breastfeeding practices pose a significant risk for severe RSV-associated ALRI and hospitalisation. Exclusive breastfeeding for >4-6 months significantly lowered hospitalisation, length of stay, supplemental oxygen demand and admission to intensive care units. Conclusion In the context of no effective or standardised treatment for established RSV-associated ALRI, available evidence suggest that breastfeeding is associated with lower frequency and severity of RSV-associated ALRI, based on observational studies of variable grades of evidence and risk-of-bias. With both exclusive and partial breastfeeding benefiting infants who develop RSV-associated ALRI, breastfeeding should be promoted globally as an adjunct primary prevention; in addition to emerging immunoprophylaxis and maternal immunisation strategies. © 2023 Author(s)."
"This paper studies the development of the movement and the meaning of hijrah in social media. Hijrah was originally understood as a process of leaving the past misguidance (jahiliyyah) and towards conditions that are in accordance with syariat. In its development, hijrah refers to a transformation of individuals who are less religious to more religious (Islamī). The form of this transformation can be seen from the choice of clothes, work preferences, and social relations models. The ideological process of the meaning of hijrah was carried out massively through social media. This is based on the search results on the internet about “hijrah” is more than other religious topics. This article answers how and why hijrah is interpreted and articulated by a number of digital activists. This research is qualitative research with a critical discourse analysis method combined with a digital hermeneutic approach. Based on research, digital activists who carry out the ideologization of the meaning of hijrah are preachers who have many followers on social media. Followers on social media are capital and modal in mainstreaming a discourse and idea. This article reveals that religious studies regarding hijrah on social media are not only related to understanding religious texts but are also part of religious commodification. In addition, the dominance of conservative groups is a fact that cannot be separated from the ideological flow of hijrah on social media. © 2023, Program Studi Ilmu Agama Islam Program Magister, Universitas Islam Indonesia.

"Importance: Financial toxicity (FT) is the negative impact of cost of care on financial well-being. Patients with breast cancer are at risk for incurring high out-of-pocket costs given the long-term need for multidisciplinary care and expensive treatments. Objective: To quantify the FT rate of patients with breast cancer and identify particularly vulnerable patient populations nationally and internationally. Data Sources: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Four databases - Embase, PubMed, Global Index Medicus, and Global Health (EBSCO) - were queried from inception to February 2021. Data analysis was performed from March to December 2022. Study Selection: A comprehensive database search was performed for full-text, English-language articles reporting FT among patients with breast cancer. Two independent reviewers conducted study screening and selection; 462 articles underwent full-text review. Data Extraction and Synthesis: A standardized data extraction tool was developed and validated by 2 independent authors; study quality was also assessed. Variables assessed included race, income, insurance status, education status, employment, urban or rural status, and cancer stage and treatment. Pooled estimates of FT rates and their 95% CIs were obtained using the random-effects model. Main Outcomes and Measures: FT was the primary outcome and was evaluated using quantitative FT measures, including rate of patients experiencing FT, and qualitative FT measures, including patient-reported outcome measures or patient-reported severity and interviews. The rates of patients in high-income, middle-income, and low-income countries who incurred FT according to out-of-pocket cost, income, or patient-reported impact of expenditures during breast cancer diagnosis and treatment were reported as a meta-analysis. Results: Of the 11086 articles retrieved, 34 were included in the study. Most studies were from high-income countries (24 studies), and the rest were from low- and middle-income countries (10 studies). The sample size of included studies ranged from 5 to 2445 people. There was significant heterogeneity in the definition of FT. FT rate was pooled from 18 articles. The pooled FT rate was 35.3% (95% CI, 27.3%-44.4%) in high-income countries and 78.8% (95% CI, 60.4%-90.0%) in low- and middle-income countries. Conclusions and Relevance: Substantial FT is associated with breast cancer treatment worldwide. Although the FT rate was higher in low- and middle-income countries, more than 30% of patients in high-income countries also incurred FT. Policies designed to offset the burden of direct medical and nonmedical costs are required to improve the financial health of vulnerable patients with breast cancer.. © 2022 American Medical Association.

"Introduction Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global public health concern and is becoming a significant challenge in the management of patients with cancer. Due to the immunosuppressive nature of cancer treatment, infection is a common complication and the necessary high usage of antibiotics increases the risk of AMR. Failure to adequately prevent and treat infection in patients with cancer as a result of AMR can increase the morbidity and mortality of the disease. The objective of this scoping review is to understand the relationship between AMR and cancer in order to develop effective antimicrobial stewardship in this patient population and minimise the detrimental effects of AMR on cancer outcomes. Methods and analysis This scoping review will follow the Arksey and O'Malley methodology framework. An exploratory review of the literature on antibiotic resistance in cancer care will help to define the research questions (stage 1). A broad range of electronic databases (MEDLINE ALL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Embase) and search terms will be used to retrieve relevant articles published between 2000 and 2021 (stage 2). Studies will be systematically selected based on the eligibility criteria by two independent reviewers (stage 3). The titles and abstracts will be appraised to determine whether articles meet the eligibility criteria. This will be followed by screening of the full texts and only relevant publications will be retrieved. Data will then be extracted, collated and charted (stage 4); and the summary of aggregated results will be presented (stage 5). Ethics and dissemination As this scoping review will collect and synthesise data from publicly available sources, no ethics review is required. When data collection and summarisation is completed, results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and the key findings of the review will be presented at relevant conferences. © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

"Objectives âEffective communication between surgeons and anesthesiologists is critical for high-quality, safe, and efficient perioperative patient care. Despite widespread implementation of surgical safety checklists and time-outs, ineffective team communication remains a leading cause of patient safety events in the operating room. To promote effective communication, we conducted a pilot trial of a virtual huddle between anesthesiologists and surgeons. Methods âAttending anesthesiologists and surgeons at an academic medical center were recruited by email to participate in this feasibility trial. An electronic health record-based smartphone application was utilized to create secure group chats among trial participants the day before a surgery. Text notifications connected a surgeon/anesthesiologist pair in order to introduce colleagues, facilitate a preoperative virtual huddle, and enable open-ended, text message-based communication. A 5-point Likert scale-based survey with a free-Text component was used to evaluate the utility of the virtual huddle and usability of the electronic platform. Results âA total of 51 unique virtual huddles occurred between 16 surgeons and 12 anesthesiologists over 99 operations. All postintervention survey questions received a positive rating (range: 3.50/5.00-4.53/5.00) and the virtual huddle was considered to be easy to use (4.47/5.00), improve attending-To-Attending communication (4.29/5.00), and improve patient care (4.22/5.00). There were no statistically significant differences in the ratings between surgery and anesthesia. In thematic analysis of qualitative survey results, Participants indicated the intervention was particularly useful in interdisciplinary relationship-building and reducing room turnover. The huddle was less useful for simple, routine cases or when participation was one sided. Conclusion âA preoperative virtual huddle may be a simple and effective intervention to improve communication and teamwork in the operating room. Further study and consideration of broader implementation is warranted. © 2023 Georg Thieme Verlag. All rights reserved."
"Objective To investigate the incidence of complications related to thread lift in the treatment of facial rejuvenation. Methods The databases of China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP Chinese Science and Technology Journal Full-text Database (VIP-CSJFD), Wanfang Data, China Biology Medicine (CBM), PubMed, The Cochrane Library and Embase were searched from database establishment to April 20, 2022. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed to include relevant studies that met the criteria. Two investigators independently performed literature screening and data extraction; the STROBE statement scored the quality of inclusion criteria for cross-sectional studies, the total score was 0-22 points, and the research of which score >11 points was considered as high-quality research; data analysis was performed using Stata16.0 software; Egger test and funnel plot analysis were used to evaluate the publication bias of literature. Results Thirty-three articles involving 8 919 patients were included in this meta-analysis. The quality scores of 28 articles were > 11 points, and the remaining 5 articles were exactly 11 points, indicating that the overall quality of the articles was acceptable. The outcome measures of this meta-analysis included 11 indicators such as paresthesia, infection, facial asymmetry, facial nerve injury, mild unevenness or irregular contour, postoperative allergy, postoperative hematoma, pain, wire exposure or visibility, bruising, and swelling. The complication rates for each outcome measure were: paresthesia (1%), infection (0), facial asymmetry (2%), facial nerve injury (0), mild unevenness or contour irregularity (7%), postoperative allergy (0), postoperative hematoma (0), pain (17%), exposed or visible wire (7%), bruising (28%), swelling (55%). Egger test and funnel plot analysis showed that there was no publication bias in sensory abnormalities, facial asymmetry, postoperative allergy and pain. There may be some publication bias in the other 7 indicators. Conclusion Among the complications related to thread lift, postoperative swelling, pain and bruising are the most common, while the incidence of serious complications is rare. Most complications are transient and self-resolving, and in general, thread lift is a relatively safe treatment modality. © 2023 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd."
"Scholars have long been curious about the transmission of religious and philosophical ideas across Eurasia in antiquity. It is well known that Mani named a number of important figures from ""Eastern""religious traditions-such as Buddha and Zoroaster-among his list of prophetic forerunners in an effort to establish his own authority as a religious teacher. Recently published portions of the Dublin codex of the Manichaean Kephalaia provide an additional attestation of this prophetological paradigm in an even more amplified form, as it includes figures not previously attested. Textual analysis of this new testimonium invites us to reflect on how Mani and his early followers imagined their relationships to other religious traditions. It will be shown that, while Manichaean textual traditions were an important conduit of religious information across Eurasia, modern interpreters should be cautious about supposing that ancient readers of Manichaean texts made any meaningful association between the names of these prophetic forerunners and particular doctrines, which by then had been fully naturalized as ""Manichaean""teachings.  © 2023 by the Regents of the University of California."
"Background: The Institute of Family Medicine at the Medical Faculty of Magdeburg offers a course in the cross-sectional subject Q7 “Medicine of Aging and the Elderly” in the 5th year of undergraduate curriculum, in which community institutions are involved in addition to facilities of university medicine. Visits to various facilities in inpatient and community contexts are presented in seminars. Typical syndromes, diseases, and the special handling of diagnostics, treatment, and care of old age are deepened with the help of instant aging units and group exercises. Accompanying lectures complement the concept. Methods: The institute-internal teaching evaluation used standardized, paper–pencil questionnaires with 14 items (winter term 2017/18 and 2018/19). The response rate was about 95% in the winter term 2017/18 and about 85% in 2018/19. The evaluation was descriptive; free text data were evaluated by content analysis. Results: In 2017/18 (n = 170), the overall rating was 2.73 (SD 0.922) and in 2018/19 (n = 156) 2.58 (SD 0.831) on a 5-level grading scale. The visit of the observation sites, the active co-design of the seminars, and the instant aging units were rated positively. Due to the combination of different teaching formats, there were initially redundancies, which were revised for the winter term 2018/19. The desire for more practical exercises and the inclusion of social law aspects was implemented. Conclusions: The combination of lecture, observation, and seminar enables interactional theory–practice transfer as well as self and peer reflection. Practical case vignettes and experiences in different observation sites provide opportunities for interactional exchange during the seminars, so that relevant medical and psychosocial knowledge in medical care of elderly patients is conveyed. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"The article describes the research of the narrative structure of gamebooks as an example of hypertext fiction. The aim of the research is to analyse the storyline of Raymond Queneau's gamebook “A Story of Your Own” as a literary hypertext narrative, to define the peculiarities of its structural organization and to come up with a narrative scheme of the gamebook. The methodology of the research is based on the narrative analysis predicated by the invariant narrative scheme offered by William Labov and Joshua Waletzky. The research novelty lies in the fact that for the first time a narrative analysis of a book-game is carried out taking into account its narrative and hypertext characteristics and the hypernarrative structure of a book-game is described and presented in the form of a scheme. The article dwells on the notions of the narrative, its prototype form and hypertext narrative as being a combination of hypertext and narrative. The author also defines the conception of the hypertext gamebook, follows its evolution. As a result of the analysis of Raymond Queneau's minimalistic gamebook, the author identifies following isomorphic characteristics of a gamebook: nonlinearity and variation of the plot structure, fragmentarity and interactivity (the dialogue between the author, the reader and the text). The gamebook narrative structure utilizes all the narrative components (Abstract, Orientation, Complicating Action, Evaluation, Resolution, Coda), but there are some deviations from the scheme of the prototype linear narrative such as the combination of all narrative components in one, the substantial repetition of a component, the implementation of a component in a different textone, elimination, the presence of narrative polycomponents and their discontinuity, the implementation of a new component of Evaluation by the reader. All these deviations fulfil their definite functions inherent in the game-book. The gamebook structural abnormities are explained by the hypertext strategy of the narration and by interactivity. They create a new fiction space with numerous textual branches, make it possible to expand and to restrict the framework of the narration, boost the narrative dynamics and encourage readers' activity. As a result of the research, the gamebook narrative scheme has been devised and described. This scheme includes potential authorial variations and it can be applied as the basis for the analysis of all kinds of hypertext narratives. © 2023 Tomsk State University. All rights reserved."

"Background and Objectives. Anxiety and depressive disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders, and due to the COVID-19 pandemic, more people are suffering from anxiety and depressive disorders, and a considerable fraction of COVID-19 survivors have a variety of persistent neuropsychiatric problems after the initial infection. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers a different perspective on mental disorders from Western biomedicine. Effective management of mental disorders has become an increasing concern in recent decades due to the high social and economic costs involved. This study attempts to express and ontologize the relationships between different mental disorders and physical organs from the perspective of TCM, so as to bridge the gap between the unique terminology used in TCM and a medical professional. Materials and Methods. Natural language processing (NLP) is introduced to quantify the importance of different mental disorder descriptions relative to the five depots and two palaces, stomach and gallbladder, through the classical medical text Huangdi Neijing and construct a mental disorder ontology based on the TCM classic text. Results. The results demonstrate that our proposed framework integrates NLP and data visualization, enabling clinicians to gain insights into mental health, in addition to biomedicine. According to the results of the relationship analysis of mental disorders, depots, palaces, and symptoms, the organ/depot most related to mental disorders is the heart, and the two most important emotion factors associated with mental disorders are anger and worry & think. The mental disorders described in TCM are related to more than one organ (depot/palace). Conclusion. This study complements recent research delving into co-relations or interactions between mental status and other organs and systems. © 2023 by the authors."
"This systematic review aimed to investigate the scientific literature on volumetric studies concerning the diagnosis and treatment of apical periodontitis using CBCT. A systematic review protocol was written following the preferred reporting items for the systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Four electronic databases were searched for relevant publications in English, which were published up to 21 January 2023. The inclusion criteria and corresponding search keys were applied. The risk of bias was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistic Assessment and Review Instrument. The search strategy identified 202 studies, with 123 studies excluded during the title and abstract screening and 47 studies left for full text screening. A total of 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. The lesion volume was measured and classified according to different indices which compared the effectiveness of their diagnostics. Moreover, the volume of AP lesions increased with the thickness of the maxillary sinus mucosa in primary and secondary infections and decreased due to endodontic treatment. Volumetric measurements using CBCT are useful in the correct definition of periapical tissue pathosis using a CBCT periapical volume index and assessment of the dynamics of the treatment of apical lesions. © 2023 by the authors."
"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to identify the main keywords, network properties, and main topics of news articles related to artificial intelligence technology in the field of nursing. Methods: After collecting artificial intelligence-and nursing-related news articles published between January 1, 1991, and July 24, 2022, keywords were extracted via preprocessing. A total of 3,267 articles were searched, and 2,996 were used for the final analysis. Text network analysis and topic modeling were performed using NetMiner 4.4. Results: As a result of analyzing the frequency of appearance, the keywords used most frequently were education, medical robot, telecom, dementia, and the older adults living alone. Keyword network analysis revealed the following results: a density of 0.002, an average degree of 8.79, and an average distance of 2.43; the central keywords identified were ’education,’ ‘medical robot,’ and ‘fourth industry.’ Five topics were derived from news articles related to artificial intelligence and nursing: ‘Artificial intelligence nursing research and development in the health and medical field,’ ‘Education using artificial intelligence for children and youth care,’ ‘Nursing robot for older adults care,’ ‘Community care policy and artificial intelligence,’ and ‘Smart care technology in an aging society.’ Conclusion: The use of artificial intelligence may be helpful among the local community, older adult, children, and adolescents. In particular, health management using artificial intelligence is indispensable now that we are facing a super-aging society. In the future, studies on nursing intervention and development of nursing programs using artificial intelligence should be conducted. © 2023, Korean Society of Nursing Science. All rights reserved."
"Sentiment analysis is a way to automatically understand and process text data to figure out how someone feels about an opinion sentence. If there are too many reviews, it will take a lot of time and they will start to be biased. Sentiment classification tries to solve this problem by putting user reviews into groups based on whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. The dataset comes from Drone Emprit Academic. It is made up of tweets with the words ""online learning method"" in them, with as many as 4887 data crawled from them. Information Gain and adaboost on the C4.5 (FS+C4.5) method are used in the feature selection method. We use feature options to get rid of bias and improve accuracy. The results of the experiments will be compared to other algorithms like C4.5 and random forest. Based on the results, the accuracy of the two standard decision tree models (C4.5 and random forest) went up from 48.21% and 50.35% to 94.47 %. The value of how accurate it was went up by 44 percent. The FS+C4.5 model, on the other hand, has an RMSE of 0.204 and a correlation of 0.944. So, adding the feature selection technique to the sentiment analysis of bold learning education can make the C4.5 algorithm even more accurate © 2023 Syamsu Rijal et al; published by UIKTEN.

"Clubfoot is a common congenital deformity of the lower limbs. It should be treated as soon as possible so that its correction is more easily achieved. The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of the Ponseti method in the treatment of clubfoot. A bibliographic search was carried out in different databases, including PubMed and SciELO. Filters such as full text and randomized controlled trial were selected to find those articles that best matched our search. Among the results, we selected the ones that interested us, and the rest were discarded, either because they did not meet the requirements for our work or because they were repeated. In total, we collected 19 articles, but after using the critical evaluation instrument CASPe, 7 of them were eliminated, leaving us with a total of 12 articles for our systematic review. After analyzing the results obtained in the selected articles, we concluded that the Ponseti method is effective in the treatment of clubfoot, presenting a high success rate. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background and Aim: Administrative healthcare data are frequently used for studying incidence, prevalence, risk factors, and outcome of pediatric stroke. However, the accuracy of these data sources is uncertain. The aim of this study was to systematically analyze published data on the positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity of diagnoses used to identify pediatric stroke patients in administrative data. Methods: This systematic review was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. We searched PubMed and Embase for studies, published in year 2000 or later, describing the PPV or sensitivity of diagnoses used to identify children with stroke in administrative data. The search was performed on June 9, 2022. Studies written in other languages than English, with less than 30 participants, and conference abstracts were excluded. Results: Eight studies were included after full-Text review from 2,475 potentially eligible records. These included 3,137 children. All studies reported data from high-income countries. Reported PPVs varied considerably across studies and stroke subtypes: Acute ischemic stroke, range 0.27-0.89; cerebral venous thrombosis, range 0.45-0.72; spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage, range 0.52-0.83; and spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, range 0.62-0.66. One study examined sensitivity of an ICD-9 search compared to a radiology report search and found that the ICD search had poor sensitivity (33%). Conclusion: Caution is recommended in the use and interpretation of nonvalidated administrative data for pediatric stroke. Data on the PPV and sensitivity of pediatric stroke diagnoses in administrative data remain limited and are only available from high-income countries.  © 2023 S. Karger AG. All rights reserved."
"Intelligent problem-solving technology is a typical application of artificial intelligence in the educational field. The purpose of intelligent problem-solving is to enable machine to solve problems like human beings and help people to find useful and accurate information in the test-questions. Correct understanding of test-questions is one of the key techniques of intelligent problem-solving. The existing methods are mainly to extract simple relations from text and graphs of test-questions. In the absence of text, deep understanding of graph elements and complex relationships are difficult, which is a challenge for machines. However, the information contained in motion test-question graphs is more abundant than that in the text, which is more beneficial for machine to solve problems. To solve this problem, based on the graph classification and characteristics analysis on test-questions, a novel automatic and weak text-dependent information extraction and thorough understanding method for test-question graph of junior high school physical mechanical motion is proposed (TQGIEU). It can extract information and understand regarding to test-question graphs based on several image preprocessing techniques and neural network topologies combined with the characteristics of test-question graphs, without relying on text processing. It will generate a readable mechanical motion solution at last. It fills the blank of automatic information extraction and thorough understanding for the test-question research of physical mechanical motion. The experimental results show that the accuracy of graph classification and line segmentation model are 99.60% and 90.87% respectively. The average accuracy of TQGIEU on test dataset is 83.08%, and the total F1 score of TQGIEU is 0.859, indicating that TQGIEU can provide a good information extraction and thorough understanding service for test-question graphs of junior high school physical mechanical motion with high performance. © World Scientific Publishing Company."
"It is well known that safety climate (SC) has paramount significance in safety science and accident prevention. In this paper, a bibliometric data mining is conducted to systematically review the research domain of SC. Overall, 1624 documents on SC are obtained, covering 4830 authors, 473 journals, 89 countries/regions, and 1766 institutions between 1980 and 2021. SC has obtained increasing attention since the number of publications related to SC grew from 1 in 1980 to 188 in 2020. Based on the bibliometric data, network analysis was carried out to understand the relationship among different countries/regions, authors, and keywords. Safety Science, Journal of Safety Research, and Accident Analysis and Prevention are the major sources of SC publications, and the USA, Australia, and China lead scientific collaboration production on SC research. Then, text mining of publication keywords is used to identify the hot topics and the evolution of mainstream research over time in the SC domain. The dominant topics in SC research include culture, performance, safety behavior, and model. Meanwhile, the limitations of past research on SC are analyzed and the differences between SC and safety culture are discussed. Moreover, recommendations for future research on SC are also given based on the results of bibliometric analysis and existing literature reviews. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Within the discipline of semiotics, written text remains the primary mode of communication and analysis, despite the fact that, as all good semioticians know, signs occur in all modalities - which is why we think of artists and musicians, no less than novelists and poets, as applied semioticians par excellence. In 1997, Paul Cobley and Litza Jansz combined the semiotic tools of words and drawings to produce what is undoubtedly one of the most successful and influential texts for the dissemination of semiotic theory: the illustrated graphic guide called Semiotics for beginners (later published as Introducing semiotics). On the occasion of this well-deserved festschrift honoring Paul's life of work in semiotics, the authors felt it most appropriate to pay homage to Paul - and to the graphic guide with which he has inspired countless readers across the world to better understand the fundamentals of semiotics - by once again combining the semiotic tools of words and drawings to illustrate the ideas and history of this master semiotician. © 2023 De Gruyter Mouton.

"Accurate prediction of the duration of traffic incidents is one of the most prominent prerequisites for effective implementation of proactive traffic incident management strategies. This paper presents a novel method for immediate prediction of traffic incident duration using an emerging supervised topic modeling. The proposed method employs natural language processing techniques for semantic text analysis of the text-based incident traffic incident dataset. The model applies the labeled latent Dirichlet allocation approach, and it is trained using 1,466 incident records collected by the Korea Expressway Corporation from 2016 to 2019. For training purposes, the proposed method divides the incidents into two groups based on the incident duration: incidents shorter than 2 h and incidents lasting 2 h or longer, following the incident management guidelines of the Federal Highway Administration Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways (2009). The model is tested with randomly selected incident records that were not used for the model training. The results demonstrate overall prediction accuracies of approximately 74% for incidents lasting up to 2 h, and 82% for incidents lasting 2 h or longer. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2022."
"Supervised personal training is most effective in improving the health effects of exercise in older adults. Yet, low frequency (60 min, 1–3 sessions/week) of trainer contact limits influence on behavior change outside sessions. Strategies to extend the effect of trainer contact outside of supervision and that integrate meaningful and intelligent two-way communication to provide complex and interactive problem solving may motivate older adults to “move more and sit less” and sustain positive behaviors to further improve health. This paper describes the experimental protocol of a 16-week pilot RCT (N = 46) that tests the impact of supplementing supervised exercise (i.e., control) with a technology-based behavior-aware text-based virtual “Companion” that integrates a human-in-the-loop approach with wirelessly transmitted sensor-based activity measurement to deliver behavior change strategies using socially engaging, contextually salient, and tailored text message conversations in near-real-time. Primary outcomes are total-daily and patterns of habitual physical behaviors after 16 and 24 weeks. Exploratory analyses aim to understand Companion’s longitudinal behavior effects, its user engagement and relationship to behavior, and changes in cardiometabolic and cognitive outcomes. Our findings may allow the development of a more scalable hybrid AI Companion to impact the ever-growing public health epidemic of sedentariness contributing to poor health outcomes, reduced quality of life, and early death. © 2023 by the authors."
"As part of a business strategy, effective competitive research helps businesses outperform their competitors and attract loyal consumers. To perform competitive research, sentiment analysis may be used to assess interest in certain themes, uncover market conditions, and study competitors. Artificial intelligence (AI) has improved the performance of multiple areas, particularly sentiment analysis. Using AI, sentiment analysis is the process of recognizing emotions expressed in text. AI comprehends the tone of a statement, as opposed to merely recognizing whether particular words within a group of text have a negative or positive connotation. This article reviews papers (2012–2022) that discuss how competitive market research identifies and compares major market measurements that help distinguish the services and goods of the competitors. AI-powered sentiment analysis can be used to learn what the competitors’ customers think of them across all aspects of the businesses. © 2023 by the authors."
"Status Epilepticus (SE) is a neurological emergency resulting from the failure of mechanisms of seizure termination or from the initiation of mechanisms that lead to prolonged seizures. The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) identified 13 chromosomal disorders associated with epilepsy (CDAE); data regarding SE occurrence in these patients is lacking. A systematic scoping review was conducted to outline current literature evidence about clinical features, treatments, and outcomes of SE in pediatric and adult patients with CDAE. A total of 373 studies were identified with the initial search; 65 of these were selected and regarded as SE in Angelman Syndrome (AS, n = 20), Ring 20 Syndrome (R20, n = 24), and other syndromes (n = 21). Non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is frequently observed in AS and R20. No specific, targeted therapies for SE in CDAE are available to date; anecdotal reports about SE treatment are described in the text, as well as various brief- and long-term outcomes. Further evidence is needed to precisely portray the clinical features, treatment options, and outcomes of SE in these patients. © 2023 by the authors."
"Previous quantitative studies discussing interpreting types have focused on various features of linguistic forms in outputs. However, none of them has examined their informativeness. Entropy, as a measure of the average information content and the uniformity of the probability distribution of language units, has been applied to quantitative linguistic research on different types of language texts. In the present study, entropy and repeat rate were used to investigate the difference of overall informativeness and concentration of output texts between simultaneous interpreting and consecutive interpreting. We intend to figure out the frequency distribution patterns of word and word category in two types of interpreting texts. Analyses of linear mixed-effects models showed that entropy and repeat rate can distinguish the informativeness of consecutive and simultaneous interpreting outputs, and consecutive interpreting outputs entail a higher word entropy value and a lower word repeat rate than simultaneous interpreting outputs. We propose that consecutive interpreting is a cognitive process which reaches an equilibrium between production economy for interpreters and comprehension sufficiency for listeners, especially in the case where input speeches are more complex. Our findings also shed lights on the selection of interpreting types in application scenarios. The current research is the first of its kind in examining informativeness across interpreting types, demonstrating a dynamic adaptation of language users to extreme cognitive load. © 2023 by the authors."

"Post-Occupancy Evaluation (POE) began in the 1960s and examines the effectiveness of the design of human-occupied environments. Philippe Boudon published Le Corbusier's Pessac, later translated into English as Lived-In Architecture. Le Corbusier's Pessac revisited. The book presents a series of interviews conducted with those involved in the design process and its inhabitants and is considered a milestone of POE. Numerous research publications have cited Boudon's study from different perspectives, but no text has been located that analyzes his method under the perspective of POE. The goal of this paper is to elaborate a diagram for the systematic comparison of cases of Post-Occupancy Evaluation in housing and to apply it to the analysis of the method proposed by Boudon, identifying its contributions in each aspect. This research is structured in four phases: Location and bibliographic selection on POE in housing; Identification of common topics in the literature for the characterization of POE methods; Creation of the comparative model of evaluation methods; Application of the model to Boudon's study to corroborate its correct functioning. As a result, it has been identified that Lived-In Architecture is a research-initiated assessment, has a general dimension, and focuses on the occupants' perspective. It uses retrospective understanding techniques and takes place during the operation stage of the dwellings with the objective of measuring the performance of the building. Therefore, it is considered within the investigative Post-Occupancy Evaluation studies. © 2023, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya. All rights reserved."
"Anti-HER2 therapies have dramatically improved the prognosis of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing cancers. However, the correlation between the HER2 copy number and the response rate to anti-HER2 remains unclear. Here, following the PRISMA method, we performed a meta-analysis in the neoadjuvant setting in breast cancer to study the association between the HER2 amplification level and the pathological complete response (pCR) to anti-HER2 therapies. Nine articles (four clinical trials, five observational studies) were retrieved after full-text screening, involving 11,238 women with locally advanced breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. The median HER2/CEP17 ratio cut-off value was 5.0 ± 5.0 (min-max = 1.0–14.0). For the overall population, the median pCR rate was 48% using the random effect model. The studies were categorized in quartiles as follows: ≤2 (Class 1); 2.1 to 5.0 (Class 2); 5.1 to 7.0 (Class 3); and >7.0 (Class 4). After grouping, the pCR rates were 33%, 49%, 57%, and 79%, respectively. When we excluded the study by Greenwell et al., which accounted for 90% of the patients, using the same quartiles, we still observed an increasing rate of pCR as the HER2/CEP17 ratio increased. This is the first meta-analysis demonstrating the relationship between the HER2 amplification level and the percentage of pCR in the neoadjuvant setting among women with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer, with potential therapeutic applications. © 2023 by the authors."
"Relation extraction (RE) is a fundamental NLP task that aims to identify relations between some entities regarding a given text. RE forms the basis for many advanced NLP tasks, such as question answering and text summarization, and thus its quality is critical to the relevant downstream applications. However, evaluating the quality of RE models is non-trivial. On the one hand, obtaining ground truth labels for individual test inputs is tedious and even difficult. On the other hand, there is an increasing need to understand the characteristics of RE models in terms of various aspects. To mitigate these issues, this study proposes evaluating RE models by applying metamorphic testing (MT). A total of eight metamorphic relations (MRs) are identified based on three categories of transformation operations, namely replacement, swap, and combination. These MRs encode some expected properties of different aspects of RE. We further apply MT to three popular RE models. Our experiments reveal a large number of prediction failures in the subject RE models, confirming that MT is effective for evaluating RE models. Further analysis of the experimental results reveals the advantages and disadvantages of our subject models and also uncovers some typical issues of RE models. © 2023 by the authors."
"In 2018, in the Dialogue, Debate, and Discussion section of MOR 14.3, an interesting series of articles was published in the 'Forum on Tesla and the Global Automotive Industry', where researchers discussed the future dynamics of the global automotive sector. In their work, Perkins and Murmann (2018) contended that, based on Tesla's success, a well-funded company could develop a new electric vehicle (EV) from scratch and move it into production within three to five years if it would invest one to two billion USD in design, development, and manufacturing. Expressing a contrasting view, MacDuffie (2018) questioned this possibility, arguing that EV product architecture is unlikely to become substantially more modular and any new entrant would therefore have to develop the ordinary capabilities that current automotive original equipment manufacturers possess, and there is no guarantee that a firm can develop such capabilities. Teece (2018) joined the debate by proposing a capability-based framework within which to analyze four paradigm shifts that have marked progress in the global automotive industry: EVs, autonomous vehicles, connected cars, and personal mobility services. He argues that these paradigm shifts have created opportunities for new entrants while posing challenges to incumbent firms. To navigate through the uncertainty associated with these paradigm shifts, incumbent firms need to enhance and refine their dynamic capabilities and leverage their integration skills. Jiang and Lu (2018) based their contribution to this debate on the development of the Chinese EV market. In MOR 15.1, published in 2019, Teece (2019) further elaborated his framework to facilitate analysis of the prospects for Chinese firms seeking a stronger foothold in the global automobile market. All these articles have been well received by MOR readers and were ranked among the top 20 articles in full-text view times between June 2021 and June 2022. Copyright © The Author(s), 2023.

"Based on Shannon’s communication theory, in the present paper, we provide the theoretical background to finding an objective measurement—the text-entropy—that can describe the quality of digital natural language documents handled with word processors. The text-entropy can be calculated from the formatting, correction, and modification entropy, and based on these values, we are able to tell how correct or how erroneous digital text-based documents are. To present how the theory can be applied to real-world texts, for the present study, three erroneous MS Word documents were selected. With these examples, we can demonstrate how to build their correcting, formatting, and modification algorithms, to calculate the time spent on modification and the entropy of the completed tasks, in both the original erroneous and the corrected documents. In general, it was found that using and modifying properly edited and formatted digital texts requires less or an equal number of knowledge-items. In information theory, it means that less data must be put on the communication channel than in the case of erroneous documents. The analysis also revealed that in the corrected documents not only the quantity of the data is less, but the quality of the data (knowledge pieces) is higher. As the consequence of these two findings, it is proven that the modification time of erroneous documents is severalfold of the correct ones, even in the case of minimal first level actions. It is also proven that to avoid the repetition of the time- and resource-consuming actions, we must correct the documents before their modification. © 2023 by the authors."
"Objective: This study reviewed the literature on local or systemic administration of antisclerostin, presenting results associated with osseointegration of dental/orthopedic implants and stimulation of bone remodeling. Materials and Methods: An extensive electronic search was conducted through MED-LINE/PubMed, PubMed Central, Web of Science databases and specific peer-reviewed journals to identify case reports, case series, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials and animal studies comparing either the systemic or local administration of antisclerostin and its effect in osseointegration and bone remodeling. Articles in English and with no restriction on period were included. Results: Twenty articles were selected for a full-text, and one was excluded. Finally, 19 articles were included in the study (16 animal studies and 3 randomized control trials). These studies were divided into two groups, which evaluated (i) osseointegration and (ii) bone remodeling potential. Initially 4560 humans and 1191 animals were identified. At least 1017 were excluded from the studies (981 humans and 36 animals), totaling 4724 subjects who completed (3579 humans and 1145 animals). (a) Osseointegration: 7 studies described this phenomenon; 4 reported bone-implant contact, which increased in all included studies. Similar results were found for bone mineral density, bone area/volume and bone thickness. (b) Bone remodeling: 13 studies were used for description. The studies reported an increase in BMD with sclerostin antibody treatment. A similar effect was found for bone mineral density/area/volume, trabecular bone and bone formation. Three biomarkers of bone formation were identified: bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), osteocalcin and procollagen type 1 N-terminal Pro-peptide (P1NP); and markers for bone resorption were: serum C-telopeptide (sCTX), C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX-1), β-isomer of C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (β-CTX) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (TRACP-5b). There were limitations: low number of human studies identified; high divergence in the model used (animal or human); the variance in the type of Scl-Ab and doses of administration; and the lack of reference quantitative values in the parameters analyzed by authors’ studies (many articles only reported qualitative information). Conclusion: Within the limitations of this review and carefully observing all data, due to the number of articles included and the heterogeneity existing, more studies must be carried out to better evaluate the action of the antisclerostin on the osseointegration of dental implants. Otherwise, these findings can accelerate and stimulate bone remodeling and neoformation. © 2023 by the authors."
"Data visualization facilitates the overall analysis and in-depth mining of data. However, visualized data in the form of images are not conducive to machine understanding, which means it cannot meet the requirements of subsequent automated intelligent systems for practical engineering projects. The traditional method of curve image data reconstruction relying on manual features obtains the reconstructed data by point selection method or image pre-processing combined with manual input of coordinate axis information. Its accuracy and efficiency are low, and it does not have the characteristics of automation and high-volume processing. To solve this problem, we propose an end-to-end convolutional neural network model based on a deep learning approach. The model adopts a multi-task co-encoding-independent decoding structure, and combines an attention mechanism to effectively improve the information quality during the jump connection process to achieve multi-task joint learning for curve segmentation and text detection. We validate the effectiveness of the model on a curve image dataset, where the accuracy of curve segmentation and text detection achieved 94.0% and 99.5%, respectively. ICIC International ©2023."
"Background: Around 500/100,000 Canadians experience a traumatic brain injury (TBI) resulting in long-term disabilities and premature death. Physiotherapy is known to positively impact the prognosis of young adults following a TBI. Objective: This is a scoping review that aimed to identify research topics in physiotherapy interventions for seniors after a TBI, describe potential knowledge gaps, and uncover needs for future research. Methodology: Ten databases were interrogated (January–March 2022). We included texts published after 2010, in English or French, scientific papers, guidelines, and gray literature sources targeting in-hospital, acute-to-subacute interventions for people aged ≥55 years old with a moderate-to-severe TBI. The outcomes sought were physical/functional capacities, injury severity, and quality of life. Results: From 1296 articles, 16 were selected. The number of participants from the studies altogether was 248,794. We identified eight retrospectives studies, three clinical trials, and five articles from the gray literature. Articles were classified according to the nature of their analysis and outcomes: (1) interventional studies including physiotherapy (at least 10 types of rehabilitative or preventive interventions were identified); (2) studies evaluating prognostic factors (five factors identified); and (3) recommendations from clinical practical guidelines and other sources (gray literature). Our results provide evidence that physiotherapy is effective in TBI acute rehabilitation for the elderly to prevent complications arising from the primary injury and to improve functional capacities. Conclusion: The heterogeneity of our results does not allow us to infer the effectiveness of one intervention over another. However, we found that the elderly population benefits from physiotherapy interventions as much as adults, but the gap must be filled with higher-quality studies to make definite recommendations. © 2023 by the authors."
"Medical treatment and narratives are interrelated. We examined this interrelation by evaluating the medical dispute mediation system in Taiwan. We conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with legal and administrative specialists in medical mediation and physicians involved in mediation meetings. The interview data were reproduced into almost verbatim text for coding and analysis. We examined how narratives were discussed in the field of medicine and identified two approaches to narratives. One was the narrative from a patient's storytelling, that is, narrative-based medicine. The other was the narrative of medical staff, which included shared decision-making and decision aids. Discussions of these approaches revolved around the avoidance of conflicts during medical treatment. However, knowing how to handle unsuccessful medical treatment is crucial. By applying polyphony in narratives, physicians can comprehend the role of narratives in unsuccessful medical treatment, helping themselves to practice how to develop narratives to communicate with patients and their surrogates when encountering any difficulty in different stages of medical treatment. © 2023 The Authors"
The Ethiopian magic scrolls are traditional parchment artifacts used by the Christians of Ethiopia as protection against disease and demonic possessions. On the occasion of their restoration in the Accademia delle Belle Arti di Bologna (Italy); a preliminary characterization before the treatments has been performed on four Ethiopian scrolls belonging to the Archivio storico della provincia di Cristo Re dei Frati Minori dell’Emilia Romagna of Bologna (Italy). In order to plan an effective preservative restoration procedure and; at the same time; to investigate the manufacturing techniques; the text and the decorations on the magic scrolls were studied and characterized. A combined approach by imaging and compositional techniques was used: Infrared Reflectography (IRR) for the preliminary characterization of the graphic supports and the identification of the points to sample the chemical measurements; and the spectroscopic analyses to clarify the hypothesized investigations and confirm the chemical composition of the inks. In particular; Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy has provided information relating to the molecular composition of inks and pigments; while a characterization of the constituent elements is obtained with the Ion Beam Analysis (IBA). The ink composition proved to be consistent with data generally documented in the literature and contributing to the expansion of knowledge on Ethiopian magic scrolls and their production. © 2023 by the authors.
"Wearable activity trackers and smartphone apps have been shown to increase physical activity in children and adults. However, interventions using activity trackers and apps have rarely been tested in whole families. This study examined the experience and satisfaction with an activity tracker and app intervention (Step it Up Family) to increase physical activity in whole families. Telephone interviews were conducted with Queensland-based families (n = 19) who participated in the Step it Up Family intervention (N = 40, single-arm, pre/post feasibility study) in 2017/2018. Using commercial activity trackers combined with apps, the intervention included an introductory session, individual and family-level goal setting, self-monitoring, family step challenges, and weekly motivational text messages. Qualitative content analysis was conducted to identify themes, categories and sub-categories. In summary, parents reported that children were engaged with the activity tracker and app features to reach their daily step goals. Some technical difficulties were experienced with app navigation, syncing of activity tracker data, and tracker band discomfort. Although families liked that the weekly text messages reminded them to be active, they did not find them very motivating. Using text messages for physical activity motivation in families requires further testing. Overall, the intervention was well-received by families for increasing physical activity motivation. © 2023 by the authors."

"The strength of weak ties and brokerage theory both rely on the argument that weak bridging ties deliver novel information to create “vision advantages” for actors in brokerage positions. However, our conceptualization of novelty is itself fundamentally underdeveloped. We, therefore, develop a theory of how three distinct types of novelty-diversity, non-redundancy, and uniqueness-combine with network structure to create vision advantages in social networks. We test this theory using panel data on an evolving corporate email network. Three main results emerge from our analysis. First, we confirm the diversity-bandwidth tradeoff (DBT) at the heart of the vision advantage. As brokers' networks become more diverse, their channel bandwidth contracts, creating countervailing effects on access to novel information. Second, we uncover a mechanism driving the DBT, which helps explain differences in vision advantages across strong and weak ties. Strong, cohesive ties deliver greater information diversity and non-redundancy, whereas weak bridging ties contribute the most unique information (the information that is most different from what other contacts deliver). Third, we find network diversity (in contrast to network constraint) to be positively associated with longitudinal entropy, a measure of the accumulation of novel information over time. This suggests that weak bridging ties, which provide the most unique information through low bandwidth, structurally diverse channels, contribute the most to one's aggregation of novel information over time. Collectively, these results take a step toward resolving a long-standing debate in network theory about whether strong, cohesive networks or weak bridging networks contribute more to vision advantages. This work firmly establishes that it depends. Copyright: © 2022 INFORMS."
"Chagas disease (CD) is endemic in large parts of Central and South America, as well as in Texas and the southern regions of the United States. Successful parasites, such as the causative agent of CD, Trypanosoma cruzi have adapted to specific hosts during their phylogenesis. In this work, we have assembled an interactive network of the complex relations that occur between molecules within T. cruzi. An expert curation strategy was combined with a text-mining approach to screen 10,234 full-length research articles and over 200,000 abstracts relevant to T. cruzi. We obtained a scale-free network consisting of 1055 nodes and 874 edges, and composed of 838 proteins, 43 genes, 20 complexes, 9 RNAs, 36 simple molecules, 81 phenotypes, and 37 known pharmaceuticals. Further, we deployed an automated docking pipeline to conduct large-scale docking studies involving several thousand drugs and potential targets to identify network-based binding propensities. These experiments have revealed that the existing FDA-approved drugs benznidazole (Bz) and nifurtimox (Nf) show comparatively high binding energies to the T. cruzi network proteins (e.g., PIF1 helicase-like protein, trans-sialidase), when compared with control datasets consisting of proteins from other pathogens. We envisage this work to be of value to those interested in finding new vaccines for CD, as well as drugs against the T. cruzi parasite. © 2023 by the authors."

"As an important infrastructure in the era of big data, the knowledge graph can integrate and manage data resources. Therefore, the construction of tourism knowledge graphs with wide coverage and of high quality in terms of information from the perspective of tourists’ needs is an effective solution to the problem of information clutter in the tourism field. This paper first analyzes the current state of domestic and international research on constructing tourism knowledge graphs and highlights the problems associated with constructing knowledge graphs, which are that they are time-consuming, laborious and have a single function. In order to make up for these shortcomings, this paper proposes a set of systematic methods to build a tourism knowledge graph. This method integrates the BiLSTM and BERT models and combines these with the attention mechanism. The steps of this methods are as follows: First, data preprocessing is carried out by word segmentation and removing stop words; second, after extracting the features and vectorization of the words, the cosine similarity method is used to classify the tourism text, with the text classification based on naive Bayes being compared through experiments; third, the popular tourism words are obtained through the popularity analysis model. This paper proposes two models to obtain popular words: One is a multi-dimensional tourism product popularity analysis model based on principal component analysis; the other is a popularity analysis model based on emotion analysis; fourth, this paper uses the BiLSTM-CRF model to identify entities and the cosine similarity method to predict the relationship between entities so as to extract high-quality tourism knowledge triplets. In order to improve the effect of entity recognition, this paper proposes entity recognition based on the BiLSTM-LPT and BiLSTM-Hanlp models. The experimental results show that the model can effectively improve the efficiency of entity recognition; finally, a high-quality tourism knowledge was imported into the Neo4j graphic database to build a tourism knowledge graph. © 2023 by the authors."

"Gérard Genette believes that different texts are influenced by earlier works. He divides the relations between texts into five categories: Intertextualitie, Architextualite, Paratextualite, Metatextualite, and Hypertextualite. Since one of the most important issues in comparative literature is literary influence, and Genette in transtextuality theory explores the impact of texts on one another, it can be said that transtextuality is of great significance in comparative literature. Vampires are European legends that have attracted teenage audience, and Golshiri has introduced this genre to Iranian fiction for the first time. In this research, using the content analysis method, we want to examine Meyer’s vampire novels and Golshiri's Vampire according to their transtextual relations in order to answer the following questions: how is the primary text transferred to the secondary text in Golshiri’s Vampire? Which elements of transtextuality are used by Golshiri in his works? In what ways have the cultural relations influenced the secondary text? It is argued that in his works, Golshiri has used the intertextualitie, architextualite, paratextualite, and hypertextualite, and Iranian cultural relations have caused changes in the story. © The Author(s)."
"Renal transplantation is the gold-standard treatment for adolescents and young adults with end-stage renal disease. Despite enjoying excellent short-term outcomes, they suffer the worst rates of premature transplant function loss. Health behaviors: such as lack of adherence to immunosuppressive medications, are felt to be the major contributory factor. Understanding the educational needs of young renal transplant recipients allows healthcare practitioners to better support patients in managing their chronic disease. The aim of this scoping review was to understand what is known about their educational needs. A scoping review methodology was followed. Following an online search, study titles, and abstracts were screened for eligibility, followed by full-text assessment and data extraction. Data were qualitatively analyzed using thematic analysis. A total of 29 studies were included in the scoping review. In young people who struggled with self-management, three themes were identified (1) the Needs of the disrupted youth, (2) the Needs of the disorganized youth (3) the Needs of the distressed youth. There was a paucity of research to identify the protective factors that enable young recipients to successfully manage their health. This review outlines current knowledge of the patient education needs of young transplant recipients. It also highlights remaining research gaps that will need to be addressed with future research. © 2023 by the authors."
"Engineering underpins the progress of modern societies. However, engineering activities are a key driver of climate change and engineers are responsible in many ways for disaster risk reduction. It is therefore imperative that engineering education accurately portrays the impact that the profession has on our climate and equips engineers with the knowledge to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and to adapt infrastructure for climate resilience. Here, we explore how higher education prepares engineers to address the climate crisis via a curricula analysis of three departments (mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering). The pilot study investigated the extent of mitigation and adaptation to climate change (MACC) content across different disciplines by developing and applying an evaluation methodology. We found that module descriptions and learning objectives were largely without reference to MACC, further evidencing the dissociation of engineering education from the climate reality as cited in the literature.

"In recent years, overlapping entity relation extraction has received a great deal of attention and has made good progress in English. However, the research on overlapping entity relation extraction in Chinese still faces two key problems: one is the lack of datasets with overlapping entity instances, and the other is the lack of a neural network model that can effectively solve overlapping entity relation extraction. To address the above problems, this paper produces an interpersonal relationship dataset, NewsPer, for news texts and proposes a Chinese overlapping entity relation extraction model, DepCasRel. First, the model uses “Word-label” to incorporate the character features of Chinese text into the dependency analysis graph, and then uses the same binary labeling method to label the head and tail entities embedded in the text. Finally, the text’s triples are extracted. DepCasRel solves the problem that traditional methods make it difficult to extract triples with overlapping entities. Experiments on our manually annotated dataset NewsPer show that DepCasRel can effectively encode the semantic and structural information of text and improve the performance of an overlapping entity relation extraction model. © 2023 by the authors."
"This article reveals the continuity of Neoplatonic ideas in Greek-Byzantine patristics in the process of elaboration of the triadic dogma by the Church Fathers. Common and distinctive principles of Neoplatonism and Eastern Christianity are deduced from the point of view of the shaping of Christian ethics and the processing of Neoplatonic concepts in patristic texts. In more specific terms, Plotinus’ concept of the triad of the One–the Intellect–the Soul is considered, with special attention paid to analysis of the philosopher’s ideas of the One as Deity and the Origin of the world. It describes the process of emanation of the Neoplatonic trinity hypostasis and its connection with the material world through the World Soul. In comparison with Neoplatonism, the authors of the article present the molding of the dogma of the Holy Trinity in classical Greek-Byzantine patristics and highlight the new, theological-ethical vision of Plotinus’ triad as a form of the interconnection of the three Persons of the Trinity, expressing the absoluteness of interpersonal relations. In terms of philosophical ethics, the authors state that the Church Fathers’ understanding of the relationship among the three hypostases of the Holy Trinity serves as a model of perfect moral relationships demonstrating the absolute norms of morality for a human being. Neoplatonism was deprived of such a context in its interpretation of Plotinus’ triad. The creative and critical perception of Plotinus’ conceptual positions in the works of St. Athanasius is presented. Conclusions are made about the creative, sometimes critical, perception of the ideas of Neoplatonism in the formation of a new type of Christian ethics. © 2023 by the authors."
"The scholarly field of organizational prosociality is experiencing a renewed interest, yet despite its long track record, researchers still disagree on the definitions of primary concepts. Two umbrella terms, prosocial behaviors and kindness, are particularly baffling, as they are defined similarly, at times used synonymously, yet the differences between them are unclear. Consequently, the field suffers from conceptual ambiguity, which hampers its development. In this brief critical paper, we provide a review of the definitions of prosocial behavior and kindness, in an attempt to semantically untie the text, unpack the context, and discuss the subtext that underlies these concepts. Our analysis suggests that the two concepts overlap in their emphasis on dispositions and actions that aim to promote the welfare of others. However, acts of kindness and prosocial behaviors differ in actors, their target recipients and scale. Acts of kindness are performed by an individual and directed at a person or a small group, while prosocial behaviors can be performed by a person or an organization, and can be directed at a person or a group, but may also be directed at a much larger entity: an organization, community, nation, or society at large. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Several federal policies and initiatives emphasize collecting patients’ experience during pharmaceutical development processes. Family caregivers, who commonly manage a patient or care recipient's medications, are increasingly engaged in healthcare settings but are not yet formally involved in pharmaceutical development processes. To explore the potential benefit of such inclusion, we conducted a systematic literature review of U.S. studies pertaining to caregivers’ engagement in pharmaceutical assessment and development. We sought to: (1) quantify the number of analyses in the U.S. that incorporated caregiver evaluation of therapeutic agents, medications, or pharmaceuticals; (2) explore the characteristics of such studies (e.g., care context; patient age); and, (3) synthesize findings pertaining to caregiver engagement. Methodology: We assessed articles in PubMed and Google Scholar with specified search terms and eligibility criteria. Results: Our review identified 25 full-text articles on studies involving pediatric (n = 13) and adult patient (n = 12) populations. Most articles pertained to pharmaceutical assessment for ADHD and epilepsy among pediatric patients and to neurodegenerative-related disease among adult patients. Only a few studies in each patient population, pediatric and adult, compared patient and caregiver assessments for agreement or explored patient and caregiver outcomes. Conclusions: Findings suggest an opportunity for research on patient and caregiver agreement in medication evaluation as well as assessment of patient and caregiver outcomes as a result of caregiver engagement. Such analyses should also extend beyond pediatric and neurodegenerative care given that caregivers are shown to be included in treatment-decision making in other care contexts. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS"
"This research aims to carry out a systematic review of the available literature about smart irrigation systems. It will be focused on systems using artificial intelligence techniques in urban and rural agriculture for soil crops to identify those that are currently being used or can be adapted to urban agriculture. To this end, a modified PRISMA 2020 method is applied, and three search equations are formulated. From those filters, and after a screening process, 170 articles are obtained. These articles are analyzed through VantagePoint, a text processing software. After this, they are taken through a detailed analysis phase in which 50 sources are selected as the most relevant to be read and analyzed by topic. Finally, the different phases of the analysis are used to draw conclusions that might be interesting for researchers working in this specific field or for the general public interested in rural and urban agriculture and its automation. © 2023 by the authors."
"COVID-19 vaccines have saved millions of lives; however, understanding the long-term effectiveness of these vaccines is imperative to developing recommendations for booster doses and other precautions. Comparisons of mortality rates between more and less vaccinated groups may be misleading due to selection bias, as these groups may differ in underlying health status. We studied all adult deaths during the period of 1 April 2021–30 June 2022 in Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, linked to vaccination records, and we used mortality from other natural causes to proxy for underlying health. We report relative COVID-19 mortality risk (RMR) for those vaccinated with two and three doses versus the unvaccinated, using a novel outcome measure that controls for selection effects. This measure, COVID Excess Mortality Percentage (CEMP), uses the non-COVID natural mortality rate (Non-COVID-NMR) as a measure of population risk of COVID mortality without vaccination. We validate this measure during the pre-vaccine period (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.97) and demonstrate that selection effects are large, with non-COVID-NMRs for two-dose vaccinees often less than half those for the unvaccinated, and non-COVID NMRs often still lower for three-dose (booster) recipients. Progressive waning of two-dose effectiveness is observed, with an RMR of 10.6% for two-dose vaccinees aged 60+ versus the unvaccinated during April–June 2021, rising steadily to 36.2% during the Omicron period (January–June, 2022). A booster dose reduced RMR to 9.5% and 10.8% for ages 60+ during the two periods when boosters were available (October–December, 2021; January–June, 2022). Boosters thus provide important additional protection against mortality. © 2023 by the authors."
"Radical/extremist Islamist actors use social media to disseminate uncompromising stories of monist religious political orders and identities. As a reaction, counter-movements to online Islamist radicalism/extremism emerged in Western societies (and beyond), while uncertainty about effective outcomes remains widespread. In a bid to understand how inclusionary and exclusionary discursive spaces are created, we ask: How do some Muslim actors create discursive spaces open to self-reflection, pluralism and liberal-democratic principles, while others construct illiberal, particularistic and non/anti-democratic spaces? To respond to this question, we compare two contrasting storytellers, one who agitates for exclusionary Islamist radicalism/extremism (Generation Islam) and one who offers inclusionary prevention and deradicalization work against that (Jamal al-Khatib). We draw on novel narrative approaches to the Discourse Historical Approach (DHA) in Critical Discourse Studies (CDS), via which we compare text-level and context-level narratives disseminated about three Muslim-related crises: the racist terrorist attacks/genocide to represent the national, European and global level. Our two-layered, DHA-inspired narrative analysis illustrates that, at the level of text, narrative persuasion varies between both contrasting actors. While Jamal al-Khatib disseminates persuasive stories, Generation Islam is much less invested in narrative persuasion; it seems to address an already convinced audience. These two text-level strategies reveal their meaning in two antagonistic narrative genres: Jamal al-Khatib’s “self-reflexive savior” creates an inclusionary discursive space represented in a self-ironic narrative genre, while Generation Islam’s ”crusading savior” manufactures an exclusionary discursive space represented in a romance featuring a nostalgic return to the particularistic Islamic umma. © 2023 by the authors."
"Purpose There is robust evidence for offering supported self-management interventions for people with severe mental illness (SMI) throughout secondary mental health services, but their availability remains patchy. The aim of this systematic review is to synthesise the evidence on barriers and facilitators to implementing self-management interventions for people with SMI in secondary mental health care settings. Methods The review protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021257078). Five databases were searched to identify relevant studies. We included full-text journal articles with primary qualitative or quantitative data on factors which affect the implementation of self-management interventions for people with SMI in secondary mental health services. The included studies were analysed using narrative synthesis, using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and an established taxonomy of implementation outcomes. Results Twenty-three studies from five countries met eligibility criteria. The barriers and facilitators identified in the review were mainly on the organisational level, but included some individual-level influences. Facilitators included high feasibility, high fidelity, a strong team structure, sufficient number of staff, support from colleagues, staff training, supervision, the presence of an implementation champion and adaptability of the intervention. Barriers to implementation include high staff turnover, staff shortage, lack of supervision, lack of support for staff delivering the programme, staff struggling with their increased workload, a lack of senior clinical leadership, and programme content perceived as irrelevant. Conclusion The findings from this research suggest promising strategies to improve implementation of self-management interventions. For services providing support for people with SMI, organisational culture should be considered, as well as the adaptability of interventions. © 2023 Islam et al.

"There is concern among the general public that information technology (IT) innovations may make existing jobs redundant. This may be perceived to pose a greater problem to future generations because new technologies, not limited to IT innovations, will be sophisticated in the future. Our previous work revealed that messages reminding people of familial support as a nudge can moderate risk-averse attitudes toward risks that are perceived to threaten future generations, which could be effective for other kinds of risks. Therefore, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the message effects for information provision on IT innovations. The study was conducted via an online questionnaire survey in January 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic, and more than 3,200 samples were collected from respondents aged 20 years or older living in Japan. The treatment groups received basic information supplemented with additional text or additional text and an illustration that highlighted IT innovations as support from previous generations. The control group received only the basic textual information. The effects of the intervention were evaluated by comparing changes in average subjective assessment of IT in the treatment groups with those in the control group. The intervention effect was statistically significant, and the sense of familial support after receiving the intervention messages was significantly increased in the treatment group that viewed the illustration compared with the control group. Additionally, we discuss how each component of the HEXACO personality traits influences responses to the intervention messages. Through a series of surveys, we demonstrated the potential of our framework for a wide variety of applications involving information provision perceived to involve future generations. © 2023 Komatsu et al.

"Introduction Sarcoidosis is a rare systemic inflammatory granulomatous disease of unknown cause. It can manifest in any organ. The incidence of sarcoidosis varies across countries, and by ethnicity and gender. Delays in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis can lead to extension of the disease and organ impairment. Diagnosis delay is attributed in part to the lack of a single diagnostic test or unified commonly used diagnostic criteria, and to the diversity of disease manifestations and symptom load. There is a paucity of evidence examining the determinants of diagnostic delay in sarcoidosis and the experiences of people with sarcoidosis related to delayed diagnosis. We aim to systematically review available evidence about diagnostic delay in sarcoidosis to elucidate the factors associated with diagnostic delay for this disease in different contexts and settings, and the consequences for people with sarcoidosis. Methods and analysis A systematic search of the literature will be conducted using PubMed/Medline, Scopus, and ProQuest databases, and sources of grey literature, up to 25th of May 2022, with no limitations on publication date. We will include all study types (qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods) except review articles, examining diagnostic delay, incorrect diagnosis, missed diagnosis or slow diagnosis of all types of sarcoidosis across all age groups. We will also examine evidence of patients' experiences associated with diagnostic delay. Only studies in English, German and Indonesian will be included. The outcomes we examine will be diagnostic delay time, patients' experiences, and factors associated with diagnostic delay in sarcoidosis. Two people will independently screen the titles and abstracts of search results, and then the remaining full-text documents against the inclusion criteria. Disagreements will be resolved with a third reviewer until consensus is reached. Selected studies will be appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT). A meta-analysis and subgroup analyses of quantitative data will be conducted. Meta-aggregation methods will be used to analyse qualitative data. If there is insufficient data for these analyses, a narrative synthesis will be conducted. Discussion This review will provide systematic and integrated evidence on the diagnostic delay, associated factors, and experiences of diagnosis delay among people with all types of sarcoidosis. This knowledge may shed light on ways to improve diagnosis delays in diagnosis across different subpopulations, and with different disease presentations. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval will not be required as no human recruitment or participation will be involved. Findings of the study will be disseminated through publications in peer-reviewed journals, conferences, and symposia.  © 2023 Namsrai et al.

"The gut microbiota has been immensely studied over the past years because of its involvement in the pathogenesis of numerous diseases. However, gut microbiota data in Africa are limited. Therefore, it is crucial to have studies that reflect various populations in order to fully capture global microbial diversity. In the proposed scoping review, we will describe the gut microbiota’s appearance in terms of gut microbiota markers, in both health and disease in African populations. Relevant publications will be searched for in the PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Academic Search Premier, Africa-Wide Information, African journals online, CINAHL, and EBSCOhost and Embase databases. We will focus on articles published between January 2005 and March 2023. We will also determine if the studies to be included in the review would provide enough data to identify quantifiable gut microbiome traits that could be used as health or disease markers, identify the types of diseases that were mostly focused on in relation to gut microbiota research in Africa, as well as to discover and analyze knowledge gaps in the gut microbiota research field in the continent. We will include studies involving African countries regardless of race, gender, age, health status, disease type, study design, or care setting. Two reviewers will conduct a literature search and screen the titles/abstracts against the eligibility criteria. The reviewers will subsequently screen full-text articles and identify studies that meet the inclusion criteria. This will be followed by charting the data using a charting tool and analysis of the evidence. The proposed scoping review will follow a qualitative approach such that a narrative summary will accompany the tabulated/graphical results which will describe how the results relate to the review objectives and questions. As a result, this review may play a significant role in the identification of microbiota-related adjunctive therapies in the African region where multiple comorbidities coexist.

"Academic societies and funding bodies that conduct peer reviews need to select the best reviewers in each field to ensure publication quality. Conventional approaches for reviewer selection focus on evaluating expertise based on research relevance by subject or discipline. An improved perceiving conflict of interest (CoI) reviewer recommendation process that combines the five expertise indices and graph analysis techniques is proposed in this paper. This approach collects metadata from the academic database and extracts candidates based on research field similarities utilizing text mining; then, the candidate scores are calculated and ranked through a professionalism index-based analysis. The highly connected subgraphs (HCS) algorithm is used to cluster similar researchers based on their association or intimacy in the researcher network. The proposed method is evaluated using root mean square error (RMSE) indicators for matching the field of publication and research fields of the recommended experts using keywords of papers published in Korean journals over the past five years. The results show that the system configures a group of Top-K reviewers with an RMSE 0.76. The proposed method can be applied to the academic society and national research management system to realize fair and efficient screening and management. © 2023 by the authors."
"Knowledge graph technology has distinct advantages in terms of fault diagnosis. In this study, the control rod drive mechanism (CRDM) of the liquid fuel thorium molten salt reactor (TMSR-LF1) was taken as the research object, and a fault diagnosis system was proposed based on knowledge graph. The subject–relation–object triples are defined based on CRDM unstructured data, including design specification, operation and maintenance manual, alarm list, and other forms of expert experience. In this study, we constructed a fault event ontology model to label the entity and relationship involved in the corpus of CRDM fault events. A three-layer robustly optimized bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (RBT3) pre-training approach combined with a text convolutional neural network (TextCNN) was introduced to facilitate the application of the constructed CRDM fault diagnosis graph database for fault query. The RBT3-TextCNN model along with the Jieba tool is proposed for extracting entities and recognizing the fault query intent simultaneously. Experiments on the dataset collected from TMSR-LF1 CRDM fault diagnosis unstructured data demonstrate that this model has the potential to improve the effect of intent recognition and entity extraction. Additionally, a fault alarm monitoring module was developed based on WebSocket protocol to deliver detailed information about the appeared fault to the operator automatically. Furthermore, the Bayesian inference method combined with the variable elimination algorithm was proposed to enable the development of a relatively intelligent and reliable fault diagnosis system. Finally, a CRDM fault diagnosis Web interface integrated with graph data visualization was constructed, making the CRDM fault diagnosis process intuitive and effective. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to China Science Publishing & Media Ltd.

"One important application of natural language processing (NLP) is the recognition of emotions in text. Most current emotion analyzers use a set of linguistic features such as emotion lexicons, n-grams, word embeddings, and emoticons. This study proposes a new strategy to perform emotion recognition, which is based on the homologous structure of emotions and narratives. It is argued that emotions and narratives share both a goal-based structure and an evaluation structure. The new strategy was tested in an empirical study with 117 participants who recounted two narratives about their past emotional experiences, including one positive and one negative episode. Immediately after narrating each episode, the participants reported their current affective state using the Affect Grid. The goal-based structure and evaluation structure of the narratives were analyzed with a hybrid method. First, a linguistic analysis of the texts was carried out, including tokenization, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and morphological analysis. Second, an extensive set of rule-based algorithms was used to analyze the goal-based structure of, and evaluations in, the narratives. Third, the output was fed into machine learning classifiers of narrative structural features that previously proved to be effective predictors of the narrator’s current affective state. This hybrid procedure yielded a high average F1 score (0.72). The results are discussed in terms of the benefits of employing narrative structure analysis in NLP-based emotion recognition. © 2023 by the authors."
"Deep learning has improved the state-of-the-art in sentiment analysis for various languages, including Arabic. One aspect that can affect the performance of deep learning-based sentiment classification is the optimization method used for training the neural network. The conventional optimization method is carried out by a backpropagation (BP) algorithm that relies on gradient descent to find the minimum of a cost function. However, BP has the tendency to converge into local minima instead of global minima since neural networks generate complex error surfaces for even simple problems. In this study, for the purpose of improving the Arabic sentiment classification, we propose to use a genetic algorithm (GA) to train a deep neural network (DNN). GA is a meta-heuristic optimization algorithm inspired by the theory of natural evolution. The algorithm is expected to improve the classifier’s performance due to its capability to reach optimal or near-optimal solutions. The proposed method uses Arabic sentiment lexicons to extract various features considering different aspects for text representation. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated by analyzing its performance, versus a DNN trained with BP algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can present better F1-measure of 90.7% for Arabic sentiment classification than traditional BP-based DNN. © 2023 International Information and Engineering Technology Association.

"There is an increasing motivation to implement pharmacist-led screening services in community pharmacies. This study aims to develop tools to support the pharmacist in the context of a diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk assessment service. Our development involved a multistep process using a user-centred approach, including a need assessment phase (14 patients, 17 pharmacists) and a creative design phase, followed by the evaluation of the materials (10 patients, 16 pharmacists). Three following themes covering educational needs emerged from stakeholders’ discussions: “content”, “layout”, and “form”, with three additional themes regarding the practical organisation: “software”, “awareness”, and “referral”. Based on the need assessment, tools for patient education purposes and awareness campaigns were created. During the development, special attention was paid to the writing style and structure with less text and more graphical colourful elements to suit patients with different health literacy and educational levels. The evaluation phase allowed researchers to observe participants engaging with the materials. Overall, participants were satisfied with the tools. The contents were considered valuable and relevant. However, adaptations were necessary to ensure their understanding and long-term usability. Finally, future research is required to evaluate the materials’ impact on patients’ behaviour towards their identified risk factors and ensure their effectiveness. © 2023 by the authors."
"Drug abuse is a serious problem in the United States, with over 90,000 drug overdose deaths nationally in 2020. A key step in combating drug abuse is detecting, monitoring, and characterizing its trends over time and location, also known as pharmacovigilance. While federal reporting systems accomplish this to a degree, they often have high latency and incomplete coverage. Social-media-based pharmacovigilance has zero latency, is easily accessible and unfiltered, and benefits from drug users being willing to share their experiences online pseudo-anonymously. However, unlike highly structured official data sources, social media text is rife with misspellings and slang, making automated analysis difficult. Generative Pretrained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is a large autoregressive language model specialized for few-shot learning that was trained on text from the entire internet. We demonstrate that GPT-3 can be used to generate slang and common misspellings of terms for drugs of abuse. We repeatedly queried GPT-3 for synonyms of drugs of abuse and filtered the generated terms using automated Google searches and cross-references to known drug names. When generated terms for alprazolam were manually labeled, we found that our method produced 269 synonyms for alprazolam, 221 of which were new discoveries not included in an existing drug lexicon for social media. We repeated this process for 98 drugs of abuse, of which 22 are widely-discussed drugs of abuse, building a lexicon of colloquial drug synonyms that can be used for pharmacovigilance on social media. © 2023 by the authors."
"A new class of cryptosystems called verifiable encryption (VE) that facilitates the verification of two plaintexts without decryption was proposed in our previous paper. The main contributions of our previous study include the following. (1) Certain cryptosystems such as the one-time pad belong to the VE class. (2) We constructed an authentication algorithm for unlocking local devices via a network that utilizes the property of VE. (3) As a result of implementing the VE-based authentication algorithm using the one-time pad, the encryption, verification, and decryption processing times are less than 1 ms even with a text length of 8192 bits. All the personal information used in the algorithm is protected by Shanon’s perfect secrecy. (4) The robustness of the algorithm against man-in-the-middle attacks and plaintext attacks was discussed. However, the discussion about the security of the algorithm was insufficient from the following two perspectives: (A) its robustness against other theoretical attacks such as ciphertext-only, known-plaintext, chosen-plaintext, adaptive chosen-plaintext, chosen-ciphertext, and adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks was not discussed; (B) a formal security analysis using security verification tools was not performed. In this paper, we analyze the security of the VE-based authentication algorithm by discussing its robustness against the above theoretical attacks and by validating the algorithm using a security verification tool. These security analyses, show that known attacks are ineffective against the algorithm. © 2023 by the authors."
"Artificial intelligence (AI) is the development of computer systems whereby machines can mimic human actions. This is increasingly used as an assistive tool to help clinicians diagnose and treat diseases. Periodontitis is one of the most common diseases worldwide, causing the destruction and loss of the supporting tissues of the teeth. This study aims to assess current literature describing the effect AI has on the diagnosis and epidemiology of this disease. Extensive searches were performed in April 2022, including studies where AI was employed as the independent variable in the assessment, diagnosis, or treatment of patients with periodontitis. A total of 401 articles were identified for abstract screening after duplicates were removed. In total, 293 texts were excluded, leaving 108 for full-text assessment with 50 included for final synthesis. A broad selection of articles was included, with the majority using visual imaging as the input data field, where the mean number of utilised images was 1666 (median 499). There has been a marked increase in the number of studies published in this field over the last decade. However, reporting outcomes remains heterogeneous because of the variety of statistical tests available for analysis. Efforts should be made to standardise methodologies and reporting in order to ensure that meaningful comparisons can be drawn. © 2023 by the authors."
"Limited research has evaluated the mental health effects during compounding disasters (e.g., a hurricane occurring during a pandemic), and few studies have examined post-disaster mental health with alternative data sources like crisis text lines. This study examined changes in crisis help-seeking for individuals in Louisiana, USA, before and after Hurricane Ida (2021), a storm that co-occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. An interrupted time series analysis and difference-in-difference analysis for single and multiple group comparisons were used to examine pre-and post-changes in crisis text volume (i.e., any crisis text, substance use, thoughts of suicide, stress/anxiety, and bereavement) among help-seeking individuals in communities that received US Federal Emergency Management Agency individual and public assistance following a presidential disaster declaration. Results showed a significant increase in crisis texts for any reason, thoughts of suicide, stress/anxiety, and bereavement in the four-week, three-month, and four-month post-impact period. Findings highlight the need for more mental health support for residents directly impacted by disasters like Hurricane Ida. © 2023 The Authors.

"In the last decade’s media discourse, particular Arab immigrant groups received the name ‘Arab clans’ and have been portrayed as criminal kinship networks irrespective of actual involvement in crime. We question how ‘Arab clans’ are categorized, criminalized, and racialized in the German media. To answer this question, we collected clan-related mainstream media articles published between 2010 and 2020. Our first-step quantitative topic modeling of ‘clan’ coverage (n = 23,893) shows that the discourse about ‘Arab clans’ is situated as the most racialized and criminalized vis-à-vis other ‘clan’ discourses and is channeled through three macro topics: law and order, family and kinship, and criminal groupness. Second, to explore the deeper meaning of the discourse about ‘Arab clans’ by juxtaposing corpus linguistics and novel narrative approaches to the discourse-historical approach, we qualitatively analyzed 97 text passages extracted with the keywords in context search (KWIC). Our analysis reveals three prevalent argumentative strategies (Arab clan immigration out of control, Arab clans as enclaves, policing Arab clans) embedded in a media narrative of ethnonational rebirth: a story of Germany’s present-day need (‘moral panic’) to police and repel the threats associated with ‘the Arab clan Other’ in order for a celebratory return to a nostalgically idealized pre-Arab-immigration social/moral order. © 2023 by the authors."
"The act of lying and its detection have raised interest in many fields, from the legal system to our daily lives. Considering that testimonies are commonly based on linguistic parameters, natural language processing, a research field concerned with programming computers to process and analyse natural language texts or speech, is a topic of interest on this front. This study aimed to examine the linguistic styles of simulated deception and true testimonies collected with the aim of studying witness memory. Study participants were asked to act as a witness of a crime by retelling the story they had just read. Cognitive interviewing techniques were used to collect testimony under two conditions: truth and simulated deception. A sample of 48 participants volunteered to participate in the study. Analyses of the linguistic indicators and content were carried out. Specifically, we performed a comparison of testimonies of the same participant by condition to analyse the variation between (i) lexical and (ii) linguistic features and (iii) content and speech characteristics (disfluencies) depending on the narrative condition. Concerning lexical properties, adjectives were the most-varying grammatical category between truthful and deceptive testimonies. Furthermore, in the linguistic analysis, we observed that truthful testimonies were generally longer than deceptive ones in terms of the number of words and sentences and also characterised by more articulated sentence structures, and these differences were also statistically significant. Regarding the analysis of the content, cognitive criteria (details) and admitting lack of memory were more present in truthful statements. By providing an objective measure, these results are of interest in developing NLP tools for assessing the credibility of testimonies in forensics. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: People with chronic illnesses have increased morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. The influence of a person’s serious and/or comorbid chronic illness on COVID-19 vaccine uptake is not well understood. Aim: To undertake an in-depth exploration of factors influencing COVID-19 vaccine uptake among those with various serious and/or chronic diseases in the Australian context, using secondary data analysis of a survey study. Methods: Adults with cancer, diabetes and multiple sclerosis (MS) were recruited from 10 Australian health services to undertake a cross-sectional online survey (30 June to 5 October 2021) about COVID-19 vaccine uptake, vaccine hesitancy, confidence and complacency and disease-related decision-making impact. Free-text responses were invited regarding thoughts and feelings about the interaction between the participant’s disease, COVID-19, and vaccination. Qualitative thematic analysis was undertaken using an iterative process and representative verbatim quotes were chosen to illustrate the themes. Results: Of 4683 survey responses (cancer 3560, diabetes 842, and MS 281), 1604 (34.3%) included free-text comments for qualitative analysis. Participants who provided these were significantly less likely to have received a COVID-19 vaccination than those who did not comment (72.4% and 86.2%, respectively). People with diabetes were significantly less likely to provide free-text comments than those with cancer or MS (29.0%, 35.1% and 39.9%, respectively). Four key themes were identified from qualitative analysis, which were similar across disease states: (1) having a chronic disease heightened perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of COVID-19; (2) perceived impact of vaccination on chronic disease management and disease-related safety; (3) uncertain benefits of COVID-19 vaccine; and (4) overwhelming information overload disempowering patients. Conclusions: This qualitative analysis highlights an additional layer of complexity related to COVID-19 vaccination decision making in people with underlying health conditions. Appreciation of higher susceptibility to severe COVID-19 outcomes appears to be weighed against uncertain impacts of the vaccine on the progression and management of the comorbid disease. Interactions by clinicians addressing individual factors may alleviate concerns and maximise vaccine uptake in people with significant underlying health conditions. © 2023 by the authors."
"The relationship between human rights and Islam is important in countries of the Arab world where religion plays a significant role in public debates and daily life. The topic is particularly relevant at a time of sharpening conflicts and polarization, when forms of government in the region, the current world order, and the legitimacy of international organizations are increasingly contested. Much of the scholarly work published in English on this topic draws on sources available in English. This review, therefore, aims to make a contribution to the field through analysis and discussion of academic papers published in Arabic. A search was made in Google Scholar in April 2022 which yielded 12 publications published in 2020 and 2021, after inclusion and exclusion criteria had been applied. These publications were analyzed drawing on the four framing categories. A summary is also given of the definitions, sources, and premises on which the arguments of the publications draw. The reviewed papers contrast the universal and divine foundation of Islamic human rights with the limitations of modern conceptualizations based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). The latter is described as emanating from Western hegemonistic aspirations and as detached from moral and spiritual values. The papers consequently argue that human rights would be guaranteed globally by generalizing a system of governance based on Shari’a law and the ideal of the Rightly Guided Caliphs. Little attention is given to human rights abuses observed in Muslim societies, diverse interpretations of Islamic source texts, or concrete measures to improve human rights protections in practice. Importantly, the arguments presented in these papers tend to reinforce a contemporary discourse that frames conflicting visions on human rights as a ‘clash of civilisations’ between ‘Islam’ and ‘the West’. © 2023 by the authors."
"The financial business process worldwide suffers from huge dependencies upon labor and written documents, thus making it tedious and time-consuming. In order to solve this problem, traditional robotic process automation (RPA) has recently been developed into a hyper-automation solution by combining computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) methods. These solutions are capable of image analysis, such as key information extraction and document classification. However, they could improve on text-rich document images and require much training data for processing multilingual documents. This study proposes a multimodal approach-based intelligent document processing framework that combines a pre-trained deep learning model with traditional RPA used in banks to automate business processes from real-world financial document images. The proposed framework can perform classification and key information extraction on a small amount of training data and analyze multilingual documents. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, extensive experiments were conducted using Korean financial document images. The experimental results show the superiority of the multimodal approach for understanding financial documents and demonstrate that adequate labeling can improve performance by up to about 15%. © 2023 by the authors."
"Based on Kevin Lynch’s cognitive method of urban image and Weibo’s review data, this study constructs a research framework with three modules as the core: city image structure, city image types, and cultural service evaluation. First, the geospatial information carried by comments is analyzed by GIS to obtain the image structure of the city; second, the picture data in the comments are divided into image types and the type ratio is calculated by the image semantic segmentation method based on deep full convolution neural network. Finally, the text data in the comments are extracted from the semantic word frequency analysis to evaluate the cultural service perception index words of the city image and combined with the analysis of the city image structure and the city image type so as to obtain the integrated comprehensive perception of the city image. The research shows that the introduction of big data and deep learning methods into city image research can make up for the shortcomings of traditional research samples, expand the dimension and breadth of urban cognition, reveal the social, cultural, and functional characteristics of the city, and is an important supplement to the five-element model of city image depicting the material form of the city. In addition, the results of the empirical study, taking Zhongshan City as an example, have implications for the realistic urban spatial planning, urban landscape design, and tourism industry layout of Zhongshan. © 2023 by the authors."
"Venous leg ulcer treatment is frequently discontinued in hospitals in contravention of national guidance, significantly affecting patient outcomes and increasing NHS costs. Aim: To identify, from the published literature, reasons for variable implementation. Method: Systematic review with narrative synthesis, including full papers in English with empirical qualitative data. Synonyms for venous leg ulcer, compression therapy and secondary care were searched across a range of health-related databases. The Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) checklist determined study quality, and meta-ethnography was used for data synthesis. Results: 7040 titles and abstracts and 41 full-text papers were screened with four papers selected. Three key themes were generated: educational needs surrounding implementation of compression therapy, patient factors regarding adherence and organisational resources including availability of appropriate equipment and trained staff. Conclusion: Barriers at the ward level were identified. There is a need to better understand why hospitals are not addressing them. © 2023 MA Healthcare Ltd. All rights reserved."
"Tour planning has become both challenging and time-consuming due to the huge amount of information available online and the variety of options to choose from. This is more so as each traveler has unique set of interests and location preferences in addition to other tour-based constraints such as vaccination status and pandemic travel restrictions. Several travel planning companies and agencies have emerged with more sophisticated online services to capitalize on global tourism effectively by using technology for making suitable recommendations to travel seekers. However, such systems predominantly adopt a destination-based recommendation approach and often come as bundled packages with limited customization options for incorporating each traveler’s preferences. To address these limitations, “thematic travel planning” has emerged as a recent alternative with researchers adopting text-based data mining for achieving value-added online tourism services. Understanding the need for a more holistic theme approach in this domain, our aim is to propose an augmented model to integrate analytics of a variety of big data (both static and dynamic). Our unique inclusive model covers text mining and data mining of destination images, reviews on tourist activities, weather forecasts, and recent events via social media for generating more user-centric and location-based thematic recommendations efficiently. In this paper, we describe an implementation of our proposed inclusive hybrid recommendation model that uses data of multimodal ranking of user preferences. Furthermore, in this study, we present an experimental evaluation of our model’s effectiveness. We present the details of our improvised model that employs various statistical and machine learning techniques on existing data available online, such as travel forums and social media reviews in order to arrive at the most relevant and suitable travel recommendations. Our hybrid recommender built using various Spark models such as naïve Bayes classifier, trigonometric functions, deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN), time series, and NLP with sentiment scores using AFINN (sentiment analysis developed by Finn Årup Nielsen) shows promising results in the directions of benefit for an individual model’s complementary advantages. Overall, our proposed hybrid recommendation algorithm serves as an active learner of user preferences and ranking by collecting explicit information via the system and uses such rich information to make personalized augmented recommendations according to the unique preferences of travelers. © 2023 by the authors."
"Enzyme inhibitors are frequently used to treat viral illnesses. Protease inhibitors are a promising class for combating novel and life-threatening viral infections. This research aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir monotherapy or lopinavir/ritonavir plus interferon for the treatment of COVID-19. The PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for English articles with full texts available online. ReviewManager software was used to conduct a meta-analysis, subgroup analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Following the creation of the protocol, the collected sources were sorted into categories and evaluated for quality. Risk and hazard ratios and the random effects model were implemented, with statistical heterogeneity assigned using the Higgins I2 statistic. Lopinavir/ritonavir, with or without interferon, was associated with a nonsignificant higher mortality rate (odds ratio [OR] 1.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.95 to 1.761; p = 0.1), as was clinical improvement (OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.8 to 1.84; p = 0.36). The difference in the length of hospital stay was in favor of the control group but statistically insignificant (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.07; 95% CI −0.44 to 0.57; p = 0.79). The pooled data showed that lopinavir/ritonavir, with or without interferon, was associated with a significantly higher number of adverse events than placebo (OR 1.2; 95% CI 1.09 to 2.34; p = 0.02). Serious adverse events were insignificantly increased in the treated group over the control group (OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.96 to 2.12; p = 0.08). In the subgroup analysis, it was found that interferon used with lopinavir/ritonavir did not have a statistically significant effect on mortality rates (OR 1.75; 95% CI 0.87 to 3.55; p = 0.37), adverse effects (OR 1.20; 95% CI 0.75 to 1.91; p = 0.27), or serious adverse effects (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.96; p = 0.33). Treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir alone or in combination with interferon for COVID-19 did not significantly outperform placebo in this study. Large randomized clinical trials are required to evaluate lopinavir/ritonavir in conjunction with interferon for the treatment of COVID-19. Such studies would benefit greatly from being conducted in a double-blind fashion at multiple locations. © 2023 by the authors."
"A figurative language expression known as sarcasm implies the complete contrast of what is being stated with what is meant, with the latter usually being rather or extremely offensive, meant to offend or humiliate someone. In routine conversations on social media websites, sarcasm is frequently utilized. Sentiment analysis procedures are prone to errors because sarcasm can change a statement’s meaning. Analytic accuracy apprehension has increased as automatic social networking analysis tools have grown. According to preliminary studies, the accuracy of computerized sentiment analysis has been dramatically decreased by sarcastic remarks alone. Sarcastic expressions also affect automatic false news identification and cause false positives. Because sarcastic comments are inherently ambiguous, identifying sarcasm may be difficult. Different individual NLP strategies have been proposed in the past. However, each methodology has text contexts and vicinity restrictions. The methods are unable to manage various kinds of content. This study suggests a unique ensemble approach based on text embedding that includes fuzzy evolutionary logic at the top layer. This approach involves applying fuzzy logic to ensemble embeddings from the Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT models before making the final classification. The three models’ weights assigned to the probability are used to categorize objects using the fuzzy layer. The suggested model was validated on the following social media datasets: the Headlines dataset, the “Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus” (SARC), and the Twitter app dataset. Accuracies of 90.81%, 85.38%, and 86.80%, respectively, were achieved. The accuracy metrics were more accurate than those of earlier state-of-the-art models. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Mindfulness-based interventions have been shown to be efficacious for reducing psychological distress and mental health symptoms and promoting well-being, including during pregnancy and postpartum. There is promising, though limited, evidence showing that interventions that focus on improving the mother-infant relationship are associated with improvements in both the mother-infant relationship and maternal mental health symptoms. The current study examines the effects of a prenatal mindfulness-based, reflective intervention designed to enhance maternal-fetal bonding on pregnancy-related distress and prenatal depressive symptoms. Methods: Out of a larger sample of 130 pregnant women in their second trimester, 15 women were recruited to participate in a 2-week long mindfulness-based, reflective intervention with daily short (<5-minute) activities. Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to examine associations between the intervention and pregnancy-related distress and depression during the third trimester of pregnancy, controlling for race, age, education, union status, and first trimester depressive symptoms. Results: Results indicate that women who participated in the intervention during their second trimester reported lower pregnancy-related distress in their third trimester but no differences in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: A brief, mindfulness-based intervention delivered during pregnancy via cellphone texts can be a useful tool to reduce maternal distress related to pregnancy. Additional reflective exercises that address mood and global stress, as well as increasing the amount and/or frequency of the intervention, may be important for promoting maternal mental health more globally. © Lucia Ciciolla et al., 2023;"
"The emergency response ability of police officers is a critical component of their career, and is also an important support for public security. However, few researchers have focused on the factors that influence emergency response ability, especially in the group of novice policemen. On the other hand, as the popular way to train emergency response ability, case-based instruction (CBI) generates various types of data, especially valuable text data; however, such text data is always ignored because of the lack of effective analysis methods. Therefore, this study employed automatic semantic analysis and hierarchical linear regression models to investigate the factors influencing the emergency response ability of novice policemen in the process of CBI. Results indicated that, among personal differences, prior knowledge, and basic professional skills, the latter showed stronger predictive validity than the others. In particular, information processing and judgment, command and decision, and order maintenance were the main indicators. This study also illustrated that automatic semantic analysis can effectively identify deep value from semantic data, which will support stakeholders to design strategies, make decisions, conduct evaluations in training and instructions, and ultimately help sustainable development in human careers. © 2023 by the authors."
"The objective of this systematic review was to analyze the recently published literature on the Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) and integrate the insights it articulates on big data management algorithms, deep learning-based object detection technologies, and geospatial simulation and sensor fusion tools. The research problems were whether computer vision techniques, geospatial data mining, simulation-based digital twins, and real-time monitoring technology optimize remote sensing robots. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were leveraged by a Shiny app to obtain the flow diagram comprising evidence-based collected and managed data (the search results and screening procedures). Throughout January and July 2022, a quantitative literature review of ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases was performed, with search terms comprising “Internet of Robotic Things” + “big data management algorithms”, “deep learning-based object detection technologies”, and “geospatial simulation and sensor fusion tools”. As the analyzed research was published between 2017 and 2022, only 379 sources fulfilled the eligibility standards. A total of 105, chiefly empirical, sources have been selected after removing full-text papers that were out of scope, did not have sufficient details, or had limited rigor For screening and quality evaluation so as to attain sound outcomes and correlations, we deployed AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews), AXIS (Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies), MMAT (Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool), and ROBIS (to assess bias risk in systematic reviews). Dimensions was leveraged as regards initial bibliometric mapping (data visualization) and VOSviewer was harnessed in terms of layout algorithms. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: ""Breast awareness""is a recommendation that women understand the symptoms of breast cancer and become familiar with the usual look and feel of their breasts. It is recommended for women of all ages in breast cancer screening guidelines around the world. The objective of this study was to assess the evidence for breast awareness by investigating its effect on breast cancer outcomes in women of pre-mammographic-screening age (under age 40), at average risk of breast cancer. Methods: A systematic review was performed using PRISMA methodology. Following the search, abstracts and full-text articles were assessed against eligibility criteria. Data were extracted into evidence tables, risk of bias was assessed, narrative synthesis was performed, and results were described. Eligible studies were original research studies assessing the impact of breast awareness on cancer outcomes (such as stage at diagnosis or survival) in women ≤40. Medline, PubMed, and Cochrane Library were searched. Results: After screening the 6,204 abstracts identified in the search, no studies meeting all eligibility criteria were found. Two partially eligible studies were identified. These met the intervention and outcomes criteria but included mixed-age cohorts that included but were not limited to women ≤40. These studies provided low-level (Level IV) evidence of moderate quality that there is some benefit (earlier stage at diagnosis and/or improved survival) of breast awareness in a mixed-age cohort that included some younger women. Conclusions: No studies evaluating the impact of breast awareness exclusively in young women were identified. Limited evidence of benefit of breast awareness was found. Guidelines that recommend breast awareness should be reviewed and qualified with an explanation that the evidence of benefit is weak. Women have limited screening options available to them for the early detection of breast cancer until they reach mammographic screening age.

"Purpose: Crowdfunding campaigns are a way to secure capital for organizations, entrepreneurs, artists, and more. Little research has focused on stylistic aspects of text associated with successful campaigns. Method: We used corpus analysis to analyze the text of 312,529 Kickstarter campaigns. We used a novel scoring method to compute how often verbs and words surrounding verbs were associated with success or failure. We then identified prominent stylistic aspects of text that were often included in successful and unsuccessful campaigns. Results: Stylistic elements strongly associated with success included using we instead of I, using contractions instead of full forms of verbs, inviting the reader to join the project and receive rewards, and projecting confidence via will instead of the more uncertain would. Conclusion: Stylistic findings interact. Specifically, using we and contractions together indicates outcomes strongly associated with success. Broadly, each of the findings point toward creators of campaigns attempting to build trust in the readers. The elements of this emergent style work together toward a goal of producing campaign text that describes a campaign readers accept and trust as likely to succeed. © 2023, Society for Technical Communication.

"In modern biology and medicine, drug-drug similarity is a major task with various applications in pharmaceutical drug development. Various direct and indirect sources of evidence obtained from drug-centric data such as side effects, drug interactions, biological targets, and chemical structures are used in the current methods to measure the level of drug-drug similarity. This paper proposes a computational method to measure drug-drug similarity using a novel source of evidence that is obtained from patient-centric data. More specifically, patients’ narration of their thoughts, opinions, and experience with drugs in social media are explored as a potential source to compute drug-drug similarity. Online healthcare communities were used to extract a dataset of patients’ reviews on anti-epileptic drugs. The collected dataset is preprocessed through Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and four text similarity methods are applied to measure the similarities among them. The obtained similarities are then used to generate drug-drug similarity-based ranking matrices which are analyzed through Pearson correlation, to answer questions related to the overall drug-drug similarity and the accuracy of the four similarity measures. To evaluate the obtained drug-drug similarities, they are compared with the corresponding ground-truth similarities obtained from DrugSimDB, a well-known drug-drug similarity tool that is based on drug-centric data. The results provide evidence on the feasibility of patient-centric data from social media as a novel source for computing drug-drug similarity. © 2023 by the author."
"Background: Prediabetes has become a worldwide health problem. Multiple clinical trials have been conducted to determine the potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation in preventing the conversion to diabetes, but the results are inconsistent. The aims of this study were to evaluate the current knowledge and to suggest recommendations for researchers on designing future trials regarding that matter. Methods: Four databases were searched for randomized control trials from the last 10 years about vitamin D and insulin resistance. The systematic electronic literature search identified 2645 studies, of which thirty-eight qualified for full-text reading and discussion. Finally, eight trials were included. Results: Final results of seven trials reported that supplementation of vitamin D does not reduce insulin resistance nor reduces the risk of diabetes mellitus type 2 development in prediabetes. Only one trial showed improvements in fasting glucose and HOMA-IR. Conclusions: Due to the great variation and biases in study designs, an unambiguous interpretation of the results is not possible. To eliminate those vulnerabilities in the future, we made certain suggestions for study design. Long-term and well-designed studies are still required. © 2023 by the authors."
"The number of homeless people at airports has increased in recent years. As airports are safe, transit-accessible, convenient, and climate-controlled facilities with food and amenities, these places are attractive to homeless people who need a safe and secure place to stay. The main struggle of airports in this regard is maintaining a balance between customers, who are mostly the traveling public, and dealing with homeless people delicately. Moreover, because of their poverty and insufficient or no access to healthcare, these people suffer from physical and mental issues. With the COVID-19 pandemic, this problem became more critical. Many news media outlets started to report on homelessness at airports. News-framing impacts have some contribution in the context of this issue. However, the impact of news coverage on ‘‘airport and homelessness’’ has not yet been studied. News-framing effects have been identified in the context of tourist destinations. Although many studies have explored homelessness and transit, this issue at airports has not been well studied. This study provides a brief overview of the issue of homelessness in the transportation domain, including transit and aviation. Additionally, this study collected news articles related to ‘‘airport and homelessness’’ (71 articles) both during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020–July 21, 2021) and before the pandemic (before March 1, 2020). These news articles contain around 50,000 words. As the data is unsupervised in nature, a text network analysis was performed to determine the latent information from these textual contents. The findings of this study can shed some light on this scientifically unexplored but widely discussed issue. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2022."
"The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic literature review with a subsequent meta-analysis on the technical complications and failures of removable partial denture (RPD) therapy in the moderately reduced dentition. A systematic literature search of established medical databases, last updated 06/2022, was conducted. RCTs and prospective and retrospective studies were included that had information on technical complications and failures of RPDs, at least 15 participants, an observation period of at least two years and a drop-out rate of less than 25%. Publications were selected on the title, abstract and full-text level by at least three of the participating authors. The evidence of the included studies was classified using the GRADE system. The bias risk was determined using the RoB2 tool and the ROBINS-I tool. Of 19,592 initial hits, 43 publications were included. Predominantly, retention of the prosthesis, retention loss of anchor crowns (decementations), fractures/repairs of frameworks, denture teeth, veneering or acrylic bases, and a need for relining were reported depending on prosthesis type and observation time. Focusing on technical complications and failures, only very heterogeneous data were found and publications with the highest quality level according to GRADE were scarce. Whenever possible, data on technical complications and failures should be reported separately when referencing the tooth, the prosthesis and the patient for comparability. Prostheses with differing anchorage types should be analyzed in different groups, as the respective complications and failures differ. A precise description of the kinds of complications and failures, as well as of the resulting follow-up treatment measures, should be given. © 2023 by the authors."
"Introduction: Evidence on the use of brachytherapy in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) is sparse. Therapy regimens are determined more by local interdisciplinary tumor conferences than by standardized protocols. Patient-specific factors complicate the standardized application of therapy protocols. The individuality of the treatment makes it difficult to compare results. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted, whereby the literature from a period of almost 44 years (1977–2021) was graded and included in this systematic review. For this purpose, PubMed was used as the primary database. Search string included “soft-tissue sarcoma”, “brachytherapy”, and “extremity.” Four independent researchers reviewed the literature. Only full-text articles written in English or German were included. Results: Of the 175 identified studies, 70 were eligible for analysis based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The key points to compare were local complications, recurrence rate and correlation with margins of resection, and the use of brachytherapy regarding tumor grading. Conclusion: Brachytherapy represents an important subset of radiotherapy techniques used in STSs, whose indications and applications are constantly evolving, and for which a local control rate of 50% to 96% has been reported as monotherapy, depending on risk factors. However, the best benefit is seen in the combination of further resection and brachytherapy, and most authors at many other centers agree with this treatment strategy. © 2023 by the authors."
"Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by the monkeypox virus. This disease was considered eradicated in 1980 and was believed to affect rodents and not humans. However, recent years have seen a massive outbreak of monkeypox in humans, setting off worldwide alerts from health agencies. As of September 2022, the number of confirmed cases in Peru had reached 1964. Although most monkeypox patients have been discharged, we cannot neglect the monitoring of the population with respect to the monkeypox virus. Lately, the population has started to express their feelings and opinions through social media, specifically Twitter, as it is the most used social medium and is an ideal space to gather what people think about the monkeypox virus. The information imparted through this medium can be in different formats, such as text, videos, images, audio, etc. The objective of this work is to analyze the positive, negative, and neutral feelings of people who publish their opinions on Twitter with the hashtag #Monkeypox. To find out what people think about this disease, a hybrid-based model architecture built on CNN and LSTM was used to determine the prediction accuracy. The prediction result obtained from the total monkeypox data was 83% accurate. Other performance metrics were also used to evaluate the model, such as specificity, recall level, and F1 score, representing 99%, 85%, and 88%, respectively. The results also showed the polarity of feelings through the CNN-LSTM confusion matrix, where 45.42% of people expressed neither positive nor negative opinions, while 19.45% expressed negative and fearful feelings about this infectious disease. The results of this work contribute to raising public awareness about the monkeypox virus. © 2023 by the authors."
"Starting from the idea of the city as a palimpsest in which the traces of generations are superimposed, the text that follows reflects on the role of landscape and heritage as repositories of collective memory. To do this, after exposing the problem of the chosen case study (the patrimonial legacy of mining in Melilla), it justifies its suitability based on a specific strategic and conceptual framework, placing its starting point in contemporary landscape policies and heritage. Later, it presents a methodology for the analysis of subjective perception, which is complemented with historical and spatial analyses. The objective of this method is to measure how legible a heritage landscape is for the population. One of its main contributions is the transformation of the data from a survey into a cartography that shows the mental model of perception of this landscape for each population group analyzed. Its aim is to work as a diagnostic tool for landscape problems from perception analysis, which can be useful as a basis for proposing specific actions aimed at strengthening the relationship between heritage and its context. © 2023, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

"Urban regeneration by participatory methods is being discussed in many parts of the world, but conflicts between stakeholders emerge as a major challenge. In order to address this problem, a new approach to urban regeneration has been attempted in Korea. By targeting towns with university campuses, this project encourages active participation from university students as well as local residents. As a result of COVID-19 restrictions, the project adopted an online-based communication strategy. First, the online data was collected; second, the data for each participant was classified through data refinement; and third, the data analysis and data visualization were carried out at each stage using program R. The results revealed that the stakeholders exhibited different perceptions about the process, indicating a potential benefit of distinct role division for the success of the multiparty project. The significance of this study lies in the fact that it analyzes participants’ perceptions of urban regeneration using a text-mining process. The results of the study can serve as the basis for minimizing conflict and planning effective urban regeneration. © 2023 by the authors."
"Melasma is a challenging chronic skin condition associated with hyperpigmentation and unknown aetiology. This scoping review maps evidence of available treatments and their effectiveness in darker skin types. A comprehensive, systematic online search was conducted in Scopus, PubMed, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science Core Collection. All eligible titles were exported to an EndNote20 library (Clarivate analytics, US). Thematic content analysis was performed to summarise data on current melasma treatments for darker skin types. The quality of included articles was appraised using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) 2018 version. A total of 2863 articles were retrieved from the databases, and 10 met the eligibility criteria following abstract and full-text screening. Our findings demonstrate that topical treatments, chemical peels, lasers, and tranexamic acid are common treatment modalities used in darker skin types. Although these treatments may be effective in the short term, they bring about undesirable side effects and sometimes worsen or result in reoccurrences of melasma. Based on the evidence mapped, current treatment modalities are not suitable for darker skin types. There are very few studies conducted on individuals of African descent. Further research is necessary to investigate treatment interventions that may be user-friendly when dealing with darker skin types. © 2023 by the authors."
"Objective School nurses are engaging worldwide to promote and protect children's health. Many researchers who examined the effectiveness of the school nurse criticized the inadequate methodology employed in many of the studies. We therefore carried out an evaluation on the effectiveness of school nurses based on a rigorous methodological approach. Methods In this overview of reviews we performed an electronic databank search and global research results on the effectiveness of school nurses were sought. We identified 1,494 records through database search. Abstracts and full texts were screened and summarized using the dual control principle. We summarized the aspects of quality criteria as well as the significance of the effectiveness of the school nurse. In the first step, k = 16 systematic reviews were summarized and evaluated following the AMSTAR-2 guidelines. In a second step, j = 357 primary studies included in these k = 16 reviews were summarized and assessed following the GRADE guidelines. Results Research results on the effectiveness of school nurses show that school nurses play a key role in improving the health of children with asthma (j = 6) and diabetes (j = 2), results on combating obesity are less certain (j = 6). The quality of identified reviews is mostly very low with only six studies of medium quality, of which one identified as a meta-analysis. A total of j = 289 primary studies were identified. Approximately 25% (j = 74) of identified primary studies were either randomized controlled trials (RCT) or observational studies, of which roughly 20% (j = 16) had a low risk of bias. Studies with physiological variables such as blood glucose or asthma labeling led to higher quality results. Conclusion This paper represents an initial contribution and recommends further evaluation of the effectiveness of school nurses, particularly in the areas of mental health or children from low socioeconomic backgrounds. The general lack of quality standards in school nursing research should be integrated into the scientific discourse of school nursing researchers to provide robust evidence for policy planners and researchers.  © 2023 Pawils et al.

"The aim of the present systematic review is to summarize current knowledge regarding the analysis of biomarkers extracted from peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) as predictors of peri-implant bone loss (BL). An electronic search was conducted on three databases, PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar, to find clinical trials published until 1 December 2022 suitable to answer the following focused question: in patients with dental implants, are biomarkers harvested from PICF predictive of peri-implant BL? The initial search yielded a total of 158 entries. After a full-text review and application of the eligibility criteria, the final selection consisted of nine articles. The risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal tools (JBI). According to the present systematic review, some inflammatory biomarkers harvested from PICF (collagenase-2, collagenase-3, ALP, EA, gelatinase b, NTx, procalcitonin, IL-1β, and several miRNAs) seem to be correlated with peri-implant BL and may assist in the early diagnosis of pathological BL, that characterizes peri-implantitis. MiRNA expression demonstrated a predictive potential of peri-implant BL that could be useful for host-targeted preventive and therapeutic purposes. PICF sampling may represent a promising, noninvasive, and repeatable form of liquid biopsy in implant dentistry. © 2023 by the authors."
"Biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) is a preliminary task for many other tasks, e.g., relation extraction and semantic search. Extracting the text of interest from biomedical documents becomes more demanding as the availability of online data is increasing. Deep learning models have been adopted for biomedical named entity recognition (BioNER) as deep learning has been found very successful in many other tasks. Nevertheless, the complex structure of biomedical text data is still a challenging aspect for deep learning models. Limited annotated biomedical text data make it more difficult to train deep learning models with millions of trainable parameters. The single-task model, which focuses on learning a specific task, has issues in learning complex feature representations from a limited quantity of annotated data. Moreover, manually constructing annotated data is a time-consuming job. It is, therefore, vital to exploit other efficient ways to train deep learning models on the available annotated data. This work enhances the performance of the BioNER task by taking advantage of various knowledge transfer techniques: multitask learning and transfer learning. This work presents two multitask models (MTMs), which learn shared features and task-specific features by implementing the shared and task-specific layers. In addition, the presented trained MTM is also fine-tuned for each specific dataset to tailor it from a general features representation to a specialized features representation. The presented empirical results and statistical analysis from this work illustrate that the proposed techniques enhance significantly the performance of the corresponding single-task model (STM). © 2023 by the authors."
"Interest influences adults’ and young learners’ learning in formal and informal contexts. Although interest and interest development frameworks have been used in research on student-learning, they are not used in teacher-focused research, especially as “outcomes” of teacher professional development (PD) activities. In this study, we used interest development as the outcome of PD in computer science (CS) and investigated the factors that influenced teachers’ (n = 5) interest development toward CS using various data sources and analysis methods. We found that interest development is (a) varied, (b) influenced by self-relation, knowledge, and affect, (c) associated with reengagement with PD activities, and (d) it can be captured using computational text analysis methods and online log data. © 2023 by the authors."
"Community portraits can deeply explore the characteristics of community structures and describe the personalized knowledge needs of community users, which is of great practical significance for improving community recommendation services, as well as the accuracy of resource push. The current community portraits generally have the problems of weak perception of interest characteristics and low degree of integration of topic information. To resolve this problem, the reader community portrait method based on the thematic and timeliness characteristics of interest labels (UIT) is proposed. First, community opinion leaders are identified based on multi-feature calculations, and then the topic features of their texts are identified based on the LDA topic model. On this basis, a semantic mapping including “reader community-opinion leader-text content” was established. Second, the readers' interest similarity of the labels was dynamically updated, and two kinds of tag parameters were integrated, namely, the intensity of interest labels and the stability of interest labels. Finally, the similarity distance between the opinion leader and the topic of interest was calculated to obtain the dynamic interest set of the opinion leaders. Experimental analysis was conducted on real data from the Douban reading community. The experimental results show that the UIT has the highest average F value (0.551) compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, which indicates that the UIT has better performance in the smooth time dimension. © 2023 KIPS"
"Background and Aims: Alteration in humans' gut microbiota was reported in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The gut and upper respiratory tract (URT) microbiota harbor a dynamic and complex population of microorganisms and have strong interaction with host immune system homeostasis. However, our knowledge about microbiota and its association with SARS-CoV-2 is still limited. We aimed to systematically review the effects of gut microbiota on the SARS-CoV-2 infection and its severity and the impact that SARS-CoV-2 could have on the gut microbiota. Methods: We searched the keywords in the online databases of Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane on December 31, 2021. After duplicate removal, we performed the screening process in two stages; title/abstract and then full-text screening. The data of the eligible studies were extracted into a pre-designed word table. This study adhered to the PRISMA checklist and Newcastle−Ottawa Scale Bias Assessment tool. Results: Sixty-three publications were included in this review. Our study shows that among COVID-19 patients, particularly moderate to severe cases, the gut and lung microbiota was different compared to healthy individuals. In addition, the severity, and viral load of COVID-19 disease would probably also be influenced by the gut, and lung microbiota's composition. Conclusion: Our study concludes that there was a significant difference in the composition of the URT, and gut microbiota in COVID-19 patients compared to the general healthy individuals, with an increase in opportunistic pathogens. Further, research is needed to investigate the probable bidirectional association of COVID-19 and human microbiome. © 2023 The Authors. Health Science Reports published by Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Digital technologies are being increasingly utilized in healthcare to provide pertinent and timely information for primary prevention, such as vaccination. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review to describe and assess current digital health interventions to promote HPV vaccination among adolescents and parents of adolescents, and to recommend directions for future interventions of this kind. Using appropriate medical subject headings and keywords, we searched multiple databases to identify relevant studies published in English between 1 January 2017 and 31 July 2022. We screened and selected eligible studies for inclusion in the final analysis. We reviewed a total of 24 studies, which included interventions using text messages (4), mobile apps (4), social media and websites (8), digital games (4), and videos (4). The interventions generally improved determinants of HPV vaccination, such as HPV-related knowledge, vaccine-related conversations, and vaccination intentions. In particular, text message and social media interventions targeted improved vaccine uptake behaviors, but little meaningful change was observed. In conclusion, digital health interventions can cost-effectively provide education about HPV vaccination, offer interactive environments to alleviate parental vaccine hesitancy, and ultimately help adolescents engage in HPV vaccine uptake. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the most common sexually transmitted viral infection in the world. HPV vaccination adherence rates in men are generally lower than in women. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess adherence to HPV vaccination in young working-age males (18–30 years old). Methods: A systematic review was performed using three databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Results: After duplicate removal, the initial search resulted in 478 eligible papers. With the exclusion of 425 papers after screening the abstracts, full texts of 53 articles were reviewed. Subsequently, 45 were excluded. Among the eight studies included, four (50%) examined the vaccination adherence in young adults through data registered in nationwide insurance or private companies’ databases, three (37.5%) in young adults in different settings through data collected from surveys and questionnaires, and one (12.5%) an HPV vaccination campaign in a family medicine residency practice. Conclusion: Adherence to HPV vaccination in men of working age (18–30 years) does not appear to be adequate (pooled prevalence 11%). In order to achieve a higher level of compliance, it is important to place an emphasis on vaccination campaigns in schools as well as in the workplace, after consultation with and approval from local, regional, and federal public health agencies. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Workplace-based assessment (WBA) is a key assessment strategy in competency-based medical education. However, its full potential has not been actualized secondary to concerns with reliability, validity, and accuracy. Frame of reference training (FORT), a rater training technique that helps assessors distinguish between learner performance levels, can improve the accuracy and reliability of WBA, but the effect size is variable. Understanding FORT benefits and challenges help improve this rater training technique. Objective: To explore faculty's perceptions of the benefits and challenges associated with FORT. Methods: Subjects were internal medicine and family medicine physicians (n=41) who participated in a rater training intervention in 2018 consisting of in-person FORT followed by asynchronous online spaced learning. We assessed participants' perceptions of FORT in post-workshop focus groups and an end-of-study survey. Focus groups and survey free text responses were coded using thematic analysis. Results: All subjects participated in 1 of 4 focus groups and completed the survey. Four benefits of FORT were identified: (1) opportunity to apply skills frameworks via deliberate practice; (2) demonstration of the importance of certain evidence-based clinical skills; (3) practice that improved the ability to discriminate between resident skill levels; and (4) highlighting the importance of direct observation and the dangers using proxy information in assessment. Challenges included time constraints and task repetitiveness. Conclusions: Participants believe that FORT training serves multiple purposes, including helping them distinguish between learner skill levels while demonstrating the impact of evidence-based clinical skills and the importance of direct observation."
"Physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle are risk factors for excess weight and obesity in childhood. It is, therefore, necessary to adopt strategies which can modify these behaviors during childhood, the age at which habits are formed. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an educational intervention using digital media and face-to-face activities involving children, parents, and the school community on the level of physical activity and sedentary behavior among schoolchildren. This was a secondary analysis of data obtained from a community trial in which students from four primary schools in Mexico City participated. Two schools were assigned to the intervention group (IG) and two to the control group (CG). The intervention lasted 12 months and included a face-to-face component, which involved sessions and workshops for parents and children, as well as visual material for children and a distance component utilizing electronic means (web portal and text messages to mobile phones) for parents. Anthropometric measurements were taken and information was collected on moderate to vigorous physical activity performed by the children and on the time that the schoolchildren spent in front of screens at the beginning of the study and at 6 and 12 months. Information on 201 children from the IG and 167 children from the CG was included in the analysis. At 12 months, the IG showed a mean decrease of 33.4 min/d [95% CI: −53.5 to −13.3] in screen time, while the CG showed an increase of 12.5 min/d [CI 95%: −10.5 to 35.6], p = 0.003. After 12 months of follow-up, applying this educational intervention reduced the time that schoolchildren spent in front of screens. Educational intervention is a feasible and accessible strategy for promoting changes in sedentary behaviors in the school-age population. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background Approximately seven to nine percent of couples of reproductive age do not get pregnant despite regular and unprotected sexual intercourse. Various psychosocial interventions for women and men with fertility disorders are repeatedly found in the literature. The effects of these interventions on outcomes such as anxiety and depression, as well as on the probability of pregnancy, do not currently allow for reliable generalisable statements. This review includes studies published since 2015 performing a method-critical evaluation of the studies. Furthermore, we suggest how interventions could be implemented in the future to improve anxiety, depression, and pregnancy rates. Method The project was registered with Prospero (CRD42021242683 13 April 2021). The literature search was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Six databases were searched and 479 potential studies were discovered. After reviewing the full texts, ten studies were included for the synthesis. Not all studies reported the three outcomes: four studies each for depression, three for anxiety and nine studies for pregnancy rates were included in the meta-analysis, which was conducted using the Comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) software. Results Psychosocial interventions do not significantly change women’s anxiety (Hedges’ g -0,006; CI: -0,667 to 0,655; p = 0,985), but they have a significant impact on depression in infertile women (Hedges’ g -0,893; CI: -1,644 to -0,145; p = 0,026). Implementations of psychosocial interventions during assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment do not increase pregnancy rates (odds ratio 1,337; 95% CI 0,983 to 1,820; p = 0,064). The methodological critical evaluation indicates heterogeneous study design and samples. The results of the studies were determined with different methods and make comparability difficult. All these factors do not allow for a uniform conclusion. Methodological critical evaluation Study design (duration and timing of intervention, type of intervention, type of data collection) and samples (age of women, reason for infertility, duration of infertility) are very heterogeneous. The results of the studies were determined with different methods and make comparability difficult. All these factors do not allow for a uniform conclusion. Conclusion In order to be able to better compare psychosocial interventions and their influence on ART treatment and thus also to achieve valid results, a standardised procedure to the mentioned factors is necessary. © 2023 Kremer et al.

"Background: Obesity has become a public health problem in our society and is associated with many diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, dyslipidemia, respiratory diseases, and cancer. Several studies relate weight loss in obese patients to improved anthropometric measurements and cardiometabolic risk. The objective of our study was to evaluate anthropometric changes, analytical parameters, insulin resistance, fatty liver, and metabolic scales, after a personalized weight loss program, through dietary advice to increase adherence to the Mediterranean diet and a motivational booster via mobile SMS messaging. Methods: Intervention study on a sample of 1964 workers, in which different anthropometric parameters were evaluated before and after dietary intervention: the metabolic score of insulin resistance; non-alcoholic fatty liver disease using different scales; metabolic syndrome; atherogenic dyslipidemia; and the cardiometabolic index. A descriptive analysis of the categorical variables was performed, by calculating the frequency and distribution of the responses for each one. For quantitative variables, the mean and standard deviation were calculated, since they followed a normal distribution. Bivariate association analysis was performed by applying the chi-squared test (corrected by Fisher’s exact statistic when conditions required it) and Student’s t-test for independent samples (for comparison of means). Results: The population subjected to the Mediterranean diet improved in all the variables evaluated at 12 months of follow-up and compliance with the diet. Conclusions: Dietary advice on a Mediterranean diet and its reinforcement with reminder messages through the use of mobile phones may be useful to improve the parameters evaluated in this study and reduce the cardiometabolic risk of patients. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background Communicable diseases pose a severe threat to public health and economic growth. The traditional methods that are used for public health surveillance, however, involve many drawbacks, such as being labor intensive to operate and resulting in a lag between data collection and reporting. To effectively address the limitations of these traditional methods and to mitigate the adverse effects of these diseases, a proactive and real-time public health surveillance system is needed. Previous studies have indicated the usefulness of performing text mining on social media. Objective To conduct a systematic review of the literature that used textual content published to social media for the purpose of the surveillance and prediction of communicable diseases. Methodology Broad search queries were formulated and performed in four databases. Both journal articles and conference materials were included. The quality of the studies, operationalized as reliability and validity, was assessed. This qualitative systematic review was guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results Twenty-three publications were included in this systematic review. All studies reported positive results for using textual social media content to surveille communicable diseases. Most studies used Twitter as a source for these data. Influenza was studied most frequently, while other communicable diseases received far less attention. Journal articles had a higher quality (reliability and validity) than conference papers. However, studies often failed to provide important information about procedures and implementation. Conclusion Text mining of health-related content published on social media can serve as a novel and powerful tool for the automated, real-time, and remote monitoring of public health and for the surveillance and prediction of communicable diseases in particular. This tool can address limitations related to traditional surveillance methods, and it has the potential to supplement traditional methods for public health surveillance. © 2023 Pilipiec et al.

"The paper deals with the analysis of conversation transcriptions between customers and agents in a call center of a customer care service. The objective is to support the analysis of text transcription of human-to-human conversations, to obtain reports on customer problems and complaints, and on the way an agent has solved them. The aim is to provide customer care service with a high level of efficiency and user satisfaction. To this aim, topic modeling is considered since it facilitates insightful analysis from large documents and datasets, such as a summarization of the main topics and topic characteristics. This paper presents a performance comparison of four topic modeling algorithms: (i) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA); (ii) Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF); (iii) Neural-ProdLDA (Neural LDA) and Contextualized Topic Models (CTM). The comparison study is based on a database containing real conversation transcriptions in Italian Natural Language. Experimental results and different topic evaluation metrics are analyzed in this paper to determine the most suitable model for the case study. The gained knowledge can be exploited by practitioners to identify the optimal strategy and to perform and evaluate topic modeling on Italian natural language transcriptions of human-to-human conversations. This work can be an asset for grounding applications of topic modeling and can be inspiring for similar case studies in the domain of customer care quality. © 2023 by the authors."
"I present a posthumanist approach to literary interpretation using stylistic analysis. It is posthumanist since i) digital cameras/audio-video resources and editing applications prompt multimodal readings of literary works unlikely from human intuition alone; ii) anthropocentrism in literary texts is defamiliarised. I highlight how stylistic analysis can be used productively for developing multimodal creativity in posthumanist reading by motivating audio-video edits and effects. I model using Anne Brontë’s poem ‘Home’ (1846). When read only with intuition, ‘Home’ communicates young Brontë’s yearning for her family home. In contrast, this article has a non-intuitive digital multimodal realisation of this poem where a young Californian stuck in London because of pandemic (Covid-19) travel restrictions yearns for her home state in the aftermath of wildfires linked to anthropogenic climate change. This posthumanist transformative reading, flagging the negative repercussions of humans for their planetary home, defamiliarises the poem’s anthropocentric normality. Importantly, I show how stylistic analysis of ‘Home’ motivates creative use of audio-visual edits and effects in the posthumanist multimodal reading. The article makes contrast with standard interpretive practice in stylistics (‘humanist stylistics’). It also reflects on the value of posthumanist stylistics for extending students’ creative thinking in an educational context. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Background Digital therapeutics, an emerging type of medical approach, is defined as evidence-based therapeutic interventions through qualified software programs that help prevent, manage, or treat chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which has high social and economic burden. Klivo, a startup certified by the Brazilian Society of Diabetes, developed the first digital therapeutic product for managing T2DM in Brazil, reaching 21 of 24 states. Klivo has continuously been improving its model of behavior change on the basis of an intensive lifestyle intervention method that addresses individuals’ needs–the Klivo Intervention Program for T2DM (KIPDM). To test the most recent version of the KIPDM, we will evaluate the ongoing management of daily life habits in patients with T2DM by measuring clinically significant outcomes. To improve the transparency of further results, here we will present the study protocol and detail the plan for the research project, including the study design and the analysis strategies. Methods The KIPDM will be sponsored by health plans and healthcare provider organizations and will be free for patients (adults aged ≥ 18 years and <65 years; and glycated hemoglobin ≥ 7%). The program will be based on a 6-month management process that will supervise patients remotely. The program will include educational classes via the Klivo app, text messages, or e-mails. Evaluation will include objectively assessing clinical, laboratory, and behavioral outcomes such as health-related quality of life, mental health, medication adherence, and healthcare utilization. For this, validated electronic questionnaires will be available through the Klivo app. The primary outcome will be glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values. The secondary outcome will be time in target blood glucose range (TIR) estimated by capillary glycemia. Other outcomes of interest will be evaluated at baseline and stipulated time points (3 and 6 months after the start of the program). Expected outcomes KIPDM patients should present improved HbA1c and TIR along the intervention as compared to baseline values. Findings from this study will provide insights into the health improvement of T2DM and other cardiometabolic conditions such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and obesity by using a digital therapeutic strategy. By analyzing the patient’s health over time, this study will also contribute to understanding comorbidities associated with this chronic condition in the Brazilian population. © 2023 de Oliveira et al.

"Sarcasm is a linguistic phenomenon indicating a difference between literal meanings and implied intentions. It is commonly used on blogs, e-commerce platforms, and social media. Numerous NLP tasks, such as opinion mining and sentiment analysis systems, are hampered by its linguistic nature in detection. Traditional techniques concentrated mostly on textual incongruity. Recent research demonstrated that the addition of commonsense knowledge into sarcasm detection is an effective new method. However, existing techniques cannot effectively capture sentence “incongruity” information or take good advantage of external knowledge, resulting in imperfect detection performance. In this work, new modules are proposed for maximizing the utilization of the text, the commonsense knowledge, and their interplay. At first, we propose an adaptive incongruity extraction module to compute the distance between each word in the text and commonsense knowledge. Two adaptive incongruity extraction modules are applied to text and commonsense knowledge, respectively, which can obtain two adaptive incongruity attention matrixes. Therefore, each of the words in the sequence receives a new representation with enhanced incongruity semantics. Secondly, we propose the incongruity cross-attention module to extract the incongruity between the text and the corresponding commonsense knowledge, thereby allowing us to pick useful commonsense knowledge in sarcasm detection. In addition, we propose an improved gate module as a feature fusion module of text and commonsense knowledge, which determines how much information should be considered. Experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in achieving state-of-the-art performance on three datasets as well as enjoying improved interpretability. © 2023 by the authors."
"Patient education materials (PEM)s were extracted from provincial cancer agencies to determine their organizational health literacy by evaluating the quality, actionability, and functional accessibility (e.g., readability and understandability) of their PEMs. PEMs from 10 provincial agencies were assessed for their grade reading level (GRL), using eight numerical and two graphical readability scales, and underwent a difficult word analysis. The agencies were assessed for PEM quality using two methods (JAMA benchmarks and DISCERN), while actionability and understandability were assessed using the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT). Seven hundred and eighty-six PEMs were analyzed. The overall average GRL was 9.3 ± 2.1, which is above the recommended 7th GRL for health information. The difficult word analysis showed that 15.4% ± 5.1% of texts contained complex words, 35.8% ± 6.8% of texts contained long words, and 24.2% ± 6.6% of texts contained unfamiliar words. Additionally, there was high overlap between the most frequently identified difficult words in the PEMs and the most frequently misunderstood words by cancer patients identified in the literature. Regarding quality indicators, no agency displayed all four indicators according to the JAMA benchmarks and DISCERN scores ranged between 38 (poor) to 66 (excellent). PEMAT scores ranged between 68% to 88% for understandability and 57% to 88% for actionability. PEMs continue to be written at a level above the recommended GRL across all provinces, and there was overall high variability in the quality, understandability, and actionability of PEMs among provincial agencies. This represents an opportunity to optimize materials, thus ensuring understanding by a wider audience and improving health literacy among Canadian cancer patients. © 2023 by the authors."
"A machine learning model for correcting errors in Ukrainian texts has been developed. It was established that the neural network has the ability to correct simple sentences written in Ukrainian; however, the development of a full-fledged system requires the use of spell-checking using dictionaries and the checking of rules, both simple and those based on the result of parsing dependencies or other features. In order to save computing resources, a pre-trained BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer) type neural network was used. Such neural networks have half as many parameters as other pre-trained models and show satisfactory results in correcting grammatical and stylistic errors. Among the ready-made neural network models, the pre-trained neural network model mT5 (a multilingual variant of T5 or Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) showed the best performance according to the BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) and METEOR (metric for evaluation of translation with explicit ordering) metrics. © 2023 by the authors."
"Danmaku data from an online course contains implicit information about the students, the teacher, and the course itself. To discover the information, we design a behavior-sentiment-topic mining procedure, and apply it on the danmaku from two electronics courses on Bilibili, a popular video sharing platform in China. The procedure enables us to obtain behavior patterns, text sentiments, and hidden topics, of those danmaku comments effectively. Results show similarities and differences between the danmaku from Fundamentals of Analog Electronics and that from Fundamentals of Digital Electronics. Some interesting observations are given according to the results. For example, students tend to experience an emotional upsurge right before the end of a course, which is due to their fulfilment for completing the course. Based on the observations, we make some suggestions for students, teachers, and platforms on how to improve the learning outcomes using the results of danmaku analysis. © 2023 by the authors."
"The Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a graph representing causal pathways for informing the conduct of an observational study. The use of DAGs allows transparent communication of a causal model between researchers and can prevent over-adjustment biases when conducting causal inference, permitting greater confidence and transparency in reported causal estimates. In the era of ‘big data’ and increasing number of observational studies, the role of the DAG is becoming more important. Recent best-practice guidance for constructing a DAG with reference to the literature has been published in the ‘Evidence synthesis for constructing DAGs’ (ESC-DAG) protocol. We aimed to assess adherence to these principles for DAGs constructed within perioperative literature. Following registration on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) and with adherence to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting framework for systematic reviews, we searched the Excerpta Medica dataBASE (Embase), the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) and Cochrane databases for perioperative observational research incorporating a DAG. Nineteen studies were included in the final synthesis. No studies demonstrated any evidence of following the mapping stage of the protocol. Fifteen (79%) fulfilled over half of the translation and integration one stages of the protocol. Adherence with one stage did not guarantee fulfilment of the other. Two studies (11%) undertook the integration two stage. Unmeasured variables were handled inconsistently between studies. Only three (16%) studies included unmeasured variables within their DAG and acknowledged their implication within the main text. Overall, DAGs that were constructed for use in perioperative observational literature did not consistently adhere to best practice, potentially limiting the benefits of subsequent causal inference. Further work should focus on exploring reasons for this deviation and increasing methodological transparency around DAG construction. © 2023 Watson et al.

"INTRODUCTION:Patients with hepatic encephalopathy (HE) suffer from significant symptoms and impaired quality of life. Improved understanding on the potential benefits of first-line HE therapies may aid patient-provider discussions regarding expected benefits of HE treatments. We aimed to perform a systematic review to assess the effects of lactulose and rifaximin on patient-reported outcomes (PROs).METHODS:We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases for randomized trials or prospective cohort studies using lactulose and/or rifaximin for the management of HE and assessing changes in PRO using PRO instruments. Physician reviewers independently reviewed titles, abstracts, and full texts and extracted data independently. We performed random-effects meta-analyses to examine the effects of lactulose and rifaximin on PROs.RESULTS:We identified 16 studies representing 1,376 patients that met inclusion criteria. Most studies assessed treatment of covert HE. In patients with covert HE, lactulose significantly improved overall patient-reported health-related quality of life measured by the Sickness Impact Profile with an estimated pooled mean difference of 6.92 (95% confidence interval: 6.66-7.18) and showed improvements in several subscales. Conversely, rifaximin demonstrated a nonstatistically significant mean difference in the total Sickness Impact Profile of 4.76 (95% confidence interval: -4.23 to 13.76), with strong evidence of heterogeneity between these studies. Studies examining other PRO instruments showed improvements in overall health-related quality of life, social functioning, and sleep from both lactulose and rifaximin.DISCUSSION:Patients with HE treated with lactulose or rifaximin reported improvements in important PROs. These results may inform provider-patient communication and help manage patient expectations regarding the potential benefits of HE therapies. © 2023 Wolters Kluwer Health. All rights reserved."
"Reading disability (RD), which affects between 5 and 17% of the population worldwide, is the most prevalent form of learning disability, and is associated with underactivation of a universal reading network in children. However, recent research suggests there are differences in learning rates on cognitive predictors of reading performance, as well as differences in activation patterns within the reading neural network, based on orthographic depth (i.e., transparent/shallow vs. deep/opaque orthographies) in children with RD. Recently, we showed that native English-speaking children with RD exhibit impaired performance on a maze learning task that taps into the same neural networks that are activated during reading. In addition, we demonstrated that genetic risk for RD strengthens the relationship between reading impairment and maze learning performance. However, it is unclear whether the results from these studies can be broadly applied to children from other language orthographies. In this study, we examined whether low reading skill was associated with poor maze learning performance in native English-speaking and native German-speaking children, and the influence of genetic risk for RD on cognition and behavior. In addition, we investigated the link between genetic risk and performance on this task in an orthographically diverse sample of children attending an English-speaking international school in Germany. The results from our data suggest that children with low reading skill, or with a genetic risk for reading impairment, exhibit impaired performance on the maze learning task, regardless of orthographic depth. However, these data also suggest that orthographic depth influences the degree of impairment on this task. The maze learning task requires the involvement of various cognitive processes and neural networks that underlie reading, but is not influenced by potential differences in reading experience due to lack of text or oral reporting. As a fully automated tool, it does not require specialized training to administer, and current results suggest it may be a practicable screening tool for early identification of reading impairment across orthographies. © 2022 S.

"Objective: To evaluate the role of cancer stem cell biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis of OSCC patients. Methods: The search strategy was entered into PubMed NLM, EBSCO CINAHL, EBSCO Dentistry & Oral Sciences Source, Wiley Cochrane Library, and Scopus. The full text eligible studies (n=7) were assessed for their quality using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist to evaluates the methodological quality of the studies based on possibility of bias in its design, conduct, and analysis. Selected studies were further analysed based on different parameters such as publication year, sample size, and outcomes. Results: A total of 432 studies were identified through the search strategy. A total of 306 records were removed before screening either because of duplication or marked ineligible by the automation tools. The screened records were 126 out of which 104 were removed as they were not conducted on OSCC. Twenty-two reports were sought for retrieval, however, we could not find the full text of 3 studies and12 studies were excluded because the biomarkers were not associated with cancer stem cells. The most common cancer stem cell biomarkers associated with OSCC were MCT1,VEGF-A, GD15, HIF1 α, Ki67, Hsp 70, Cyclin D1, and CD44. Conclusions: Various stem cell biomarkers have been found to have diagnostic and prognostic role in oral squamous cell carcinoma such as Cyclin D1, VEGF-A, GD15, and CD44. They can be used to predict the overall survival rate, local progression-free survival rate, and distant metastasis-free survival rate in Head and Neck cancer patients. © 2023 Pakistan Medical Association.

"Sentiment analysis has become an important area of research in natural language processing. This technique has a wide range of applications, such as comprehending user preferences in ecommerce feedback portals, politics, and in governance. However, accurate sentiment analysis requires robust text representation techniques that can convert words into precise vectors that represent the input text. There are two categories of text representation techniques: lexicon-based techniques and machine learning-based techniques. From research, both techniques have limitations. For instance, pre-trained word embeddings, such as Word2Vec, Glove, and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT), generate vectors by considering word distances, similarities, and occurrences ignoring other aspects such as word sentiment orientation. Aiming at such limitations, this paper presents a sentiment classification model (named LeBERT) combining sentiment lexicon, N-grams, BERT, and CNN. In the model, sentiment lexicon, N-grams, and BERT are used to vectorize words selected from a section of the input text. CNN is used as the deep neural network classifier for feature mapping and giving the output sentiment class. The proposed model is evaluated on three public datasets, namely, Amazon products’ reviews, Imbd movies’ reviews, and Yelp restaurants’ reviews datasets. Accuracy, precision, and F-measure are used as the model performance metrics. The experimental results indicate that the proposed LeBERT model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art models, with a F-measure score of 88.73% in binary sentiment classification. © 2023 by the authors."
"Citation and citation-based metrics are traditionally used to quantify the scholarly impact of scientific papers. However, for documents without citation data, i.e., newly published papers, the citation-based metrics are not available. By leveraging deep representation techniques, we propose a text-content based approach that may reveal the scholarly impact of papers without human domain-specific knowledge. Specifically, a large-scale Pre-Trained Model (PTM) with 110 million parameters is utilized to automatically encode the paper into the vector representation. Two indicators, τ(Topicality) and σ(Originality), are then proposed based on the learned representations. These two indicators leverage the spatial relations of paper representations in the semantic space to capture the impact-related characteristics of a scientific paper. Extensive experiments have been conducted on a COVID-19 open research dataset with 1,056,660 papers. The experimental results demonstrate that the deep representation learning method can better capture the scientific content in the published literature; and the proposed indicators are positively and significantly associated with a paper's potential scholarly impact. In the multivariate regression analysis for the potential impact of a paper, the coefficients of σand τare 5.4915 (P<0.001) and 6.6879 (P<0.001) for next 6 months prediction, 12.9964 (P<0.001) and 13.8678 (P<0.001) for next 12 months prediction. The proposed framework may facilitate the study of how scholarly impact is generated, from a textual representation perspective. © 2023 Elsevier Editora Ltda. All rights reserved."
"Whether prone positioning (PP) modulates acute lung inflammation by the modulation of biomechanical forces of ventilator-induced lung injuries (VILIs) remains unclear. We aimed to demonstrate that PP decreases acute lung inflammation in animals with experimental acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Animals were under general anesthesia and protective ventilation (tidal volume 6 mL·kg-1, PEEP 5 cmH2O). ARDS was induced by intratracheal instillation of chlorohydric acid. Animals were then randomized to PP, or to supine position (SP). After 4 h, a positron emission tomography (PET) acquisition with [11C](R)-PK11195 was performed coupled with computerized tomography (CT) acquisitions, allowing the CT quantification of VILI-associated parameters. [11C](R)-PK11195 lung uptake was quantified using pharmacokinetic multicompartment models. Analyses were performed on eight lung sections distributed along the antero-posterior dimension. Six animals were randomized to PP, five to SP (median [Formula: see text]/[Formula: see text] [interquartile range]: 164 [102-269] mmHg). The normally aerated compartment was significantly redistributed to the posterior lung regions of animals in PP, compared with SP. Dynamic strain was significantly increased in posterior regions of SP animals, compared with PP. After 4 h, animals in PP had a significantly lower uptake of [11C](R)-PK11195, compared with SP. [11C](R)-PK11195 regional uptake was independently associated with the study group, dynamic strain, tidal hyperinflation, and regional respiratory system compliance in multivariate analysis. In an experimental model of ARDS, 4 h of PP significantly decreased acute lung inflammation assessed with PET. The beneficial impact of PP on acute lung inflammation was consecutive to the combination of decreased biomechanical forces and changes in the respiratory system mechanics.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Prone position decreases acute lung macrophage inflammation quantified in vivo with [11C](R)-PK11195 positron emission tomography in an experimental acute respiratory distress syndrome. Regional macrophage inflammation is maximal in the most anterior and posterior lung section of supine animals, in relation with increased regional tidal strain and hyperinflation, and reduced regional lung compliance."
"Background Dental caries is defined as a dynamic diet microbial disease of teeth, which results in localized dissolution and destruction of the mineralized tissues of the teeth. Dental caries develops when there is a susceptible tooth exposed to pathogenic bacteria in the presence of substrate. Under these conditions, the bacteria metabolize substrate to form acid, which decalcifies teeth. Dental caries is among the top oral health problem in both developing and developed nations affecting around 20–50% of the population globally. Objective This study was conducted to assess the magnitude, associated factors, and antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of bacterial isolates among adult dental caries patients visiting Hiwot Fana specialized university hospital dental clinic from April 23 to-June 23, 2021. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 290 study participants. Convenient sampling techniques were used to select the study participants. Data was entered into Epi-info version 7.2.4.0 and exported to Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20 for analysis. The result was explained by using summary measures of texts, tables, and graphs after analysis by using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. Statistical significance was defined at a p-value of less than 0.05. Result The overall magnitude of bacteria among dental caries patients was 68.3%. S mutans 74 (37.4%) and Lactobacillus spp 58(29.3%) were the most predominant isolated bacteria. Lack of teeth brushing (AOR: 2.8, 95% CI:1.6, 4.6), the habit of chewing khat always (AOR:4.8, 95%CI:2.10,8.80), the habit of chewing khat sometimes (AOR: 3.8: 95% CI: 2.520,9.48) and consumption of soft drinks (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI:1.2,3.1) were significantly associated with bacterial dental caries. Almost, all bacterial isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin compared to Amoxicillin, Azithromycin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, doxycycline, erythromycin, gentamycin, penicillin, tetracycline, vancomycin and tobramycin. Conclusion Teeth brushing habit, consumption of soft drink and a habit of chewing khat affects dental health and they are associated with bacterial dental caries.

"In the task of text sentiment analysis, the main problem that we face is that the traditional word vectors represent lack of polysemy, the Recurrent Neural Network cannot be trained in parallel, and the classification accuracy is not high. We propose a sentiment classification model based on the proposed Sliced Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Sliced Bi-GRU), Multi-head Self-Attention mechanism, and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers embedding. First, the word vector representation obtained by the BERT pre-trained language model is used as the embedding layer of the neural network. Then the input sequence is sliced into subsequences of equal length. And the Bi-sequence Gated Recurrent Unit is applied to extract the subsequent feature information. The relationship between words is learned sequentially via the Multi-head Self-attention mechanism. Finally, the emotional tendency of the text is output by the Softmax function. Experiments show that the classification accuracy of this model on the Yelp 2015 dataset and the Amazon dataset is 74.37% and 62.57%, respectively. And the training speed of the model is better than most existing models, which verifies the effectiveness of the model. © 2023 by the authors."
"In curriculum development, syllabus creation is an important activity. The need for a syllabus repository and data extraction is essential for creating a new syllabus. Faculties do this job manually by adding topics from their intelligence as well as analyzing syllabuses of the same course available on the search engine. Because it is a time-consuming job, this research aims to propose and implement a text-analyzing tool. The methodology is used, first to create a syllabus repository of computer science courses, do data extraction & normalization, analyzes the contents of different syllabuses, and suggests the contents to the faculties. This tool is experimented on the sample for creating the syllabus of C Programming. The result of the tool is that it suggests the topics that can be included in the syllabus to the faculties. The time and effort required to create a syllabus are reduced by using this tool. In the future weightage to the syllabuses can be given for classification that will give more accurate results while analyzing syllabuses. This tool can be improved by using machine learning algorithms for creating syllabus repositories and data extraction. Semantic comparison can give more accurate results by creating a specific model for computer terminologies. © 2023 by the authors."
"Objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in older adults' greater reliance on technology to contact friends and families. However, less is known regarding the association between frequency of varying modes of communication and loneliness among older adults during COVID-19, and current findings are mixed. Therefore, this study aimed to advance this understanding. Methods: Using the National Health and Aging Trends Study COVID-19 supplement data, multinomial regression analyses assessed how the frequency of four modes of contact (i.e., phone calls; electronic and social messaging such as e-mails/texts/social media messages; video calls; and in-person visits) during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with feelings of loneliness among older adults compared to prepandemic (n = 2,564). Results: Compared to never/less than once a week in-person visits, daily in-person visits were associated with lower odds of reporting more frequent loneliness during COVID-19 versus ""about the same""as pre-COVID-19 while controlling for demographics, access to information and communication technologies (ICTs), digital literacy, and health covariates. Compared to those who reported never/less than once a week contact by electronic and social messaging, more frequent contact was associated with higher odds of reporting more frequent loneliness during COVID-19 versus ""about the same""as pre-COVID-19 while controlling for other variables in the model. Phone calls and video calls were not significantly related to loneliness. Discussion: Results suggest that ICTs may not decrease loneliness among older adults. This article discusses potential reasons and barriers, including digital exclusion, and provides recommendations to mitigate the negative effects of social isolation through technology for older adults.  © 2022 The Author(s).

"Introduction: A woman’s nutrition during pregnancy and nursing affects the mother and the growing child. Similarly, the first two years of a child’s life are critical to their growth and development and are facilitated by optimum nutrition. Women’s nutrition-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices influence household food and nutrition security. Mobile health (mHealth) is a potentially effective health intervention in pandemic situations when physical gatherings are restricted. Objectives: To examine the effectiveness of a mobile phone-based nutrition education intervention targeting pregnant and nursing mothers in six Sri Lankan divisional secretariat areas. Method: This intervention was evaluated using a before and after within-subjects design. The intervention included 19 messages over four weeks sent via mobile phone, covering nutrition themes such as pregnancy care, infant and young child-feeding, diet, family care for mother and child, and cash management. The intervention was evaluated based on a quantitative survey using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire and qualitative interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. The study population was pregnant and nursing mothers. The objective of the qualitative interviews was to identify how respondents used messages and how satisfied they were with the project. The outcome measures were awareness/knowledge, attitudes, social norms, self-efficacy, behaviour intentions, and practices of pregnant and nursing mothers. Trained enumerators collected data using a mobile phone. Results: A total of 996 pregnant and nursing mothers participated in the pre-assessment survey, of which 720 completed the post-assessment. Most were nursing mothers (84.2% pre- and 78.9% post-assessment). Participants provided positive feedback on the intervention. Knowledge/awareness (t = −18.70, p < 0.01) and attitudes (t = −2.00, p < 0.05) increased when exposed to the intervention. Favourable improvements in the practices were also observed. Mothers’ practices related to breastfeeding and 24-h dietary diversity showed a statistically significant improvement. However, social norms and behaviour intentions did not significantly improve. The qualitative component also revealed favourable responses. Conclusion and Recommendations: The mobile intervention improved participants’ knowledge, awareness, attitude, and practices, but not social norms or behaviour intentions. This approach is recommended to be used on a larger scale in community settings. In addition, mobile technology could drive intervention in pandemic-related situations. © 2023 by the authors."
"Textual data suffers from two main problems, large number of features and class imbalance. Many conventional approaches and their variants exist in literature to solve both these problems. The classic synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is the most explored technique for balancing the dataset. We introduced a new algorithm to balance the dataset, named distributed SMOTE (D_SMOTE), which overcomes the problem of lack of density and reducing the formation of small disjuncts. Further, another problem handled is the large number of features or high-dimensionality. To solve high-dimensionality, a novel feature selection technique is introduced known as modified biogeography-based optimization (M_BBO). The proposed model, M_BBO, performs modification in ranking of variables using feature weighting algorithm rather than randomly ranking. We have proposed two new expressions in D_SMOTE and one new expression in M_BBO. The extensive experimental results are computed out on four text classification datasets with four machine learning classifiers. The results are concluded using three performance measures, area under curve, G-mean, and F1-score. Our empirical and statistical observation for four class-imbalanced datasets shows that the proposed D_SMOTE outperforms the other similar oversampling technique. We have also compared our proposed algorithm, M_BBO+D_SMOTE, with other models on 17 imbalanced text classification datasets. Our model outperformed the other models in 14 datasets. We have also compared our model with bidirectional encoder representations from transformers. To validate the experimental analysis, statistical Friedman test is employed. © 2020 IEEE."
"With the development of science and computer technology, social networks are changing our daily lives. However, this leads to new, often hidden dangers in areas such as cybersecurity. Of these, the most complex and harmful is the Advanced Persistent Threat attack (APT attack). The development of personality analysis and prediction technology provides the APT attack a good opportunity to infiltrate personality privacy. Malicious people can exploit existing personality classifiers to attack social texts and steal users’ personal information. Therefore, it is of high importance to hide personal privacy information in social texts. Based on the personality privacy protection technology of adversarial examples, we proposed a Supervised Character Resemble Substitution personality adversarial method (SCRS) in this paper, which hides personality information in social texts through adversarial examples to realize personality privacy protection. The adversarial examples should be capable of successfully disturbing the personality classifier while maintaining the original semantics without reducing human readability. Therefore, this paper proposes a measure index of “label contribution” to select the words that are important to the label. At the same time, in order to maintain higher readability, this paper uses character-level resemble substitution to generate adversarial examples. Experimental validation shows that our method is able to generate adversarial examples with good attack effect and high readability. © 2023 by the authors."
"The normalized compression distance (NCD) is a similarity measure between a pair of finite objects based on compression. Clustering methods usually use distances (e.g., Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance) to measure the similarity between objects. The NCD is yet another distance with particular characteristics that can be used to build the starting distance matrix for methods such as hierarchical clustering or K-medoids. In this work, we propose Zgli, a novel Python module that enables the user to compute the NCD between files inside a given folder. Inspired by the CompLearn Linux command line tool, this module iterates on it by providing new text file compressors, a new compression-by-column option for tabular data, such as CSV files, and an encoder for small files made up of categorical data. Our results demonstrate that compression by column can yield better results than previous methods in the literature when clustering tabular data. Additionally, the categorical encoder shows that it can augment categorical data, allowing the use of the NCD for new data types. One of the advantages is that using this new feature does not require knowledge or context of the data. Furthermore, the fact that the new proposed module is written in Python, one of the most popular programming languages for machine learning, potentiates its use by developers to tackle problems with a new approach based on compression. This pipeline was tested in clinical data and proved a promising computational strategy by providing patient stratification via clusters aiding in precision medicine. © 2023 by the authors."
"A noninvasive tool for cardiovascular risk stratification has not yet been established in the clinical routine analysis. Previous studies suggest a prolonged Tpeak-Tend interval (the interval from the peak to the end of the T-wave) to be predictive of death. This meta-analysis was designed to systematically evaluate the association of the Tpeak-Tend interval with mortality outcomes. Medline (via PubMed), Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched from 1 January 2008 to 21 July 2020 for articles reporting the ascertainment of the Tpeak-Tend interval and observation of all-cause-mortality. The search yielded 1920 citations, of which 133 full-texts were retrieved and 29 observational studies involving 23,114 patients met the final criteria. All-cause deaths had longer Tpeak-Tend intervals compared to survivors by a standardized mean difference of 0.41 (95% CI 0.23–0.58) and patients with a long Tpeak-Tend interval had a higher risk of all-cause death compared to patients with a short Tpeak-Tend interval by an overall odds ratio of 2.33 (95% CI 1.57–3.45). Heart rate correction, electrocardiographic (ECG) measurement methods and the selection of ECG leads were major sources of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses revealed that heart rate correction did not affect the association of the Tpeak-Tend interval with mortality outcomes, whereas this finding was not evident in all measurement methods. The Tpeak-Tend interval was found to be significantly associated with all-cause mortality. Further studies are warranted to confirm the prognostic value of the Tpeak-Tend interval. © 2023 by the authors."
"Cyberbullying is a form of aggression in which electronic communication such as e-mails, mobile phone calls, text messages, instant messenger contacts, photos, social networking sites and personal webpages are used to threaten or intimidate individuals. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) counselling based on empathic training may reduce cyberbullying among adolescents. The present study investigated the impact of developing empathy skills in reducing cyberbullying among a sample of adolescents using two groups (i.e., an experimental group and control group). The experimental group received counselling intervention based on CBT with special focus on improving empathy whereas the control group received CBT general counselling. The participants comprised 217 adolescents (experimental group = 98 adolescents, control group = 119 adolescents) with a mean age of 15.1 years (SD ± 1.5). The measures included the Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ) and the Bullying, Cyberbullying Scale for Adolescents (BCS-A). Results showed that there were statistically significant differences on TEQ scores and BCS-A scores in the experimental and control groups after the intervention but more so in favor of the experimental group in terms of reduced levels of cyberbullying (both victimization and perpetration). Positive gains among the experimental group in both empathy and reduced cyberbullying remained at two-month follow-up. It is recommended that teachers and school counselors tackling cyberbullying should use empathy training as part of their cyberbullying prevention programs. © 2023 by the authors."
"Inferencing skills uniquely contribute to the reading comprehension skills of older grade-school and college students. Evidence also suggests that children's reading component skills, such as decoding and language comprehension, differentially contribute to various reading comprehension assessments. However,additional research is needed to investigate the complex relations of foundational reading skills and inferencing skills to sentence-level and passage-level reading comprehension assessments with struggling adult readers. This study examined the relations between struggling adult readers' (N = 125) text-based (decoding, fluency), language-based (morphological awareness, vocabulary, language comprehension), and inferencing skills. The indirect effects of language-based reading component skills to sentence-level and passage-level reading comprehension measures through inferencing were also examined. Vocabulary and morphological awareness indirectly predicted passage-level reading comprehension through inferencing. Word reading fluency and vocabulary knowledge uniquely predicted sentence-level comprehension whereas inferencing skills predicted passage-level comprehension. These results suggest that inferencing is an important contributor to the reading comprehension skills of struggling adult readers. These findings also emphasize a need for multiple measures of comprehension to understand the complexity and underlying component processes involved in struggling adults' reading comprehension skills. Educational implications for adult literacy programs are discussed. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"Background: Understanding patient experience is key to optimize access and quality of outpatient cancer rehabilitation (physical or occupational therapy, PT/OT) services. Methods: We performed a retrospective mixed-method analysis of rehabilitation medical record data to better understand patient experience and aspects of care that influenced experience. From the medical record, we extracted case characteristics, patient experience data (Net Promoter Survey®, NPS) and patient-reported outcome (PRO) data. We categorized cases as ‘promoters’ (i.e., highly likely to recommend rehabilitation) or ‘detractors’, then calculated NPS score (−100 [worst] to 100 [best]). We identified key themes from NPS free-text comments using inductive content analysis, then used Pearson [r] or Spearman [ρ] correlation to explore relationships between NPS, characteristics, and PRO improvement. Results: Patients (n = 383) were 60.51 ± 12.02 years old, predominantly women with breast cancer (69.2%), and attended 14.23 ± 12.37 visits. Most were ‘promoters’ (92%); NPS score was 91.4. Patients described two experiences (themes) that influenced their likelihood to recommend rehabilitation: (1) feeling comfortable with the process and (2) observable improvement in health/functioning, and described attributes of clinic staff, environment and clinical care that influenced themes. Likelihood to recommend rehabilitation was associated with achieving the minimal clinical important difference on a PRO (ρ = 0.21, p < 0.001) and cancer type (ρ = 0.10, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Patients who received specialized cancer PT/OT were highly likely to recommend rehabilitation. Feeling comfortable with the rehabilitation process and making observable improvements in health and/or functioning influenced likelihood to recommend. Rehabilitation providers should leverage the findings of this study optimize access to and quality of cancer rehab services. © 2023 by the authors."
"In the era of the Internet of Things, innovative business model initiatives continue to deepen, and the trend of search domains continues to expand. This paper aims to scientifically analyze research trends of the Internet of Things in relation to Business Model Innovation through bibliometric studies. The data were collected using the Clarivate Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection (SSCI and SCI indexed) from 2005 to 2022 (November). However, the publications for the research domains started in 2015. The results show that scientific publications on the Internet of Things in relation to Business Model Innovation have increased gradually since 2019. The WoS database is utilized for analyses because it contains journals and conference proceedings deemed more relevant by the academic domain and highly reputable sources for bibliometric studies. The VOS viewer, R Language, and Microsoft Excel were also used to analyze and complete the study. Bibliometric and scientometric analyses were conducted to identify publication patterns, text analysis, most important keywords (co-word, word cloud, and co-occurrence), trends for the topicality, and content clustering for the publication periods. The visualization of the research trends of the Internet of Things in relation to Business Model Innovation resulted in four co-occurrence clusters leading to some of the topic areas mentioned as follows: (1) The Internet of Things, (2) Business model innovation, (3) Technology infrastructure, and (4) Digital transformation and capabilities. The results of this study will assist academics in identifying worldwide research trends related to the Internet of Things and Business Model Innovation as well as recommending future research areas. © 2023 by the authors."
"Narratology is a discipline that undertakes the task of analyzing the techniques and narrative structures of a narrative text which is presented as a report of interconnected incidents in an artistic form. Narratological study of a narrative text such as Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, with its different religious, mythological, philosophical and psychological aspects, provides new perspectives for the readers. Also, with a structural analysis of this play and understanding its narrative functions, one can reach a better understanding of its themes. The uncertainty of meaning in Waiting for Godot is one of the significant characteristics of this play which makes various readings possible for the reader. Therefore, by using a descriptive analytical methodology and drawing upon Roland Barthes’ theory of narrative codes, this study tries to analyze the play in order to show the open and manifold quality of different meanings in this play; in other words, it examines whether the text of Waiting for Godot is a scriptible (“writerly”) text or a lisible (“readerly”) text a closed text, turning the reader into a mere consumer. Also, the narrative functions of the text as well as its implications and hidden meanings are analyzed to gain a better understanding of the hidden concepts. The findings of this research reveal that, 1) the text of the play Waiting for Godot has an adaptable structure to Barthes’ theory of narrative codes; as such, in some occasions, Barthes’ critical patterns about the excessive stillness or lack of movement of the actors challenge the text of the play on its aesthetic foundation and provide a deeper understanding of the two characters, the “half crazy” and the “half philosopher”. 2) By creating multiple oppositions and by using the genre of absurd theater, Beckett has managed to create relationships between the characters in their dialogues, through which he successfully conveys his religious and philosophical ideas to the readers. 3) This play is a writerly text and has multiple meanings which are reproduced by the reader and eventually lead the readers toward a better understanding of its hidden themes and beauties. © The Author(s)."
"This study assessed differences in the oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) between subtypes of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). For statistical analysis, participants were divided according to their subtype: classical EDS (cEDS), hypermobile EDS (hEDS), and vascular EDS (vEDS). All other subtypes were descriptively analyzed. Free-text questions and the German short form of the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) were used. Finally, 295 questionnaires were included, representing 10 different EDS subtypes. The mean OHIP score of all participants was 19.6 points (standard derivation (SD) ± 12.3). The most predominant subtypes showed similar reduced OHRQoL, with 18.0 (cEDS, ±12.9), 19.5 (hEDS, ±12.0), and 15.2 (vEDS, ±11.6) OHIP points. For all other subtypes, the OHIP values varied. Participants waited an average of 21.8 years (±12.8) for their diagnosis. However, within the predominant subtypes, vEDS patients waited a noticeably shorter period of 13.3 years (±13.0; p = 0.004) compared to participants with hEDS. Additionally, this study showed no difference in OHRQoL for the predominant subtypes regardless of whether a participant was a self-help group member (18.8, ±12.0) or not (19.4, ±12.1; p = 0.327). © 2023 by the authors."
"In the context of China’s “digital power” strategy, the realization of a green and low-carbon shift in manufacturing has become a necessary condition to promote the economy, and the digital factor has increasingly become a new driving force. The text mining and IPCC methods were used to measure manufacturing enterprise digitalization and the level of enterprise carbon emission intensity from 2011 to 2021, respectively. This study then explored the impact of digitalization on manufacturing enterprise carbon emission intensity based on the least squares method model and instrumental variable method model. This research comes to three conclusions. (1) Digitalization can significantly reduce the enterprise carbon emission intensity of China’s manufacturing industry, and the influence shows a “marginal increase.” (2) Notably, a mechanism analysis indicates the intermediary effect sizes of four crucial intermediaries: green technology innovation > financing constraint > information asymmetry > energy use efficiency. Interestingly, digital information resources positively moderate the positive effect of digitalization on carbon emission intensity through three paths: financing constraints, green technology innovation, and information asymmetry. (3) The influence shows evident signs of heterogeneity—as environmental regulation, financial development, executive education, and R&D quality advance, the inhibiting effect of digitalization on enterprise carbon emission intensity becomes more pronounced. Finally, corresponding policy suggestions are proposed. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Breastfeeding rates have stagnated recently despite recommendations to breastfeed until age 2 years. Antenatal breast milk expression (ABME) is a method used to prepare the breast for breastfeeding. However, there is limited evidence available on the benefits, risks, and impact of ABME on maternal-infant breastfeeding dyads. Methods: This review identified and summarized studies on women who engaged in ABME and their personal experiences. Databases searched included PubMed MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and EMBASE. Initially, abstracts and titles were reviewed, and then, full-text studies were screened for inclusion by two blinded authors. Two authors assessed the quality of the studies using a standardized tool, two authors completed data extraction, and one author completed data harmonization into tables. Results: A total of 1,410 studies were identified (after duplicates removed) and 10 citations qualified for the inclusion criteria. Only two studies received an overall rating of strong quality and low-risk bias. The selected articles varied in primary outcomes; however, main focuses were experiences, knowledge, and perspective after practicing ABME. Data varied on timing of ABME, but most studies started between 34 and 36 weeks. The average amount of expressed milk was reported in four studies but was variable. Conclusions: This systematic review found that the literature is limited regarding ABME, and most studies were focused on women with diabetes. The current limited evidence suggests that ABME may be a helpful tool in improving maternal breastfeeding confidence and breastfeeding outcomes. Negative side effects reported related to ABME included difficulty learning the technique, discomfort, and feeling of awkwardness while expressing. Future research should focus on higher quality studies regarding use of ABME, proper teaching of ABME technique, and the use of ABME to improve breastfeeding outcomes in diverse populations of maternal-infant dyads.  © 2023 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers."
"—The article aimed to determine the specificity of computer game discourse, its features, key linguistic characteristics, and communicative features. The methodology included the analysis of computer game discourse materials, in particular, dictionary articles, texts of electronic messages, and computer conferences, as well as recordings of fragments of the spoken language of users and users of computer games. The specific feature of computer discourse is the selective combination of features, typical for other types and forms of communication. Computer discourse has some communicative features: electronic communication channel; mediated communication; distance communication; emotionality transmission through emoji symbols; genre heterogeneity; discourse participants' creativity. Computer discourse is characterized by the dominance of English-language lexical bases (barbarisms and semantic translations) and a tendency to unify the norms and rules of communication. Despite such specificity, computer jargon in its functioning and especially word formation is subject to the laws of the Ukrainian language. In particular, affixal, non-affixal, and lexico-semantic are the most widespread modes of word formation in the computer lexicon. At the same time, lexico-semantic can be combined with other known ways. Computer vocabulary is characterized by the use of speech games and means of speech expression. The key tendency in the formation of computer discourse is to reduce the ways of information transmission as much as possible. © 2023 ACADEMY PUBLICATION."
"Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for aspect-based sentiment classification has attracted a lot of attention recently due to their promising performance in handling complex structure information. However, previous methods based on GCN focused mainly on examining the structure of syntactic dependency relationships, which were subject to the noise and sparsity problem. Furthermore, these methods tend to focus on one kind of structural information (namely syntactic dependency) while ignoring many other kinds of rich structures between words. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel GCN based model, named Structure-Enhanced Dual-Channel Graph Convolutional Network (SEDC-GCN). Specifically, we first exploit the rich structure information by constructing a text sequence graph and an enhanced dependency graph, then design a dual-channel graph encoder to model the structure information from the two graphs. After that, we propose two kinds of aspect-specific attention, i.e., aspect-specific semantic attention and aspect-specific structure attention, to learn sentence representation from two different perspectives, i.e., the semantic perspective based on the text encoder, and the structure perspective based on the dual-channel graph encoder. Finally, we merge the sentence representations from the above two perspectives and obtain the final sentence representation. We experimentally validate our proposed model SEDC-GCN by comparing with seven strong baseline methods. In terms of the metric accuracy, SEDC-GCN achieves performance gains of 74.42%, 77.74%, 83.30%, 81.73% and 90.75% on TWITTER, LAPTOP, REST14, REST15, and REST16, respectively, which are 0.35%, 4.22%, 1.62%, 0.70% and 2.01% better than the best performing baseline BiGCN. Similar performance improvements are also observed in terms of the metric macro-averaged F1 score. The ablation study further demonstrates the effectiveness of each component of SEDC-GCN. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"The article deals with one of the effects of health inequalities and gaps in access to treatments for rare diseases, namely health-driven emigration. The purpose of the paper is to systematize knowledge about the phenomenon of health emigration observed among families affected by rare diseases, for which reimbursed treatment is available, but only in selected countries. The topic proved to be niche; the issue of “health emigration in rare diseases” is an area for exploration. Therefore, the further analysis used text mining and machine learning methods based on a database selected based on keywords related to this issue. The results made it possible to systematize the guesses made by researchers in management and economic fields, to identify the most common keywords and thematic clusters around the perspective of the patient, drug manufacturer and treatment reimbursement decision-maker, and the perspective integrating all the others. Since the topic of health emigration was not directly addressed in the selected sources, the authors attempted to define the related concepts and discussed the importance of this phenomenon in managing the support system in rare diseases. Thus, they indicated directions for further research in this area. © 2023 by the authors."
"As a strategic guarantee for the rapid development of electric vehicles, the construction and development of electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) is closely related to the industrial policies formulated by the government. This paper takes policy texts relevant to EVCI in China since 2014 as the research materials, taking policy instruments and the industrial chain as analysis dimensions. Policy content analysis is conducted to explore the EVCI policy content, structure characteristics of policy instruments, and evolution characteristics of EVCI policy in China. Our research reveals that China’s EVCI policy system is relatively perfect, but the use of policy instruments is not balanced and, in particular, is not coordinated with the EVCI industrial chain they supported. In this regard, the government should pay more attention to the use of demand-side policy instrument to enhance the driving force for the development of the EVCI industry. With more scientific and reasonable arrangement of the distribution and implementation of policy instruments in the EVCI industrial chain, the benign development of China’s EVCI industry can be promoted. This research contributes to strengthening the management and policy instrumentation of the central Chinese government, in order to support the realization of good governance of EVCI and the new energy vehicle development. © 2023 by the authors."
"The COVID-19 pandemic caused extensive disruption to higher education, highlighting the negative impacts of emergency shift to online instruction. As a result, advantages of intentionally designed, online programs in higher education were overshadowed during the pandemic. Furthermore, socioeconomic disparities were exacerbated during the pandemic which extended to STEM undergraduate transfer students, who are more likely to be low-income, from historically underrepresented groups, older, and first generation in their family to attend college. To better understand the impact of the pandemic on STEM undergraduates, including those in an intentionally designed online program, ordinal regression analysis of 352 student survey respondents enrolled in a life sciences major at a large, R1 institution in the United States spring 2020 through fall 2021 was performed. Three student types are compared: on-campus, first-time in college (FTIC); on-campus transfer (OC-TR); and online transfer (ONL-TR) students. The latter group receives all course delivery online, whereas on-campus student groups received predominately in-person course delivery prior to the pandemic. ONL-TR students were over six times less likely to report negative educational impact compared to on-campus students, FTIC and OC-TR, while controlling for parent education, income, gender, race/ethnicity, and GPA. Additional survey items further explored this result and were validated with academic records and thematic analysis of students’ text responses. A pre−/post-pandemic comparison revealed that students maintained a similar course load and GPA, despite increased perceptions of a lower GPA during the pandemic. OC-TR students were over two times more likely to express increased concern related to delayed graduation and higher frequency of feeling stress compared to FTIC and ONL-TR students. Meanwhile, low-income students were more likely to report stressors due to the pandemic’s impact on daily life, independent of student type. Taken together, students in this intentionally designed online program were more resilient to the educational and emotional impacts of the pandemic compared to on-campus students. The differences between student groups warn against generalization of student impacts and suggest further research into the positive role of online learning, not just for delivery of educational content and expanding access, but for academic and emotional stability for different student populations.

"Introduction: Long-term cardiovascular (CV) risk is a concern for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) survivors. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the risks of CV mortality and morbidity in DTC survivors compared with the general population. Respective meta-analyses were conducted for data that were adjusted for relevant confounders and crude data. We searched five electronic databases from inception to October 2021, supplemented with a hand search. Two reviewers independently screened citations, reviewed full text articles, extracted data, and critically appraised the studies, with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. The primary outcome was CV mortality. Secondary outcomes included atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. We estimated the relative risk (RR) and confidence intervals [CI] of outcomes using random-effects models (adjusted for age and gender), compared with the general population. Results: We reviewed 3409 unique citations, 65 full text articles, and included 7 studies. CV mortality risk was significantly increased in DTC survivors in one study adjusted for confounders—adjusted RR (aRR) 3.35 ([CI 1.66–6.67]; 524 DTC, 1572 controls). The risk of CV morbidity in DTC survivors, adjusted for risk factors, was estimated as follows: atrial fibrillation—aRR 1.66 [CI 1.22–2.27] (3 studies, 4428 DTC, I2 = 75%), ischemic heart disease—aRR 0.97 [CI 0.84–1.13] (2 studies, 3910 DTC, I2 = 0%), stroke—aRR 1.14 [CI 0.84–1.55] (2 studies, 3910 DTC, I2 = 69%), and heart failure—aRR 0.98 [CI 0.60–1.59] (2 studies, 3910 DTC, I2 = 79%). In meta-analyses of unadjusted data, the risks of CV mortality were not significantly increased but the CV morbidity risks were similar to adjusted data. Conclusions: There is limited evidence suggesting that DTC survivors may be at an increased risk of CV death and atrial fibrillation (after adjustment for confounders). We did not observe a significantly increased risk of ischemic heart disease, stroke, or heart failure. Most analyses were subject to significant heterogeneity and further research, with careful attention to CV risk factors, is needed to clarify CV risk in DTC survivors. ª Mary Ann Liebert, Inc."
"Microblog is an important platform for mining public opinion, and it is of great value to conduct emotional analysis of microblog texts during the current epidemic. Aiming at the problem that most current emotional classification methods cannot effectively extract deep text features, and that traditional word vectors cannot dynamically obtain the semantics of words according to their context, which leads to classification bias, this research put forward a microblog text emotion classification algorithm based on TCN-BiGRU and dual attention (TCN-BiGRU-DATT). First, the vector representation of the text was obtained using ALBERT. Second, the TCN and BiGRU networks were used to extract the emotional information contained in the text through dual pathway feature extraction, to efficiently obtain the deep semantic features of the text. Then, the dual attention mechanism was introduced to allocate the global weight of the key information in the semantic features, and the emotional features were spliced and fused. Finally, the Softmax classifier was applied for emotion classification. The findings of a comparative experiment on a set of microblog text comments collected throughout the pandemic revealed that the accuracy, recall, and F1 value of the emotion classification method proposed in this paper reached 92.33%, 91.78%, and 91.52%, respectively, which was a significant improvement compared with other models. © 2023 by the authors."
"As the core engine of the digital economy, the digital transformation can make modern enterprises survive and develop better now. By the sample data of listed companies in the years from 2015 to 2020, this paper identifies the degree of enterprise digital transformation through text analysis, empirically examines the impact mechanism of digital transformation on corporate risk-taking, and fully considers the heterogeneity problems. The findings are as follows: (1) Digital transformation can improve the level of enterprise risk taking, especially the improvement of enterprise financial stability and strategic risk taking; (2) in terms of enterprise attribute structure, digital transformation can significantly enhance the risk-taking level of non-state-owned enterprises and high-tech enterprises; (3) the mechanism identification test finds that innovation-driven and enterprise value enhancement play a strengthening role in the role of digital transformation in promoting enterprise risk-taking level, and resource allocation efficiency as a mediating path weakens the role of digital transformation on enterprise risk-taking level. This study provides a basis for promoting the improvement of enterprises risk-taking: digital transformation can help enterprises maintain financial stability, improve innovation output capacity, enterprise value level, enterprise risk-taking capacity and sustainable development. At the same time, the Chinese government should take measures to further stimulate the willingness of state-owned enterprises to digital transformation. © 2023 by the authors."
"Doctoral students are expected to contribute to their academic community by presenting their research findings in an internationally acceptable manner and to submit their dissertation. Students from non-English-speaking backgrounds might face challenges when writing publishable papers and dissertations in English. The aim of this study is to explore conceptual metaphors doctoral students used for characterizing their English academic writing experiences during their doctoral studies. A survey was conducted in the spring of 2022 inviting all non-native English-speaking doctoral students. They were asked to finish the sentence: “Writing an academic paper in English is like …..”. A total of 255 doctoral students (125 females; 127 males; 3 not stated) studying at 14 Hungarian universities volunteered to participate. They were from 49 countries and used 52 mother tongues. The metaphor dataset was analyzed following Lakoff and Johnson’ (1980) theoretical framework. Ten conceptual domains emerged from the dataset: WORK, TEXT PRODUCTION, CHALLENGE, STRUGGLE, CHANGING PLACES, ACTIVITIY, NOURISMENT, EASY TASK, CONSTRUCTION, and COMPLEX PROCESS. Only four students shared very negative metaphors on their experiences; whereas most students’ metaphors reflected optimism, even though they implied various demanding features of English academic writing. Students’ metaphors offered new authentic insights into their emic perspectives on their lived experiences. © 2023 The Authors"
"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to exert a significant toll on the Australian primary healthcare system. Although wellbeing challenges faced by hospital-based healthcare workers are widely discussed, less is known about the experiences of general practitioners (GPs) during the initial phases of the pandemic. This paper reports qualitative survey data from Australian GPs, examining their workplace and psychosocial experiences during the initial months of the pandemic. METHODS: An Australia-wide, cross-sectional, online survey of frontline healthcare workers was conducted in 2020. A qualitative approach using content analysis was utilised to examine responses to four free-text questions from GPs. RESULTS: A total of 299 GPs provided 888 free-text responses. The findings reveal that general practice was overlooked and undervalued within the pandemic response, resulting in negative impacts on GP wellbeing. Four themes were identified: (1) marginalisation of GPs; (2) uncertainty, undersupported and undervalued in the workplace; (3) isolation and disrupted personal lives; and (4) strategies to support GPs during times of crises. Key concerns included poor access to personal protective equipment, occupational burnout and poor wellbeing, insufficient workplace support, and conflicting or confusing medical guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Primary healthcare constitutes an essential pillar of the Australian healthcare system. This study presents the many factors that impacted on GP wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Enabling GP voices to be heard and including GPs in decision-making in preparation for future crises will enhance the delivery of primary care, reducing the burden on hospital services, and help sustain a safe and effective health workforce long term."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) is a method used to identify the aspects discussed in a given text and determine the sentiment expressed towards each aspect. This can help provide a more fine-grained understanding of the opinions expressed in the text. The majority of Arabic ABSA techniques in use today significantly rely on repeated pre-processing and feature-engineering operations, as well as the use of outside resources (e.g., lexicons). In essence, there is a significant research gap in NLP with regard to the use of transfer learning (TL) techniques and language models for aspect term extraction (ATE) and aspect polarity detection (APD) in Arabic text. While TL has proven to be an effective approach for a variety of NLP tasks in other languages, its use in the context of Arabic has been relatively under-explored. This paper aims to address this gap by presenting a TL-based approach for ATE and APD in Arabic, leveraging the knowledge and capabilities of previously trained language models. The Arabic base (Arabic version) of the BERT model serves as the foundation for the suggested models. Different BERT implementations are also contrasted. A reference ABSA dataset was used for the experiments (HAAD dataset). The experimental results demonstrate that our models surpass the baseline model and previously proposed approaches. © 2023 by the authors."
"With the current shift in the mass media landscape from journalistic rigor to social media, personalized social media is becoming the new norm. Although the digitalization progress of the media brings many advantages, it also increases the risk of spreading disinformation, misinformation, and malformation through the use of fake news. The emergence of this harmful phenomenon has managed to polarize society and manipulate public opinion on particular topics, e.g., elections, vaccinations, etc. Such information propagated on social media can distort public perceptions and generate social unrest while lacking the rigor of traditional journalism. Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques are essential for developing efficient tools that can detect fake news. Models that use the context of textual data are essential for resolving the fake news detection problem, as they manage to encode linguistic features within the vector representation of words. In this paper, we propose a new approach that uses document embeddings to build multiple models that accurately label news articles as reliable or fake. We also present a benchmark on different architectures that detect fake news using binary or multi-labeled classification. We evaluated the models on five large news corpora using accuracy, precision, and recall. We obtained better results than more complex state-of-the-art Deep Neural Network models. We observe that the most important factor for obtaining high accuracy is the document encoding, not the classification model's complexity. © 2023 by the authors."

"Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease caused by abnormal expansion of unstable CTG repeats in the 3′ untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene. This disease mainly affects skeletal muscle, resulting in myotonia, progressive distal muscle weakness, and atrophy, but also affects other tissues and systems, such as the heart and central nervous system. Despite some studies reporting therapeutic strategies for DM1, many issues remain unsolved, such as the contribution of metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunctions to DM1 pathogenesis. Therefore, it is crucial to identify molecular target candidates associated with metabolic processes for DM1. In this study, resorting to a bibliometric analysis, articles combining DM1, and metabolic/metabolism terms were identified and further analyzed using an unbiased strategy of automatic text mining with VOSviewer software. A list of candidate molecular targets for DM1 associated with metabolic/metabolism was generated and compared with genes previously associated with DM1 in the DisGeNET database. Furthermore, g:Profiler was used to perform a functional enrichment analysis using the Gene Ontology (GO) and REAC databases. Enriched signaling pathways were identified using integrated bioinformatics enrichment analyses. The results revealed that only 15 of the genes identified in the bibliometric analysis were previously associated with DM1 in the DisGeNET database. Of note, we identified 71 genes not previously associated with DM1, which are of particular interest and should be further explored. The functional enrichment analysis of these genes revealed that regulation of cellular metabolic and metabolic processes were the most associated biological processes. Additionally, a number of signaling pathways were found to be enriched, e.g., signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases, signaling by NRTK1 (TRKA), TRKA activation by NGF, PI3K-AKT activation, prolonged ERK activation events, and axon guidance. Overall, several valuable target candidates related to metabolic processes for DM1 were identified, such as NGF, NTRK1, RhoA, ROCK1, ROCK2, DAG, ACTA, ID1, ID2 MYOD, and MYOG. Therefore, our study strengthens the hypothesis that metabolic dysfunctions contribute to DM1 pathogenesis, and the exploitation of metabolic dysfunction targets is crucial for the development of future therapeutic interventions for DM1. © 2023 by the authors."
"Introduction: Brain tumors cause morbidity and mortality in part through peritumoral brain edema. The current main treatment for peritumoral brain edema are corticosteroids. Due to the increased recognition of their side-effect profile, there is growing interest in finding alternatives to steroids but there is little formal study of animal models of peritumoral brain edema. This study aims to summarize the available literature. Methods: A systematic search was undertaken of 5 literature databases (Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PubMed and the Cochrane Library). The generic strategy was to search for various terms associated with “brain tumors”, “brain edema” and “animal models”. Results: We identified 603 reports, of which 112 were identified as relevant for full text analysis that studied 114 peritumoral brain edema animal models. We found significant heterogeneity in the species and strain of tumor-bearing animals, tumor implantation method and edema assessment. Most models did not produce appreciable brain edema and did not test for observable manifestations thereof. Conclusion: No animal model currently exists that enable the investigation of novel candidates for the treatment of peritumoral brain edema. With current interest in alternative treatments for peritumoral brain edema, there is an unmet need for clinically relevant animal models. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Background The majority of Nepalese people are involved in farming. However, due to limited knowledge of zoonoses and poor preventive practices on the part of livestock farmers, vulnerabilities to zoonotic diseases are very high. The main objective of this study was to assess the regional variation in zoonoses-related knowledge and preventive practices of livestock farmers in different ecological regions of Nepal. Material and methods Descriptive cross-sectional quantitative research design was followed in the study. The total sample size was 380 livestock farmers from randomly selected three ecological regions of Nepal. Systematic sampling techniques were applied for data collection. Data were entered into an excel sheet and then imported into Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. The data were calculated using descriptive statistics. Univariate, and bivariate analyses were performed, and the result of the study was presented in the form of text and tables based on their nature. Results Of the studied six zoonotic diseases, most of the respondents (95.8%) knew about zoonotic bird flu; 90.7% of them, were about rabies; and 54.2% knew about swine flu. However, a few respondents knew about bovine tuberculosis, neurocysticercosis, and brucellosis. Ecolog-ically, the highest number of respondents in Nawalpur had knowledge of rabies (95.3%), and swine flu (61.6%), whereas 98.3% of them had knowledge of avian influenza in Tana-hun; and 12.5% of neurocysticercosis in Manang. Regarding zoonoses preventive practices such as regular hand washing with soap water, mask-wearing, gloves, boots, the respon-dents’ representation of 60.8%, 6.6%, 1.8%, and 1.3% respectively in such practices show that although these are easy and cost-effective, personal protective equipment (PPE), such preventive practices were extremely underperformed. Not only that, only 12% of respondents maintain a standard distance (>15m.) between their house and shed. Similarly, 17% still consumed meat from sick animals, and vaccination of livestock was also found poor coverage (36%) in the study. Conclusions Livestock farmers need to be more knowledgeable about many common zoonotic diseases, and their preventive practices still need improvement, with significant regional variation in the study. This has invited various zoonosis threats for them. Therefore, it is recommended that the interventional programs related to common zoonoses be conducted for livestock farmers to solve the problem. © 2023 Bagale et al."
"Background and purpose: The results of various studies on the effect of evening primrose oil (EPO) on cervical ripening are controversial. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effect of EPO on cervical ripening and birth outcomes. Materials and methods: The Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Persian databases were searched for studies published from the inception of the databases up to February 2021 (search updated in May 2022). Full-text articles published in English or other languages, randomized controlled trials, and quasi experimental studies with control group were included. Studies published in form of conference proceedings, and those whose full texts were not available, as well as studies with control groups receiving other treatments for cervical ripening, and those in which the intervention group received drugs besides EPO were all excluded. The Cochrane handbook was used to determine the risk of bias of the included studies. All data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4 and reported in forest plots. Results: Seven trials involving 920 women were included in the meta-analysis. In five studies, including 652 participants, cervical ripening was evaluated using Bishop score. The use of EPO was found to significantly improved Bishop score (MD = 3.23; 95% CI: 3.17, 3.29). The meta-analysis showed no significant differences between two comparison groups in terms of 1-min Apgar score and length of the second stage of labor. However, the two groups were significantly different in terms of their 5-min Apgar score and the time interval between administration of EPO and birth. Based on subgroup analysis by route of administration, both vaginal and oral use of EPO increased Bishop score significantly in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. Conclusion: This study showed that using EPO in term and post-term pregnant women was clinically effective in improving their Bishop score. © 2023"
"The world is facing several challenges, and the problem of sustainable development is one of the most important. It is worth considering that European countries are playing a significant role as pioneers in building a sustainable world, such as those promises made by signing the Paris Agreement and European Taxonomy. To achieve ambitious targets within sustainable development, a huge amount of capital is necessary, while financial and capital market participants are expected to demonstrate a high level of engagement in the domain of sustainability. Facing growing interest and demand, a relatively new product—the ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investment fund—was introduced. Scientific literature is providing some controversial views regarding the overall evaluation of this product. Therefore, additional research providing different angles would contribute to a better understanding. This study examines European ESG funds in the energy sector, from the perspective of news flows and investors. It is worth noting that the authors use the word “European” to refer to members of the European Union (EU). The paper consists of the following parts. In the introduction, the current state of this issue is discussed. The following section offers a literature review and a news flow analysis that contributes to a deeper understanding of these issues. A description of the methodology applied for the data analysis follows this, and the final section presents the research results and conclusions. The authors apply statistical analysis and the Carhart model to determine the differences in the performance of the ESG and conventional funds and use their own tool for text analysis to examine the relevance of the topic of ESG to attract client interest. The authors claim that the performance of the European ESG equity funds do not show a statistically significant difference from the non-ESG equity funds in the majority of the periods examined. The application of the adjusted Carhart model demonstrates that the factor of sustainability has a non-significant and negative effect on the fund performance. Finally, the authors highlight the urgent necessity for the unified usage of keywords and terminology, such as “ESG”, “sustainability”, etc., to ensure comparison and attribution possibilities. © 2023 by the authors."
"Objective To develop a summary format of clinical practice guideline (CPG) recommendations to improve understandability among health care professionals. Methods We developed a summary format based on current research and used the ""Think Aloud""technique in one-on-one cognitive interviews to iteratively improve it. Interviews of health care professionals from Children's Oncology Group-member, National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program sites were conducted. After every five interviews (a round), responses were reviewed, and changes made to the format until it was well understood and no new, substantive suggestions for revision were raised. We took a directed (deductive) approach to content analysis of the interview notes to identify concerns related to recommendation summary usability, understandability, validity, applicability and visual appeal. Results During seven rounds of interviews with 33 health care professionals, we identified important factors that influenced understandability. Participants found understanding weak recommendations more challenging than strong recommendations. Understanding was improved when the term 'conditional' recommendation was used instead of 'weak' recommendation. Participants found a Rationale section to be very helpful but desired more information when a recommendation entailed a practice change. In the final format, the recommendation strength is clearly indicated in the title, highlighted, and defined within a text box. The rationale for the recommendation is in a column on the left, with supporting evidence on the right. In a bulleted list, the Rationale section describes the benefits and harms and additional factors, such as implementation, that were considered by the CPG developers. Each bullet under the supporting evidence section indicates the level of evidence with an explanation and the supporting studies with hyperlinks when applicable. Conclusions A summary format to present strong and conditional recommendations was created through an iterative interview process. The format is straightforward, making it easy for organizations and CPG developers to use it to communicate recommendations clearly to intended users.  © 2023 Santesso et al.

"Neck pain is the fourth leading cause of disability, and is the most common musculoskeletal disorder. High-heel shoes, one of the significant identities of females, cause pain in the neck as well as in feet and ankle regions. The current narrative review was planned to explore evidence to highlight the biomechanical factors of high-heel shoes as the source of neck pain, which mostly remains undiagnosed. PubMed and Google Scholar search engines were explored for full text of research articles published in English language from 2016 to 2021. Of the 82 studies initially found, 22(27%) were shortlisted for full-text assessment, and, of them, 6 (27.27%) were selected for detailed analysis. Despite other contributing factors, kinematics and kinetics should be considered primarily during neck pain management. Based on best available evidence, high heels increase the individual's height, but result in significant decrease in trunk flexion. Evidence also suggests that the type and width of heels do not affect as much as the height of the heels in the context of pain and functional issues in the cervical region. © 2023 Pakistan Medical Association.

"Background: The delivery of quality, safe, and patient-centered care is foundational for professional practice. The primary nursing model allows nurses to have excellent knowledge about patients and families and to plan and coordinate care from admission to discharge, with better management of health situations. Nurses play a crucial role in improving patients’ outcomes, namely those sensitive to nursing care. The knowledge of the relationship between the primary nursing model and the nursing-sensitive outcomes provides new scientific evidence that strengthens the relevance of this nursing care organization model in the inpatients’ health outcomes. This systematic review describes the relationship between nurse-sensitive inpatients’ outcomes and the primary nursing care model. Methods: A systematic review was conducted with a narrative synthesis, and the following databases were searched: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Nursing & Allied Health Collection, SciELO Collections, and Cochrane. Results: A total of 22 full texts were assessed, of which five were included in the study according to the selection criteria. The analysis results indicated that the primary nursing care model was related to nursing-sensitive patient safety outcomes. Patients’ experience was also considered a nursing-sensitive outcome, namely in the satisfaction with nursing care. Conclusion: The negative outcomes are clearly related to the primary nursing care model. There is scarce research that relates primary nursing to positive outcomes, such as patients’ functional status and self-care abilities, and more studies are needed. © 2023 by the authors."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to identify the sentiment of an aspect in a given sentence and thus can provide people with comprehensive information. However, many conventional methods need help to discover the linguistic knowledge implicit in sentences. Additionally, they are susceptible to unrelated words. To improve the performance of the model in the ABSA task, a multi-task sentiment analysis model based on Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) and a Knowledge Graph (SABKG) is proposed in this paper. Expressly, part-of-speech information is incorporated into the output representation of BERT, thereby obtaining textual semantic information through linguistic knowledge. It also enhances the textual representation to identify the aspect terms. Moreover, this paper constructs a knowledge graph of aspect and sentiment words. It uses a graph neural network to learn the embeddings in the triplet of “aspect word, sentiment polarity, sentiment word”. The constructed graph improves the contextual relationship between the text’s aspect and sentiment words. The experimental results on three open datasets show that the proposed model can achieve the most advanced performance compared with previous models. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background: Conflicting findings have described the association between prolonged heart rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) and cardiovascular disease. Aims: To identify articles investigating the association between QTc and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality, and to summarize the available evidence for the general and type 2 diabetes populations. Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase in May 2022 to identify studies that investigated the association between QTc prolongation and cardiovascular disease in both the general and type 2 diabetes populations. Screening, full-text assessment, data extraction and risk of bias assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Effect estimates were pooled across studies using random-effect models. Results: Of the 59 studies included, 36 qualified for meta-analysis. Meta-analysis of the general population studies showed a significant association for: overall cardiovascular disease (fatal and non-fatal) (hazard ratio [HR] 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.33–2.12; I2 = 69%); coronary heart disease (fatal and non-fatal) in women (HR 1.27, 95% CI 1.08–1.50; I2 = 38%; coronary heart disease (fatal and non-fatal) in men (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.26–3.39; I2 = 78%); stroke (HR 1.59, 95% CI 1.29–1.96; I2 = 45%); sudden cardiac death (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.14–2.25; I2 = 68%); and atrial fibrillation (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31–1.83; I2 = 0.0%). No significant association was found for cardiovascular disease in the type 2 diabetes population. Conclusion: QTc prolongation was associated with risk of cardiovascular disease in the general population, but not in the type 2 diabetes population. © 2023 The Authors"
"The treatment of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) requires a multimodal approach combining neoadjuvant radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and surgery. Predicting tumor response to CRT can guide clinical decision making and improve patient care while avoiding unnecessary toxicity and morbidity. Circulating biomarkers offer both the advantage to be easily accessed and followed over time. In recent years, biomarkers such as proteins, blood cells, or nucleic acids have been investigated for their predictive value in oncology. We conducted a comprehensive literature review with the aim to summarize the status of circulating biomarkers predicting response to CRT in LARC. Forty-nine publications, of which forty-seven full-text articles, one review and one systematic review, were retrieved. These studies evaluated circulating markers (CEA and CA 19-9), inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, albumin, and lymphocytes), hematologic markers (hemoglobin and thrombocytes), lipids and circulating nucleic acids (cell-free DNA [cfDNA], circulating tumor DNA [ctDNA], and microRNA [miRNA]). Post-CRT CEA levels had the most consistent association with tumor response, while cfDNA integrity index, MGMT promoter methylation, ERCC-1, miRNAs, and miRNA-related SNPs were identified as potential predictive markers. Although circulating biomarkers hold great promise, inconsistent results, low statistical power, and low specificity and sensibility prevent them from reliably predicting tumor response following CRT. Validation and standardization of methods and technologies are further required to confirm results. © 2023 by the authors."
"Background The internet has become an increasingly important resource for health information, especially for lay people. However, the information found does not necessarily comply with the user’s health literacy level. Therefore, it is vital to (1) identify prominent information providers, (2) quantify the readability of written health information, and (3) to analyze how different types of information sources are suited for people with differing health literacy levels. Objective In previous work, we showed the use of a focused crawler to “capture” and describe a large sample of the “German Health Web”, which we call the “Sampled German Health Web” (sGHW). It includes health-related web content of the three mostly German speaking countries Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, i.e. country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) “.de”, “.at” and “.ch”. Based on the crawled data, we now provide a fully automated readability and vocabulary analysis of a subsample of the sGHW, an analysis of the sGHW’s graph structure covering its size, its content providers and a ratio of public to private stakeholders. In addition, we apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify topics and themes within the sGHW. Methods Important web sites were identified by applying PageRank on the sGHW’s graph representation. LDA was used to discover topics within the top-ranked web sites. Next, a computer-based readability and vocabulary analysis was performed on each health-related web page. Flesch Reading Ease (FRE) and the 4th Vienna formula (WSTF) were used to assess the readability. Vocabulary was assessed by a specifically trained Support Vector Machine classifier. Results In total, n = 14,193,743 health-related web pages were collected during the study period of 370 days. The resulting host-aggregated web graph comprises 231,733 nodes connected via 429,530 edges (network diameter = 25; average path length = 6.804; average degree = 1.854; modularity = 0.723). Among 3000 top-ranked pages (1000 per ccTLD according to PageRank), 18.50%(555/3000) belong to web sites from governmental or public institutions, 18.03% (541/3000) from nonprofit organizations, 54.03% (1621/3000) from private organizations, 4.07% (122/3000) from news agencies, 3.87% (116/3000) from pharmaceutical companies, 0.90% (27/3000) from private bloggers, and 0.60% (18/3000) are from others. LDA identified 50 topics, which we grouped into 11 themes: “Research & Science”, “Illness & Injury”, “The State”, “Healthcare structures”, “Diet & Food”, “Medical Specialities”, “Economy”, “Food production”, “Health communication”, “Family” and “Other”. The most prevalent themes were “Research & Science” and “Illness & Injury” accounting for 21.04% and 17.92% of all topics across all ccTLDs and provider types, respectively. Our readability analysis reveals that the majority of the collected web sites is structurally difficult or very difficult to read: 84.63% (2539/3000) scored a WSTF ≥ 12, 89.70% (2691/3000) scored a FRE ≤ 49. Moreover, our vocabulary analysis shows that 44.00% (1320/3000) web sites use vocabulary that is well suited for a lay audience. Conclusions We were able to identify major information hubs as well as topics and themes within the sGHW. Results indicate that the readability within the sGHW is low. As a consequence, patients may face barriers, even though the vocabulary used seems appropriate from a medical perspective. In future work, the authors intend to extend their analyses to identify trustworthy health information web sites. © 2023 Zowalla et al.

"This paper aims to provide a systematic literature review of sustainable corporate governance to prevent fraud through the tone at the top perspective. In recent years, studies on corporate governance and sustainability have considerably increased. The main aspects of the intersection of these fields were analyzed, especially considering the role of fraud and risk management. Indeed, corporate fraud can hinder corporate sustainability goals. However, to remove fraudulent behavior, rules of conduct, formal recommendations, or the implementation of business ethics programs are often insufficient. In this sense, corporate ethics linked to governance has been referred to as “tone at the top”. Given the significant progress in this area and the lack of a generally accepted theory, an exhaustive organization of the research is needed. Based on these assumptions, this study employed text network analysis to systematically analyze the research contributions collected from the Scopus database for the period 1990–2021. This study establishes networks using the main information of scientific contributions, such as “Abstract”, “Title”, and “Keywords”, and performs analyses, such as co-occurrence and content analyses. The main findings highlight the growing importance of corporate governance in sustainability and propose the emerging role of tone at the top as one of the main drivers of corporate governance sustainability to prevent fraud. We conclude by suggesting some insights derived from the study. The results could be useful for both the academic and professional communities, offering an opportunity for future research. © 2023 by the authors."

"Experiencing pain and insufficient relief can be devastating and negatively affect a patient’s quality of life. Developments in oncology such as new treatments and adjusted pain management guidelines may have influenced the prevalence of cancer pain and severity in patients. This review aims to provide an overview of the prevalence and severity of pain in cancer patients in the 2014–2021 literature period. A systematic literature search was performed using the databases PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Cochrane. Titles and abstracts were screened, and full texts were evaluated and assessed on methodological quality. A meta-analysis was performed on the pooled prevalence and severity rates. A meta-regression analysis was used to explore differences between treatment groups. We identified 10,637 studies, of which 444 studies were included. The overall prevalence of pain was 44.5%. Moderate to severe pain was experienced by 30.6% of the patients, a lower proportion compared to previous research. Pain experienced by cancer survivors was significantly lower compared to most treatment groups. Our results imply that both the prevalence of pain and pain severity declined in the past decade. Increased attention to the assessment and management of pain might have fostered the decline in the prevalence and severity of pain. © 2023 by the authors."
"The amplified development in science and technology has made the lifestyle of human beings fast-paced but much easier at the same time when compared to the previous eras. It is also notable that man has turned the impossible into possible with such advanced technology in various fields such as medicine, education, commerce, and so on. Human beings find it hard to communicate with their family members, friends, and peers because of their hurried mechanical life. Under such circumstances, it is obvious that man does not find time to harmonize with nature. The ancient Hindu writings portray nature as God and emphasize the fact that the worship of nature by humans and treating other living beings with respect maintained the ecological balance. Climate change and the proliferation of numerous pathogens are currently the greatest worries. Such threat-posing viruses not only place human lives in peril but also upset the ecosystem's balance. This paper analyses the select text Mahabharata whi ch is both an ancient literary text and a religious book to highlight the fact that the current ecological imbalance is the result of human indifference to nature. The study throws light on the narratives found in the select text to argue the same and puts forth the measures to attain environmental harmony. © 2023 ACADEMY PUBLICATION."
"Web tables are essential for applications such as data analysis. However, web tables are often incomplete and short of some critical information, which makes it challenging to understand the web table content. Automatically predicting column types for tables without metadata is significant for dealing with various tables from the Internet. This paper proposes a CNN-Text method to deal with this task, which fuses CNN prediction and voting processes. We present data augmentation and synthetic column generation approaches to improve the CNN’s performance and use extracted text to get better predictions. The experimental result shows that CNN-Text outperforms the baseline methods, demonstrating that CNN-Text is well qualified for the table column type prediction. © 2023 by the authors."
"Migrant and refugee youth (MRY) in Australia face specific experiences that inform their sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). Migrant and refugee communities experience poor health outcomes and low service uptake. Additionally, youth are vulnerable to poor sexual health. This review examines the understandings and perspectives of MRY. A systematic review was conducted as per Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The protocol is registered with PROSPERO: CRD42021241213. Nine databases were systematically searched. Inclusion criteria specified literature reporting on migrant and/or refugee youth perspectives and attitudes towards sexual and reproductive health; peer-reviewed qualitative, mixed-methods and/or quantitative studies or grey literature reports; records using Australian research; literature published in English between January 2000 and March 2021. Records that did not report on MRY and did not examine participant views or perspectives; were abstract-only, reviews, pamphlets, protocols, opinion pieces or letters; did not include Australian research; were published before 2000 and/or in a language other than English were excluded. Two reviewers screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles. The Mixed Method Appraisal Tool was used to assess studies' methodological quality. Thematic synthesis methods guided data extraction and analysis. Twenty-eight papers were included in the final review. Three themes were identified in MRY constructions of SRHR: (1) experiences of silence and shame; (2) understandings of and responses to SRHR risks; (3) navigation of relationships and sexual activity. Socioecological factors shaped MRY perspectives at individual, interpersonal, institutional and societal levels. Societal factors and interpersonal relationships significantly influenced decision making."
"Objective: Patient positioning is a matter of ongoing debate in the surgical treatment of vestibular schwannoma (VS). Main endpoints of this discussion are preservation of facial nerve functioning, extent of resection, and complications. In this meta-analysis, we aim to investigate the impact of patient positioning on VS surgery via the retrosigmoid approach. Methods: We searched for eligible comparative trials on PubMed, Cochrane library, and Web of Science. Positioning groups were compared regarding facial nerve outcome, extent of resection, postoperative hydrocephalus, postoperative CSF leaks, perioperative venous air embolism, and perioperative mortality. Two groups of positions were defined, and the following positions were allocated to those groups: (1) Semi-sitting and Sitting-position; (2) Lateral position, supine position with extensive head rotation, lateral oblique (=Fukushima/Three-quarter prone), and park-bench position. Results: From 374 full-text screenings, 7 studies met the criteria and were included in our meta-analysis comprising 1640 patients. Our results demonstrate a significantly better long-term (≥6 months) outcome of the facial nerve after VS surgery in the semi-sitting positioning (OR: 1.49, 95%CI: 1.03-2.15, p = 0.03). Positioning did not influence the extent of resection, rate of postoperative CSF leaks, and the presence of a postoperative hydrocephalus. Overall incidence of venous air embolisms was significantly associated with VS surgery in sitting positioning (OR: 6.77, 95% CI: 3.66-12.54, p < 0.00001). Perioperative mortality was equal among both positioning groups. Conclusion: Semi-sitting positioning seems to be associated with an improved facial nerve outcome after VS surgery via the retrosigmoid approach. Venous air embolisms are significantly more often observed among VS patients who underwent surgery in the sitting position, but the perioperative mortality is equal in both positioning groups. Both positioning groups are a safe procedure. Multicentric prospective randomized trials are needed to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of each positioning in VS surgery via the retrosigmoid approach.

"For decades, Fourth Amendment protections have turned on “reasonable expectations of privacy.” But a new era may be dawning. There is growing interest among judges and scholars in turning away from privacy toward property or positive law as the touchstone for Fourth Amendment protections. Yet many questions remain about how that approach should work, such as where judges should look for positive law and precisely what role positive law should play in Fourth Amendment analysis. This Article answers those questions, and in so doing lays forth a new, comprehensive theory of the Fourth Amendment. We argue that courts should interpret the Fourth Amendment’s protections by looking to “general law”—the common law under the control of no particular sovereign. Courts looking to general law would draw on ancient property concepts such as trespass, license, and bailments in determining the scope of protections. But they would also draw on custom, social practices, and modern legal developments to identify and flesh out common-law rules unknown at the Founding. The general-law approach has numerous advantages over competitor theories. It makes better sense of the Fourth Amendment’s text and has deeper roots in its history. It is surprisingly easy to reconcile with a great deal of Fourth Amendment doctrine, while also suggesting important refinements in various areas. And it gives courts the flexibility to protect Fourth Amendment values in a changing world while also structuring and guiding the judicial task more than an untethered inquiry into privacy expectations. Private law, then, holds the key to understanding the Fourth Amendment’s limits on public power. © 2023, Yale Journal on Regulation. All rights reserved."
"In the originally published version of this manuscript, in Table 3 of the above manuscript, an error was identified with how the table was generated from the underlying databases that resulted in small errors (each <1% in magnitude) in the frequencies and corresponding percentages of: total cases, age-adjusted incidence, sex, and race/ethnicity for several tumor types. Additionally affected were the median ages at diagnoses (with interquartile ranges [IQR]) for these tumor types. Notably, the correct median age at diagnosis for WHO grade 4 IDH-mutant astrocytomas is: 47 years (IQR: 36-60). This error also affected the total count of “Glioblastoma” in Supplemental Table 1, resulting in an error of <3%. The remaining analyses of the manuscript were unaffected, the manuscript’s text was unaffected, and the manuscript’s conclusions remain unchanged.

"This systematic review and meta-analysis was aimed to investigate the conscious sedation efficiency in patients with intellectual disability undergoing dental treatment (PROSPERO CRD42022344292). Four scientific databases were searched by ad-hoc prepared strings. The literature search yielded 731 papers: 426 were selected, 42 were obtained in full-text format, and 4 more were added after hand searching. Fourteen studies were finally included, 11 of which were included in the meta-analysis (random effect model). A high heterogeneity in the drugs used and route of administration was retrieved. Success rate, occurrence of side effects, and deep sedation occurrence were combined to give an overall efficiency of each drug. N2O/O2 reported the highest efficiency (effect size = 0.90; p < 0.01) and proved to be more efficient when used alone. Nine papers reported a success rate of sedation of 80% or more. The prevalence of side effects (6 studies) ranged from 3% to 40%. Enteral and parenteral benzodiazepines showed the same overall efficiency (effect size = 0.86). No meta-analysis has yet been conducted to define the most effective and safest way to achieve conscious sedation in patients with intellectual disability; nitrous oxide appears to be the best choice to perform conscious sedation in patients with intellectual disability undergoing dental treatment. © 2023 by the authors."
"In Denmark, religious behavior is usually very private. Little is known of religious and spiritual needs of patients and family during critical illness and hospitalization. We aimed to explore contemporary thoughts and prayers related to critical illness and hospitalization expressed in hospital chapel Guest Books. Qualitative content analysis of written texts was performed on Guest Books completed from 2005–2019. We identified the main themes of health and illness, life and death, and science and religion. Visitors welcomed the Guest Books as a place to express religious and spiritual thought, even in a nominally nonreligious society. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"China’s religious social services complement the statutory welfare. Clarifying the situations and characteristics of different types of religious social services is conducive to promoting their better integration into public welfare. With the help of existing policy texts, research documents, and website data, this paper employs the thematic framework analysis method to analyze texts and documents and uses NVivo12 and SPSS26 to analyze website data. We explore the similarities and differences between contemporary Chinese Protestant social services and Buddhist social services from the perspectives of the service program, service organizations, and service resources, starting from multiple dimensions such as vertical and horizontal, similarity and difference. The main findings include the following: (a) In terms of service programs, Protestant social services are more inclusive than Buddhist social services and more public in terms of participant selection, religious environment, and the use of spiritual methods. Protestant social services are more open in terms of service value and public expression, while Buddhist social services are more localized and are politically consistent with the government. (b) In terms of service organizations, Protestant social services and Buddhist social services are based on three main types of legal persons. Protestant social services were the first to register organizational legal persons. Protestant social organizations differentiated into special service institutions and have core organizations with strong mobilization capabilities (CCC/TSPM). There is little difference between Protestant and Buddhist social services in private non-enterprise units and foundations (transparency index, business scope). (c) In terms of service resources, both Protestant and Buddhist social services rely on donations. The sources of funds for Protestant social services are more international, diversified, and market-oriented. In terms of government resource acquisition, Protestant social services actively “adapt”, while Buddhist social services passively “rely”. © 2023 by the authors."
"A quantitative X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) study has been undertaken on different experimental data sets of ZrN thin films deposited using reactive Bipolar Pulsed Dual-Magnetron Sputtering (BPDMS) on silicon/stainless steel substates, to obtain dense, pure and homogeneous coatings, free from morphological defects. Zirconium nitride (ZrN) occupies a central role within the class of transition metal nitrides (TMN) for its excellent properties, such as high hardness, low resistivity and chemical/thermal stability when its stoichiometric ratio is 1:1. Many deposition techniques, reported in the literature, tried to obtain oxygen-free and defect-free structures, but they proved a hard task. In this paper it has been demonstrated, using quantitative XPS, that stoichiometric, pure and homogeneous ZrN films have been grown at certain deposition conditions, optimized also via optional accessories mounted on the deposition apparatus. Almost all the films considered for microanalytical characterization resulted as completely oxygen-free, pure (with a lowest-detection limit of 1%) and homogeneous. Apart from these features, a stoichiometric ratio (N/Zr) close to one was calculated for six samples of the ten investigated, with a precision of ± 0.01. In this frame XPS, widely known for being a highly surface-sensitive technique (average depth resolution of 20–30 Å), and powerful for characterizing the chemical composition of materials, has been extensively employed to extract information both in the surface regions and in depth. A cluster ion beam Ar+ 2500 facility on our main XPS chamber has not proved adequate for depth-profiling acquisitions. Therefore, Ar+ ion sputtering was performed instead. To the best of our best knowledge, the results achieved in the present paper possess a level of accuracy never reached before. Rigorous calibration procedures before and during experimental spectrum acquisitions and a careful and scrupulous data processing using software CasaXps v.2.3.24PR1 were carried out to ensure a low percentage error. Progress has also been made for shake-up satellite extraction and interpretation from Zr 3d high-resolution spectra with the help of the literature milestones reported in the text. The total absence of oxygen inside most of the films prevented the formation of zirconium oxide compounds during deposition, which are generally resonant with the binding energy of the shake-up satellite peaks and hide them. A little summary about the experimental shake-up satellite peaks revealed and extracted from the Zr 3d region, after Shirley background subtraction and data processing, will be presented in the last subparagraph of the “Results” section for the ZrN samples analyzed. Figures of Zr 3d deconvoluted spectra for in-depth area analysis have been reported. The quantitative satellite contribution to the Zr 3d total area would not be included in stoichiometric calculations. © 2023 by the authors."
"With increasing costs of healthcare in England and Wales following the COVID-19 pandemic, finding alternatives to traditional medical interventions is more important than ever. Social prescribing provides a way of addressing health and well-being through using non-medical methods that may help relieve costs to the NHS. Evaluating interventions, such as social prescribing, which have high social (but not easily quantifiable) value, can be problematic. Social return on investment (SROI) is a method of assigning monetary values to both social value as well as traditional assets, so provides a way of evaluating social prescribing initiatives. This protocol outlines the steps that will be taken in a systematic review of the SROI literature surrounding social prescribing-type integrated health and social care interventions based in the community in England and Wales. Online academic databases such as PubMed Central, ASSIA and Web of Science will be searched, as will grey literature sources such as Google Scholar, the Wales School for Social Prescribing Research (WSSPR) and Social Value UK. Titles and abstracts from the articles returned by the searches will be reviewed by one researcher. Those selected for full text review will be independently reviewed and compared by two researchers. Where the researchers disagree a third reviewer will help resolve any differences. Information collected will include identifying stakeholder groups, assessing the quality of SROI analyses, identifying intended and unintended changes of social prescribing interventions, and comparing social prescribing initiatives in terms of SROI costs and benefits. Quality assessment will be independently conducted on the selected papers by two researchers. The researchers will discuss to obtain consensus. Where there is disagreement, a third researcher will resolve these cases. A pre-existing quality framework will be developed and used to assess the quality of the literature. © 2023 Hopkins et al.

"This study assumes that linguistic structure plays a significant role in comprehending sentences and texts. It also assumes that the process of learning requires inferences to make connections across and within the local and global discourse contexts. To establish these connections, there is a need of integrating information from prior content of discourse and knowledge or from the reader's schemata to build a coherent memory that represents the events and concepts which describe the texts. To that end, the paper reviews studies on depth-first versus breadth-first models, adopted by the parsers, which address the linguistic structure in sentence and text comprehension. It further examines how the readers’ or listeners’ long-term memory and mental models affect the sentence and text comprehension. The findings of the study show that vocabulary depth and breadth are two important constructs to consider while assessing higher-level processing of reading comprehension. It also shows that having a comprehensive understanding of the gradations of the meaning of a word in a variety of contexts will permit the readers to develop a better understanding of the text, and in turn, to better express themselves. © 2023 ACADEMY PUBLICATION."
"With the advent of the Internet era, Chinese users tend to choose to express their opinions on social media platforms represented by Sina Weibo. The changes in people’s emotions toward cities from the microblogging texts can reflect the image of cities presented on mainstream social media, and thus target a good image of cities. In this paper, we collected microblog data containing “Shanghai” from 1 January 2019 to 1 September 2022 by Python technology, and we used three methods: Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency keyword statistics, Latent Dirichlet Allocation theme model construction, and sentiment analysis by Zhiwang Sentiment Dictionary. We also explore the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on Shanghai’s urban image in the context of the “Shanghai Territorial Static Management”, an important public opinion topic during the COVID-19 epidemic. The results of the study show that the “Shanghai-wide static management” of COVID-19 epidemic has significantly reduced the public’s perception of Shanghai and negatively affected the city’s image. By analyzing the data results, we summarize the basic characteristics of Shanghai’s city image and provide strategies for communicating Shanghai’s city image in the post-epidemic era. © 2023 by the authors."
"Several key challenges are faced during sentiment analysis. One major problem is determining the sentiment of complex sentences, paragraphs, and text documents. A paragraph with multiple parts might have multiple sentiment values. Predicting the overall sentiment value for this paragraph will not produce all the information necessary for businesses and brands. Therefore, a paragraph with multiple sentences should be separated into simple sentences. With a simple sentence, it will be effective to extract all the possible sentiments. Therefore, to split a paragraph, that paragraph must be properly punctuated. Most social media texts are improperly punctuated, so separating the sentences may be challenging. This study proposes a punctuation-restoration algorithm using the transformer model approach. We evaluated different Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models for our transformer encoding, in addition to the neural network used for evaluation. Based on our evaluation, the RobertaLarge with the bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) provided the best accuracy of 97% and 90% for restoring the punctuation on Amazon and Telekom data, respectively. Other evaluation criteria like precision, recall, and F1-score are also used. © 2023 by the authors."
"The risk of vertical transmission from breastfeeding with HIV (BFHIV) has been found to be very low in optimal scenarios with sustained maternal viral suppression during pregnancy and postpartum. Medical providers must account for the risk of this serious adverse event alongside parental autonomy, breastfeeding benefits, and patient values. To assess provider practices, comfort, and challenges with BFHIV, an online mixed-method survey was sent to breastfeeding and HIV provider listservs from June to July 2021. The target population was US medical professionals from diverse practice settings with experience in clinical issues associated with BFHIV, including physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, and lactation consultants. Data analysis utilized nonparametric hypothesis testing, ordinal regression, and reflexive thematic analysis. Most providers reported counseling pregnant people with HIV on infant feeding choices, but fewer specifically endorsed counseling about breastfeeding. Of 84 unique institutions identified by 100 included respondents, 10% had an institutional protocol supporting BFHIV. Institutional protocols were associated with higher degrees of provider comfort with BFHIV in optimal scenario clinical vignettes. Providers perceived that White patients faced fewer BFHIV barriers than patients with other racial identities. Discomfort balancing the goals to protect infants from infection risk and support the parent's role in infant feeding decisions was a key theme in free text responses; this manifested in a spectrum of management styles ranging from patient's informed choice to paternalism. This study highlights the tension providers navigate regarding BFHIV discussions, calling for patient care guidelines and protocols grounded in risk reduction and respect of patient autonomy. © Allison Lai, et al., 2023; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2023."
"Background: In the post-epidemic era, online medical care is developing rapidly, and online doctor teams are attracting attention as a high-quality online medical service model that can provide more social support for patients. Methods: Using online doctor teams on the Haodf.com platform as the research subject, this study investigates the key factors in the process of doctor–patient communication, which affects patients’ emotional well-being. We also explore the different roles played by doctors as leaders and non-leaders in doctor–patient communication. From the perspective of language style, we select representative factors in the process of doctor–patient communication, namely the richness of health vocabulary, the expression of emotions, and the use of health-related terms (including perceptual words and biological words). We extract both team-level and individual-level linguistic communication styles through textual and sentiment analysis methods and empirically analyze their effects on patients’ emotional well-being using multiple linear regression models. Results: The results show that the expression of positive emotions by the team and attention to patients’ perceptions and biological conditions benefit patients’ emotional well-being. Leaders should focus on the emotional expression, whereas non-leaders should focus on the use of perceptual and biological words. Conclusions: This study expands the application of linguistic styles in the medical field and provides a practical basis for improving patients’ emotional well-being. © 2023 by the authors."
"Importance: Large-scale data on type-specific human papillomavirus (HPV) prevalence and disease burden worldwide are needed to guide cervical cancer prevention efforts. Promoting the research and application of health care big data has become a key factor in modern medical research. Objective: To examine the prevaccination prevalence of high-risk HPV (hrHPV) and type distribution by cervical cytology grade in Estonia. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study used text mining and the linking of data from electronic health records and health care claims to examine type-specific hrHPV positivity in Estonia from 2012 to 2019. Participants were women aged at least 18 years. Statistical analysis was performed from September 2021 to August 2022. Main Outcomes and Measures: Type-specific hrHPV positivity rate by cervical cytological grade. Results: A total of 11 017 cases of cervical cytology complemented with data on hrHPV testing results between 2012 and 2019 from 66 451 women aged at least 18 years (mean [SD] age, 48.1 [21.0] years) were included. The most common hrHPV types were HPV16, 18, 31, 33, 51 and 52, which accounted for 73.8% of all hrHPV types detected. There was a marked decline in the positivity rate of hrHPV infection with increasing age, but the proportion did not vary significantly based on HPV type. Implementation of nonavalent prophylactic vaccination was estimated to reduce the number of women with high-grade cytology by 50.5% (95% CI, 47.4%-53.6%) and the number with low-grade cytology by 27.8% (95% CI, 26.3%-29.3%), giving an overall estimated reduction of 33.1% (95% CI, 31.7%-34.5%) in the number of women with precancerous cervical cytology findings. Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study, text mining and natural language processing techniques allowed the detection of precursors to cervical cancer based on data stored by the nationwide health system. These findings contribute to the literature on type-specific HPV distribution by cervical cytology grade and document that α-9 phylogenetic group HPV types 16, 31, 33, 52 and α-7 phylogenetic group HPV 18 are the most frequently detected in normal-to-high-grade precancerous lesions in Estonia."
"Community governance is the “micro-cell” of social governance and the foundation of the governance system. The rational selection logic of community governance policy reflects the value orientation, goal selection, and tool guarantee of governance policy. It is the result of the interaction between government and public values and it reflects the final value choice in the form of policy text and tries to balance policy rationality through accurate calculation. Through the analysis of 100 government work reports and 63 community governance policy documents of the Chinese government from 2013 to 2022, it was found that “People-oriented” was the core value orientation of governance policy. “Better life” was a key target choice for governance policy. “Diversified tools” were an important implementation guarantee for governance policy. These rational choices were consistent between the central and the local governments, but there was a conflict between localities. Urban and rural community governance policies need to establish a public space between policy rationality and value selection to solve the targeting bias of policy rationality in the future. This paper solves the conflict between policy rationality and value choice using the paths of expert think tank construction, highlighting leading goals, and using technology empowerment, to adjust the tension between the two through reasonable value choice and balanced policy rationality, to achieve the goal of urban and rural community governance modernization. © 2023 by the authors."
"Research still does not frequently use the concept of value creation through the application of big data analytics. Additionally, the internet serves as a limitless supply of knowledge that comes from different people all over the world and is delivered in a variety of ways, including text documents, photos, audio files, and video. Search engine is a tool used to find different types of information on the internet. The issue that frequently occurs when looking for information online is that the search results for the intended subject are frequently unrelated to the terms entered. In order to increase the relevance of the data obtained from the search results, the goal of this study is to implement the query expansion approach, which involves reformulating the initial query in order to add several phrases utilizing a thesaurus. The waterfall model was used in conjunction with the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) in the research. The results showed that the creation of a document search engine based on an information retrieval system was able to enhance data relevance and the standard of document search outcomes in big data analysis. The recall results are higher due to the usage of query expansion, which allowed for the retrieval of more pertinent documents. It is clear that by adopting this technique, the relevancy of the data in the search system can be improved. © School of Engineering, Taylor's University."
"Background: Psychoactive substance use and the regulations that govern it both have the potential to lead to harm. A ‘public health approach’ (PHA) is frequently invoked as a means of addressing these harms, but the term is used in inconsistent and contradictory ways. This study systematically reviewed the English-language academic literature to understand how a public health approach to substance use is defined and described. Methods: This review employed thematic synthesis, a methodology designed to rigorously synthesize qualitative evidence. Eligible articles were published in peer-reviewed journals, in the English language, with full text available, and focused primarily on substance use. There were no limits on year of publication. Original research, opinion/commentary, and reviews were included. The searches were conducted in October 2021 in CINAHL, Embase, Medline, PAIS Index, PsycINFO, Scopus, Sociological Abstracts, and Web of Science. Results: 272 articles from 25 countries, published between 1950 and 2021, were synthesized. Definitions of a PHA have changed over time and differ by substance. The most commonly cited characteristics of a PHA were: for alcohol, regulation, e.g. of price and availability (54% of articles); for cannabis: regulation (68%); for illicit drugs: that a PHA is distinct from a criminal justice approach (63%); for opioids: substance use disorder treatment (55%); and for tobacco: regulation (62%). Conclusion: There is no consensus on the definition of a public health approach to substance use, but there is substantial agreement when it comes to PHAs to specific substances. There are also similarities in how they are described for legal substances versus illicit ones. This review found areas of disagreement regarding the extent to which PHAs should focus on individual-level factors. Policymakers, academics, and others developing or implementing PHAs to substance use should be explicit about their aims and objectives – as well as the premises and assumptions underlying them. © 2023 The Author(s)"
"Studies showed that interpreters might differ in performance when it comes to directionality. Nevertheless, limited research has been undertaken concerning the impact of directionality on student interpreters’ performance in consecutive interpreting (CI), a type of interpreting categorised by the working mode. This study aims to investigate the relationship between directionality and performance by adopting a quantitative approach. Four student interpreters from a Chinese university were selected as samples with a homogeneity sampling method. The participants used Chinese as their first language (L1, or A language) and English as a second language (L2, or B language). Analytic rating scales were combined with propositional analysis to assign scores for different aspects of accuracy and completeness in the product of the CI test by student interpreters. To determine the impact of directionality on performance, paired samples t-test was adopted in the current study by testing the significance of the difference between two mean scores of the CI test. The results showed that directionality affected the performance of student interpreters. Overall, the participants performed better in the into-B direction than in the into-A direction. Thus, it is recommended that teachers pay more attention to training listening comprehension ability of the source text in into-A direction. © 2023 ACADEMY PUBLICATION."
"This scoping review mapped and synthesised existing evidence on the influence of individual, parental, peer, and societal-related factors on adolescents’ decisions to use contraception in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Peer-reviewed and review articles published before May 2022, targeting adolescents aged 10–19 years were searched in PubMed, MEDLINE with Full Text via EBSCOhost, PsychINFO via EBSCOhost, CINAHL with Full Text via EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, Science Direct, and Scopus databases. Seven studies were included and analysed using thematic analysis based on the social-ecological model (SEM) and reported using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA). Individual (fear of side effects, fear of infertility), parental (parental disappointment and disapproval), peer (social stigma), partner (association with promiscuity and multiple sexual partners), societal and community (contraceptive use disapproval and stigma), and institutional and environmental factors (lack of privacy and confidentiality) influence contraceptive decisions among adolescents. These also include a lack of accurate information, social exclusion, negative health provider attitudes, and a lack of infrastructure that provides privacy and safe spaces. Identifying and addressing core issues within the context of local cultural practices that restrict contraceptive use is important. Holistic, inclusive approaches that promote the well-being of adolescents must be utilised to provide a conducive environment that ensures privacy, confidentiality, safety, and easy access to contraceptive services. © 2023 by the authors."
"Social media is a platform where people communicate, share content, and build relationships. Due to the current pandemic, many people are turning to social networks such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter, etc., to express their feelings. In this paper, we analyse the sentiments of Indian citizens about the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination drive using text messages posted on the Twitter platform. The sentiments were classified using deep learning and lexicon-based techniques. A lexicon-based approach was used to classify the polarity of the tweets using the tools VADER and NRCLex. A recurrent neural network was trained using Bi-LSTM and GRU techniques, achieving 92.70% and 91.24% accuracy on the COVID-19 dataset. Accuracy values of 92.48% and 93.03% were obtained for the vaccination tweets classification with Bi-LSTM and GRU, respectively. The developed models can assist healthcare workers and policymakers to make the right decisions in the upcoming pandemic outbreaks. © 2023 by the authors."
"Black/African American communities continue to be disproportionately impacted by HIV with Black people with HIV (PWH) exhibiting poorer outcomes along the HIV treatment cascade. Psychosocial burden may, in part, explain these health disparities among PWH. We implemented a culturally adapted intervention [individualized Texting for Adherence Building (iTAB)] to improve ART adherence among 89 Black PWH in San Diego, CA. We aimed to (1) characterize psychosocial risk factors (depression, negative life events, discrimination, medical mistrust) hypothesized to be barriers to HIV outcomes among Black PWH and (2) determine if these factors influence intervention engagement, HIV outcomes, and self-reported physical and mental health. We identified three levels of psychosocial burden (low, moderate, high) through hierarchical cluster analysis. Participants in the high burden cluster (n = 25) experienced the highest levels of depression, negative life events, and discrimination, in addition to the poorest intervention outcomes, HIV outcomes, and physical and mental health compared to low and moderate burden clusters. Participants in the low (n = 29) burden cluster had less medical mistrust than the moderate (n = 34) and high burden clusters, but low and moderate clusters did not differ on any outcomes. Overall, self-reported ART adherence was 83%, which is above estimates of ART adherence in the Western region of the United States. The iTAB intervention shows promise in improving HIV-related outcomes among Black PWH with low to moderate psychosocial burden; however, additional supports may need to be identified for those with high psychosocial burden. © Copyright 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2023."

"Purpose: To systematically collect published research in order to identify and quantify risk factors for delirium in advanced cancer patients. Methods: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, Proquest, CINAHL, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Chinese Wanfang Data, Chinese Periodical Full-text Database (VIP), Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were systematically searched for cohort or case-control studies reporting individual risk factors for delirium among advanced-stage cancer patients published prior to March 2022. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. The pooled adjusted odds ratio (aOR) and its 95% confidence interval were calculated using the RevMan 5.4 software package. Results: A total of 15 studies with data from 3106 advanced cancer patients were included in our analysis. Nine studies were high-quality and six were of moderate quality. Pooled analyses revealed that 11 risk factors were statistically significant. High-intensity risk factors included sleep disturbance, infection, cachexia and the Palliative Prognostic Index; medium-intensity risk factors included male sex, renal failure, dehydration and drowsiness; low-intensity risk factors included age, total bilirubin and opioid use. Antibiotic use was found to have been a protective factor. Conclusions: We identified 12 independent risk factors that were significantly associated with delirium in advanced cancer patients and provide an evidence-based foundation to implement appropriate preventive strategies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"

"Point of interest (POI) recommendation has received significant attention in recent years, most existing studies exploit multiple auxiliary information to alleviate the problem of data sparsity, and consider the sequential features of user mobility. However, few studies consider the category-level characteristics derived from each user's historical check-in frequencies, and the characteristics between different latent factors. In this paper, we exploit category-level multiple characteristics to generate recommendation. First, we obtain the frequency characteristics by in-depth analysis of the historical check-in frequencies for different categories by each user, and propose a scheme including KL-divergence and text analysis algorithm. Then we propose a category-level sequential-and non-sequential influence-Aware probabilistic generative model (CSNS), which models the characteristics (correlation and indeterminate decisiveness) between user latent behavior topics and latent sequence patterns. We design two stages to generate recommendations. In the first stage, CSNS and frequencies characteristics are exploited jointly to recommend the POI categories that users may visit. In the second stage, we depend on user profiles and poi features, and sort the candidate POI sets by combining the POI categories provided in the first stage. Comprehensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing state-of-The-Art POI recommendation models.  © 1989-2012 IEEE."
"The point-vortex system is a system of longstanding interest in nonlinear dynamics, describing the motion of a two-dimensional inviscid fluid that is irrotational except at a discrete set of moving point vortices, at which the vorticity diverges. The leapfrogging orbit consists of two rotating pairs of like-signed vortices which, taken as a quartet, propagate at constant velocity. It is known that if the two pairs are initially widely separated, the motion is stable, while if they are closer together it becomes unstable, with this relation represented by a dimensionless parameter α defined in the text. We here demonstrate analytically that the transition from stability to instability happens at a critical value α=ϕ−2, where ϕ is the golden ratio. This value had been hypothesized based on careful numerics by Tophøj and Aref, and by the present authors using a semi-analytic argument but not previously demonstrated through exact analysis. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"In this paper, based on Sina Weibo data, a natural language processing (NLP) analysis method was used to analyze the temporal and spatial sequence characteristics of people’s attention and the characteristics of text content with the help of microblogs posted by people within 6 days after the 2022 Lushan M6.1, Maerkang M5.8 and Luding M6.8 earthquakes. Moreover, the same analysis method was used on the content of comments on microblogs posted by official media outlets within 6 days after the earthquakes to analyze the changes in people’s sentiments and the differences in the sentiments in various regions, and the influencing factors were also analyzed. The results of this research show the following: In terms of the spatial and temporal distributions, people’s attention was affected by the earthquakes themselves and their social impacts, and the first 2 h was often a period of an outbreak of attention, with the publishing areas mainly concentrated in Sichuan and Guangdong. In terms of people’s sentiments, the overall microblogging sentiment of the three earthquakes was positive, and the sentiment value of the people in Sichuan was generally low compared with that of the people in the other regions. Not only was the fluctuation in sentiment affected by the influence of the region, but it was also positively related to the sentiment of official microblogs. The results of this research provide reference for guiding people’s sentiments after earthquakes in the new media era. © 2023 by the authors."
"Purpose: Understanding what is known about the language profiles of children with hearing loss (CHL) is vital so that researchers and teachers can identify the specific complex syntactic structures that CHL may struggle to master. An understanding of which aspects of complex syntax pose difficulties for CHL is necessary to inform the kind of intervention that will facilitate learning complex syntax for this cohort of children. This scoping review aims to identify what is currently known about the complex syntax use of CHL who communicate through spoken language, and uncover gaps in the literature to guide further research. Method: Ascoping review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews guidelines. The Covidence software was utilized to manage the initial and full-text screening process for the search. Results: From a total of 304 studies, 42 studies were identified that met the eli-gibility criteria. The review highlights the use of broad-based language assess-ments and limited use of specific descriptions of the types of complex syntactic structures and skills. Conclusions: Findings highlight the need for assessment protocols and analysis methods that better support the description of complex syntax profiles for CHL. School-age CHL continue to display challenges with complex syntax development. The review highlighted the need for further research to improve understanding of the complex syntax strengths and vulnerabilities of CHL. Further investigation is needed to better understand their ability to combine ideas and build complexity in their language use, which in turn can inform teaching in schools and interventions for children who require support. © 2023 American Speech-Language-Hearing Association."
"Generalization has always been a keyword in deep learning. Pretrained models and domain adaptation technology have received widespread attention in solving the problem of generalization. They are all focused on finding features in data to improve the generalization ability and to prevent overfitting. Although they have achieved good results in various tasks, those models are unstable when classifying a sentence whose label is positive but still contains negative phrases. In this article, we analyzed the attention heat map of the benchmarks and found that previous models pay more attention to the phrase rather than to the semantic information of the whole sentence. Moreover, we proposed a method to scatter the attention away from opposite sentiment words to avoid a one-sided judgment. We designed a two-stream network and stacked the gradient reversal layer and feature projection layer within the auxiliary network. The gradient reversal layer can reverse the gradient of features in the training stage so that the parameters are optimized following the reversed gradient in the backpropagation stage. We utilized an auxiliary network to extract the backward features and then fed them into the main network to merge them with normal features extracted by the main network. We applied this method to the three baselines of TextCNN, BERT, and RoBERTa using sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection datasets. The results show that our method can improve the sentiment analysis datasets by 0.5% and the sarcasm detection datasets by 2.1%. © 2023 by the authors."
"This paper attempts to examine the genealogical framework of “lamp records” (denglu 燈錄) of the Chan Buddhist tradition using analytical tools and methods of Historical Social Network Analysis (HSNA) and graph theory. As an exploratory study, the primary objectives are to investigate the possibilities offered by HSNA and visualization tools for research on Chan genealogy in lamp records, explore the benefits of this approach over traditional lineage charts, and reflect on its limitations. The essay focuses on the Chan community portrayed in the Goryeo 高麗 edition of the Zutang ji 祖堂集 (Collection of the Patriarchal Hall; K.1503). It shows that the lineage reportedly stemming from Qingyuan Xingsi 青原行思 (d. ca. 740) and Shitou Xiqian 石頭希遷 (701–791), as well as the branch descending from Tianhuang Daowu 天皇道悟 (748–807) to Xuefeng Yicun 雪峰義存 (822–908) and his successors, play a crucial role within the structure of the Zutang ji’s genealogical network. The study further highlights possible irregularities in lineage claims by contrasting metrics of degree and betweenness centrality with features of the text (e.g., number of hagiographic entries, length of the entries). © 2023 by the author."
"Objective: To systematically assess the effectiveness and safety of using acupuncture-moxibustion therapy alone to treat adult overactive bladder (OAB) by taking oral Western medication solely as the control, and to provide evidence-based reference for acupuncture-moxibustion treatment of OAB. Methods: A systemic search was conducted through China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Academic Journal Full-text Database (Wanfang), Chongqing VIP Database (CQVIP), China Biology Medicine Disc (CBM), PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE). RevMan 5.3 was used for meta-analysis. Statistical descriptions were made using standardized mean difference (SMD), confidence interval (CI), and risk ratio (RR). Results: Eight randomized controlled studies were finally recruited and were analyzed after being grouped according to intervention methods. Regarding urinary symptoms, compared with sole use of oral Western medication, acupuncture plus moxibustion can more effectively reduce 24 h urinary frequency [P=0.01, SMD=−0.57, 95%CI (−1.02, −0.12)], 24 h nocturia frequency [P=0.03, SMD=0.49, 95%CI (0.05, 0.94)], and OAB syndrome score (OABSS) [P<0.001, SMD=−3.67, 95%CI (−4.48, −2.86)]. Acupuncture combined with moxibustion and oral Western medication work equivalently in comparing 24 h urinary urgency frequency [P=0.38, SMD=−0.17, 95%CI (−0.57, 0.22)], 24 h urgent incontinence frequency [P=0.25, SMD=0.26, 95%CI (−0.18, 0.70)], and single voiding volume [P=0.22, SMD=1.15, 95%CI (−0.70, 3.00)]. There were no significant differences between acupuncture/electroacupuncture and oral medication in comparing 24 h urinary frequency [P=0.46, SMD=0.07, 95%CI (−0.12, 0.26)], 24 h urinary urgency frequency [P=0.18, SMD=0.70, 95%CI (−1.71, 0.32)], 24 h nocturia frequency [P=0.46, SMD=−0.71, 95%CI (−2.60, 1.17)], 24 h urgent incontinence frequency [P=0.08, SMD=−0.22, 95%CI (−0.48, 0.03)], single voiding volume [P=0.09, SMD=0.17, 95%CI (−0.02, 0.36)], or OABSS [P=0.96, SMD=−0.07, 95%CI (−2.65, 2.52)]. Compared with oral Western medication, moxibustion can more effectively reduce 24 h urinary frequency [P<0.001, SMD=−6.53, 95%CI (−7.65, −5.44)] and 24 h urinary urgency frequency [P<0.001, SMD=−1.6, 95%CI (−2.85, −0.36)]. In comparing the adverse reaction rate, acupuncture-moxibustion was associated with a lower rate compared with oral medication [P=0.002, RR=0.07, 95%CI (0.01, 0.37)], but the difference was statistically insignificant between acupuncture/electroacupuncture and oral medication [P=0.40, RR=0.57, 95%CI (0.16, 2.12)]. Conclusion: Acupuncture-moxibustion is equivalent to the sole use of oral Western medication in improving urinary symptoms in OAB patients and has a higher safety rating. © 2023, Shanghai Research Institute of Acupuncture and Meridian."
"Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified pre-existing challenges to health promotion and care across the world, and particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This qualitative study draws on data from a panel of immunisation experts and uses a novel framework of vaccine delivery domains to explore perspectives from those who live and work in these settings on the challenges to implementing COVID-19 vaccine programs in LMICs. Methods We conducted a thematic content analysis of 96 participant free text replies to questions from Round I of a three-round Delphi consensus study amongst global experts on COVID-19 vaccine implementation. Results Participant responses highlighted challenges to vaccine program implementation including issues related to equity; governance, decision-making, and financing; regulatory structures, planning, and coordination; prioritisation, demand generation, and communication; vaccine, cold chain, logistics, and infrastructure; service delivery, human resources, and supplies; and surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation. Conclusion We reflect on our findings in light of global efforts to address vaccine inequity and emphasise three key areas salient to improving vaccination efforts during novel infectious disease outbreaks: 1) Ensuring safe and sustainable service delivery in communities and at points of care; 2) Strengthening systems for end-to-end delivery of vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and essential supplies; 3) Transforming structural paradigms towards vaccine equity. © 2023 Haldane et al.

"The enrichment of social media expression makes multimodal sentiment analysis a research hotspot. However, modality heterogeneity brings great difficulties to effective cross-modal fusion, especially the modality alignment problem and the uncontrolled vector offset during fusion. In this paper, we propose a bimodal multi-head attention network (BMAN) based on text and audio, which adaptively captures the intramodal utterance features and complex intermodal alignment relationships. Specifically, we first set two independent unimodal encoders to extract the semantic features within each modality. Considering that different modalities deserve different weights, we further built a joint decoder to fuse the audio information into the text representation, based on learnable weights to avoid an unreasonable vector offset. The obtained cross-modal representation is used to improve the sentiment prediction performance. Experiments on both the aligned and unaligned CMU-MOSEI datasets show that our model achieves better performance than multiple baselines, and it has outstanding advantages in solving the problem of cross-modal alignment. © 2023 by the authors."
"Adolescents living with chronic conditions such as HIV (ALHIV) are challenged to remain adherent and engaged in HIV care. Technology offers a promising platform to deliver behaviour-change interventions to adolescents. The largest proportion of ALHIV resides in sub-Saharan Africa; yet little is known about the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of technology-enabled interventions to deliver and support health care to ALHIV in resource-constraint settings. This study aims to explore the literature and synthesise the evidence for the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of technology-enabled health interventions for ALHIV in low and middle-income countries (LMIC). Eight electronic databases (Ebscohost, CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, PubMed, SCOPUS, Science Direct, and Sabinet) and Google Scholar will be searched to identify technology-enabled health interventions for ALHIV in LMIC published from 2010–2022. Quantitative and qualitative studies reporting on technology-enabled health interventions for predominantly adolescents (10–19 years) will be included. The review will be performed, and findings reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses Protocols. A two-stage process of screening titles and abstracts, and then full-text, will be performed independently by two reviewers. The quality of the included studies will be assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists, and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions tool will be used to assess the risk of bias. The review will involve publications already in the public domain; therefore, ethics approval is not required. The results will be disseminated through a peer-reviewed journal publication and/or conference proceedings. Copyright: © 2023 Crowley et al.

"Authorship profiling is a subtask of authorship identification. This task can be regarded as an analysis of personal writing styles, which has been widely investigated. However, no previous studies have attempted to analyze the authorship of classical Chinese poetry. First, we provide an approach to evaluate the popularity of poets, and we also establish a public corpus containing the top 20 most popular poets in the Tang Dynasty for authorship profiling. Then, a novel poetry authorship profiling framework named multidimensional domain knowledge poet profiling (M-DKPP) is proposed, combining the knowledge of authorship attribution and the text’s stylistic features with domain knowledge described by experts in traditional poetry studies. A case study for Li Bai is used to prove the validity and applicability of our framework. Finally, the performance of M-DKPP framework is evaluated with four poem datasets. On all datasets, the proposed framework outperforms several baseline approaches for authorship attribution. © 2023 by the authors."
"BACKGROUND: Previous studies have tried to determine the relationship between sexting and risky behaviour to discover whether sexting fits into a deviance or normalcy discourse. This study investigated the relationship between sexting and sexual risk behaviours, contraception use and gender. METHODS: The design was a cross-sectional analysis of data from the sixth National Survey of Secondary Student and Adolescent Sexual Health, collected in 2018. There were 8263 Australian adolescents (aged 14-18years). Participants were fairly evenly split by gender, and 73% identified as heterosexual. Participants were asked a series of questions about their engagement in sexting, sexual behaviour and sexual health behaviours. RESULTS: A total of 52% of participants had sent a sext in the previous 2months, with most being text-based sexts. Sexters were 3.29times more likely to have engaged in anal or vaginal intercourse, and 2.88times more likely to have gotten pregnant than non-sexters. Sexters (M =2.76) had significantly more partners than non-sexters (M =2.35), t (3763)=-10.99, P X 2 (1)=0.38, P =0.535, or contraceptive use based on sexting status. CONCLUSIONS: Sexters are more likely to have engaged in sexual intercourse and have more partners than non-sexters. Sexting is not strongly associated with other risky behaviours. Evidence for differences between sexters and non-sexters in protecting against STIs and pregnancy was not found, as there were no significant differences in contraceptive use."
"A critical aspect of coronary heart disease (CHD) care and secondary prevention is ensuring patients have access to evidence-based information. The purpose of this review is to summarise the guiding principles, content, context and timing of information and education that is beneficial for supporting people with CHD and potential communication strategies, including digital interventions. We conducted a scoping review involving a search of four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, Medline) for articles published from January 2000 to August 2022. Literature was identified through title and abstract screening by expert reviewers. Evidence was synthesised according to the review aims. Results demonstrated that information-sharing, decision-making, goal-setting, positivity and practicality are important aspects of secondary prevention and should be patient-centred and evidenced based with consideration of patient need and preference. Initiation and duration of education is highly variable between and within people, hence communication and support should be regular and ongoing. In conclusion, text messaging programs, smartphone applications and wearable devices are examples of digital health strategies that facilitate education and support for patients with heart disease. There is no one size fits all approach that suits all patients at all stages, hence flexibility and a suite of resources and strategies is optimal. © 2023 by the authors."
"The world is facing a new era in which social media communication plays a fundamental role in people's lives. Along with proven benefits, several collateral drawbacks have risen, one being the widespread of false information with malicious intents, oftentimes using anonymous or false identities. Fighting this problem is challenging, especially when considering the nature of text messages involved on social media platforms: a sea of small messages and a myriad of users. Attributing the authorship of such messages is an ambitious endeavor; nevertheless, it is a way to fight this undesired disinformation scenario. In this work, we tackle the problem of authorship attribution of tiny messages, but, different from what has been done with longer texts, we rely upon data-driven approaches, avoiding handcraft features and harnessing recent advances of deep neural networks in the field of pattern recognition. By modeling small texts employed in social media as unidimensional signals, we propose a deep learning model to project these messages onto a manifold suitable for the task of authorship attribution. We provide two state-of-the-art solutions tailored for different setups and strategies for the scenario of authorship verification. These advances were possible, thanks to three additional contributions: an updated dataset based on the Twitter® platform, new sanitization techniques to improve the quality of the training data, and novel visual analytics techniques to help the development of authorship attribution solutions.  © 2014 IEEE."
"INTRODUCTION: Evidence about predictors of poor outcomes such as cerebral infarction (CI) after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) has not been fully elucidated. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on studies with adults with aSAH considering RCT and non-RCT, prospective, and retrospective cohort studies describing clinical, imaging as well as angiographic studies in patients with aSAH. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: After reviewing the complete text, 11 studies were considered eligible, out of which four were ruled out. Degree of clinical severity was the most predictive factor with a higher degree at the presentation on different severity scales being associated with a statistically significant increasing the risk of suffering a CI following aSAH (OR 2.49 [95% CI 1.38-4.49] P=0.0003). Aneurysm size increased the risk of CI (OR 1.49 [95% CI 1.20-1.85] P=0.0003; I2=4%). In six studies analyzed, it was found that an important factor for the subsequent development of CI is vasospasm (OR 7.62 [2.19, 26.54], P=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The development of vasospasm is a risk factor for CI development after aSAH. In our review, three factors were associated with an increased risk of CI: clinical severity at presentation, vasospasm, and aneurysm size. The major limitation of this meta-analysis is that included studies were conducted retrospectively or were post hoc analyses of a prospective trial. © 2022 Edizioni Minerva Medica."
"Background: Rotator cuff tears are a common source of shoulder pain and dysfunction. An irreparable rotator cuff tear poses a particular treatment challenge. There have been few studies reporting the outcomes of lower trapezius tendon (LTT) transfer for irreparable rotator cuff injuries. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to summarize the postoperative functional outcomes and complications of patients undergoing a LTT transfer for massive irreparable rotator cuff injuries. Methods: A scoping review was performed using the Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar databases with the search terms “trapezius” AND “transfer.” Of 362 studies included for initial screening, 37 full-text citations were reviewed, with 5 studies meeting all the inclusion criteria to be included in the review. Two reviewers extracted data on study design, patient demographics, surgical technique, functional outcomes, range of motion (ROM), and complications for each study according to the predefined criteria. Results: Improvements in the preoperative to postoperative functional status, identified using the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (50.34 to 18), The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons Score (48.56 to 80.24), Visual Analog Scale (5.8 to 1.89), Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (34.22 to 69.86), and Subjective Shoulder Value (52.24 to 77.66), were evident across all 5 studies. Preoperative to postoperative increases in ROM were seen for flexion (85 to 135), external rotation (18 to 52), and abduction (50 to 98). The overall complication rate was 18%, with seroma formation (8%) as the most common postoperative complication. Discussion/Conclusion: Our analysis showed that LTT transfer improved postoperative function, ROM, and pain for patients with irreparable rotator cuff tears with an overall complication rate of 18%. Future controlled studies are required to directly compare LTT transfer to other tendon transfers and other surgical techniques for irreparable rotator cuff tears. © 2022 The Authors"
"The promotion of community governance by digital means is an important research topic in developing smart cities. Currently, community governance is mostly based on reactive response, which lacks timely and proactive technical means for emergency monitoring. The easiest way for residents to contact their properties is to call the property call center, and the call centers of many properties store many speech data. However, text sentiment classification in community scenes still faces challenges such as small corpus size, one-sided sentiment feature extraction, and insufficient sentiment classification accuracy. To address such problems, we propose a novel community speech text sentiment classification algorithm combining two-channel features and attention mechanisms to obtain effective emotional information and provide decision support for the emergency management of public emergencies. Firstly, text vectorization based on word position information is proposed, and a SKEP-based community speech–text enhancement model is constructed to obtain the corresponding corpus. Secondly, a dual-channel emotional text feature extraction method that integrates spatial and temporal sequences is proposed to extract diverse emotional features effectively. Finally, an improved cross-entropy loss function suitable for community speech text is proposed for model training, which can achieve sentiment analysis and obtain all aspects of community conditions. The proposed method is conducive to improving community residents’ sense of happiness, satisfaction, and fulfillment, enhancing the effectiveness and resilience of urban community governance. © 2023 by the authors."
"Aims/Hypothesis: Only 51% of patients with type 2 diabetes achieve the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <7% target. Mind and body practices have been increasingly used to improve glycemic control among patients with type 2 diabetes, but studies show inconsistent efficacy. The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between mind and body practices, and mean change in HbA1c and fasting blood glucose (FBG) in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: The authors conducted a literature search of Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov seeking through June 10, 2022, published articles on mind and body practices and type 2 diabetes. Two reviewers independently appraised full text of articles. Only intervention studies were included. Reviewers extracted data for meta-analysis. Restricted maximum likelihood random-effects modeling was used to calculate the mean differences and summary effect sizes. The authors assessed heterogeneity using Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. Funnel plots were generated for each outcome to gauge publication bias. Weighted linear models were used to conduct study-level meta-regression analyses of practice frequency. Results: The authors identified 587 articles with 28 meeting the inclusion criteria. A statistically significant and clinically relevant mean reduction in HbA1c of -0.84% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.10% to -0.58%; p < 0.0001) was estimated. Reduction was observed in all intervention subgroups: mindfulness-based stress reduction: -0.48% (95% CI: -0.72% to -0.23%; p = 0.03), qigong: -0.66% (95% CI: -1.18% to -0.14%; p = 0.01), and yoga: -1.00% (95% CI: -1.38% to -0.63%; p < 0.0001). Meta-regression revealed that for every additional day of yoga practice per week, the raw mean HbA1c differed by -0.22% (95% CI: -0.44% to -0.003%; p = 0.046) over the study period. FBG significantly improved following mind and body practices, with overall mean difference of -22.81 mg/dL (95% CI: -33.07 to -12.55 mg/dL; p < 0.0001). However, no significant association was found between the frequency of weekly yoga practice and change in FBG over the study period. Conclusions/Interpretation: Mind and body practices are strongly associated with improvement in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The overall mean reduction in HbA1c and FBG was clinically significant, suggesting that mind and body practices may be an effective, complementary nonpharmacological intervention for type 2 diabetes. Additional analyses revealed that the mean decrease in HbA1c was greater in studies requiring larger number of yoga practice sessions each week. © Copyright 2023, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2023."
"(1) Background: Research has shown that patients with mental health diagnoses experience less anxiety and depressive symptoms and higher levels of ‘well-being’ when they spend time in natural environments as part of their treatment. It has been suggested that there is a relationship between the outdoor settings and the recovery of psychiatric patients. Recovery describes an individual process, which can vary from person to person. (2) Methods: This scoping review examined the relationship between the physical environment and the recovery of psychiatric patients. Systematic searches in three online databases, namely Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO, were performed using a selection of psychiatric, environmental, and recovery terms and included both quantitative and qualitative studies. In general, ‘well-being’ serves as an overarching indicator when it comes to research on how outdoor settings can affect mental health. Well-being was expressed in terms of mood, social relations, and autonomy. (3) Results: A total of 8138 records were screened, 85 studies were included for full-text reading, and five articles were included in the final analysis. The review showed in general that outdoor settings, more specifically gardening, contact with nature, and a safe environment can be related to the well-being of patients on psychiatric wards. (4) Conclusions: The five reviews allow us to conclude that outdoor settings can be seen as a comprehensive resource for mental health. © 2023 by the authors."
"Through rapid advances, vertical farming (VF) systems are becoming an addition to conventional agricultural practices that under increasing climate stress can contribute to more sustainable food production. The present research advances extant consumer research on VF by exploring how consumers associate the different characteristics of VF with the technology's pros and cons, and how these link to their personal values. To this end, consumers’ cognitive structures relating to VF were uncovered through means-end chains (MECs) and laddering methodology. While both soft and hard laddering approaches remain in use, innovation and methodological development are focused on hard laddering. The present research contributes to this expansion by trailing a hybrid-hard laddering approach that is suitable for online surveys and large sample sizes while incorporating some aspects of soft laddering. Participants lived in Singapore (SG) (n = 547) or Germany (DE) (n = 537) and completed the laddering task after reading an information text about VF. Data analysis resulted in hierarchical value maps (HVM) which were compared by country and groups of participants with different attitudes to VF. Both altruistic and self-centred motives were key to acceptance of VF while energy use emerged as a concern. For some consumers positive linkages were established to “pleasure and enjoyment” and this may be harnessed to enhance uptake. The hybrid-hard laddering approach was successful in so far as the results fitted expectations. However, room for improvement exists. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Purpose: To systematically examine and summarize the current evidence regarding the effects of virtual reality (VR) on physical, cognitive, and psychological outcomes in cancer rehabilitation. Methods: Six bioscience and engineering databases were searched. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of 2397 records and retrieved 25 full-text articles. Inclusion criteria included patients with a current or previous diagnosis of cancer; VR was used as an intervention for physical, cognitive, or psychological impairments and functional limitations; and clinical trials with at least two arms and with both pre- and post-intervention assessments. Reviewers assessed methodological quality using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Results: Seventeen studies including 799 patients with cancer were identified. Within-group pooled analysis indicated that patients demonstrated significant improvement in pain (P < 0.001), fatigue (P < 0.001), anxiety (P < 0.001), upper extremity function (P < 0.001), and quality of life (P = 0.008) after VR intervention. Between-group pooled analysis indicated significant improvements with VR in pain (P = 0.004), anxiety (P < 0.001), and upper extremity function (P < 0.001) compared with the control. Three studies reported the positive effects of VR on cognition. Conclusions: VR demonstrates promising effects in physical, cognitive, and psychological aspects of patients with cancer. VR can be incorporated into a comprehensive cancer rehabilitation program to alleviate impairments and functional limitations. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Objective: To assess which interventions are effective in reducing fluid absorption at the time of hysteroscopy.DATA SOURCE: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, PubMed (non-MEDLINE records only), EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), ClinicalTrials.gov, and Web of Science were searched from inception to February 2022 without restriction on language or geographic origin.METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, all English-language, full-text articles reporting fluid balance, with an intervention and comparator arm, were included. Title and abstract screening and full-text review were completed independently by two authors. Conflicts were resolved through discussion and consensus. Studies' risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies.TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: The search identified 906 studies, 28 of which were eligible for inclusion, examining the following interventions: gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist; ulipristal acetate; vasopressin; danazol; oxytocin; and local, general, and regional anesthesia. A significant reduction in mean fluid absorption was seen in patients preoperatively treated with danazol (-175.7 mL, 95% CI -325.4 to -26.0) and a GnRH agonist (-139.68 mL, 95% CI -203.2, -76.2) compared with patients in a control group. Ulipristal acetate and type of anesthesia showed no difference. Data on type of anesthesia and vasopressin use were not amenable to meta-analysis; however, four studies favored vasopressin over control regarding fluid absorption. Mean operative time was reduced after preoperative treatment with ulipristal acetate (-7.1 min, 95% CI -11.31 to -2.9), danazol (-7.5 min, 95% CI -8.7 to -6.3), and a GnRH agonist (-3.3 min, 95% CI -5.6 to -0.98). Conclusion: Preoperative treatment with a GnRH agonist and danazol were both found to be effective in reducing fluid absorption and operative time across a range of hysteroscopic procedures. High-quality research aimed at evaluating other interventions, such as combined hormonal contraception, progestin therapy, and vasopressin, are still lacking in the literature.  © 2023 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists."
"The Semantic Coherence Dataset has been designed to experiment with semantic coherence metrics. More specifically, the dataset has been built to the ends of testing whether probabilistic measures, such as perplexity, provide stable scores to analyze spoken language. Perplexity, which was originally conceived as an information-theoretic measure to assess the probabilistic inference properties of language models, has recently been proven to be an appropriate tool to categorize speech transcripts based on semantic coherence accounts. More specifically, perplexity has been successfully employed to discriminate subjects suffering from Alzheimer Disease and healthy controls. Collected data include speech transcripts, intended to investigate semantic coherence at different levels: data are thus arranged into two classes, to investigate intra-subject semantic coherence, and inter-subject semantic coherence. In the former case transcripts from a single speaker can be employed to train and test language models and to explore whether the perplexity metric provides stable scores in assessing talks from that speaker, while allowing to distinguish between two different forms of speech, political rallies and interviews. In the latter case, models can be trained by employing transcripts from a given speaker, and then used to measure how stable the perplexity metric is when computed using the model from that user and transcripts from different users. Transcripts were extracted from talks lasting almost 13 hours (overall 12:45:17 and 120,326 tokens) for the former class; and almost 30 hours (29:47:34 and 252,270 tokens) for the latter one. Data herein can be reused to perform analyses on measures built on top of language models, and more in general on measures that are aimed at exploring the linguistic features of text documents. © 2022 The Authors"
"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine whether targeting a higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) compared with a lower MAP in adults with shock results in differences in patient important outcomes. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov through May 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Titles and abstracts were screened independently and in duplicate to identify potentially eligible studies, then full text for final eligibility. We included parallel-group randomized controlled trials in adult patients with a diagnosis of shock requiring vasoactive medications. The higher MAP group was required to receive vasoactive medications to target a higher MAP as established by study authors, whereas the lower MAP group received vasoactive medications to target lower MAP. DATA EXTRACTION: In triplicate, reviewers independently extracted data using a prepiloted abstraction form. Statistical analyses were conducted using the RevMan software Version 5.3. DATA SYNTHESIS: Six randomized controlled trials (n = 3,690) met eligibility criteria. Targeting a higher MAP (75-85 mm Hg) compared with lower MAP of 65 mm Hg resulted in no difference in mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.06; 95% CI, 0.98-1.15; I2= 0%; p = 0.12; moderate certainty. Targeting a higher MAP resulted in no difference in the risk of undergoing renal replacement therapy (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.83-1.11; I2= 24%; p = 0.57; moderate certainty); however, a subgroup analysis comparing patients with and without chronic hypertension demonstrated that a higher MAP may reduce the risk of undergoing renal replacement therapy (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.71-0.98; I2= 0%; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated with moderate certainty that there is no difference in mortality when a higher MAP is targeted in critically ill adult patients with shock. Further studies are needed to determine the impact of mean arterial pressure on need for renal replacement therapy in this population. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins. All rights reserved."
"Internet-based media and online business make people use it a lot, especially the high use of cell phones everywhere in the world. These encourage organizations to gain insights from people far away. This creates a tremendous growth of information on the Internet. Concepts are important implications for practically all human practices and practices. It looks for feelings before making a decision. People share their opinions, thoughts, ideas, attitudes, feelings etc. with known languages on social media platform. Most people express their opinions in mixed languages (English with their mother tongue). Analyzing diverse texts is a very challenging area for practitioners and researchers. In this research work, it presents an ensemble technique by collaborating Generative Adversarial network (GAN) and Self-Attention Network (SAN) to analyze the tweets that contains diversified languages. The GAN layer helps to arrange the preprocessed tweets into positive and negative. The SAN layer helps to identify the neutral tweets. The proposed technique is compared along with the existing Concurrent Neural Network (CNN) along with Self-Attention Network (SAN) on Tanglish tweets. The proposed work produced better accuracy than the existing work. © 2023 The Authors"
"Clinical coding is the process of converting health information, which may be a combination of free text language and a clinician's interpretation of this, into a computer-readable formal language. Well-known examples of clinical coding systems include the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). These coding systems exist to avoid the complexities and ambiguity of human language and convey benefit to both individual clinicians and patients, but also by allowing for data analysis at the scale of entire populations. Advantages to proper clinical coding for individual hospitals or practices include audit, research, creation of decision support systems, accurate communication between teams, and to ensure hospitals receive appropriate re-numeration for their services. At the national level such coding allows for epidemiological study and the strategic allocation of health resources, whilst at the international level clinical coding allows for statistical reporting, monitoring of health inequality, and unambiguous communication between countries in a common language. © 2022"
"Introduction: Healthcare providers and organizations occasionally use electronic messages to provide information to patients. There is insufficient data on whether patients actually read the emails they receive. In this study, we aimed to assess the cooperation of patients in reading multiple information pages sent over 6 months from their diabetologist via email. Methods: Adults with non-optimally controlled type 2 diabetes received via email, once every 2 weeks for 6 months, a message containing information and tips on how to improve diabetes control through lifestyle choices. The information was provided in a format that required the recipient to actively click on a “read more” tab in order to reveal the entire text. Each email contained a short questionnaire requesting a response. Analysis compared the effect of patient variables on co-operation with reading the emails and answering the questionnaires. Main findings: 45 patients completed the study, 53.3% of them read 66–100% of the emails, 17.8% read 34–65% of the emails and only 26.7% read less than 33% of the emails. Women answered more questionnaires than men did. Answering a questionnaire on nutrition or medications correlated with reading the following email sent. Conclusions: This study is the first to demonstrate that most patients do indeed read a significant portion of emails sent by their physician. Email could be an effective means of sharing information and improving patient engagement with treatment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"In China, vehicles with L2 driving automation are already widespread, while L3-L5 automated vehicles (AVs) are not allowed on the road. Surprisingly, crashes involving vehicles with L2 driving automation contributed to the public's discussion of L3-L5 AVs. Understanding the variations in public perception of AVs is imperative, which could significantly affect the future evolution of AVs. Respondents have few opportunities to express their views freely in survey-based studies relying on structured questionnaires (e.g., Likert scale). We collected 42,111 comments from Chinese mainstream social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Tik Tok) in August 2021 and applied advanced text mining technology (Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model, text network analysis, and sentiment analysis) to understand variations in public perception of AVs before and after the crashes. The results show that the public expresses more blame for vehicles with L2 driving automation than human drivers and has misunderstandings about the current development of L3-L5 AVs, which is closely connected with publicity from automobile companies and media. Women were more negative than men both before and after the crash, and the sentiment difference was most significant in the first three days of the crash. This research provides new ideas for a timely understanding of the public perception of AVs. Findings contribute to specific policy recommendations to help in the technological change and wider adoption of AVs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"This article examines the differential impact of variances in the quality and taste comments found in online customer reviews on firm sales. Using an analytic model, the authors show that although increased variance in consumer reviews about taste mismatch normally decreases subsequent demand, it can increase demand when mean ratings are low and/or quality variance is high. In contrast, increased variance in quality always decreases subsequent demand, although this effect is moderated by the amount of variance in tastes. Since these theoretical demand effects are predicated on the assumption that consumers can differentiate between the two sources of variation in ratings, the authors conduct a survey to test this assumption, demonstrating that participants are indeed able to reliably distinguish quality from taste evaluations in two subsets of 5,000 reviews taken from larger data sets of reviews for 4,305 restaurants and 3,460 hotels. The authors use these responses to construct sets of reviews that they use in a controlled laboratory experiment on restaurant choice, finding strong support for the theoretical predictions. These responses are also used to train classifiers using a bag-of-words model to predict the degree to which each review in the larger data sets relates to quality and/or taste, allowing the authors to estimate the two types of review variances. Finally, the authors estimate the effects of these variances in overall ratings on establishment sales, again finding support for the theoretical results. © American Marketing Association 2022."
"Background: Nutrition and physical activity are associated with prostate cancer recurrence and mortality. Few randomized controlled trials (RCT) have examined the effects of long-term exercise and diet changes on prostate cancer clinical, biological, and patient-reported outcomes. Methods: Prostate 8-II is a 4-arm RCT among 200 men with prostate cancer who chose radical prostatectomy (RP) as their primary treatment. Men are enrolled prior to RP and randomized to exercise-only, diet-only, exercise + diet, or usual care (50/arm). Participants begin their assigned intervention 0–5 weeks prior to RP and continue for 24-months following surgery. The 3 active intervention arms receive access to a web-portal and text messages, coaching calls, and other intervention resources (e.g., heart rate sensor and resistance bands and/or recipe booklet). Weekly exercise goals for the exercise intervention groups are 150 min moderate or 75 min vigorous aerobic exercise, 2 strength sessions, and 2 flexibility sessions. Diet intervention groups work with a dietitian to customize their goals (e.g., increase cruciferous vegetables, cooked tomatoes, healthy fats, fish; limit processed meats, whole milk). The primary endpoint is biochemical recurrence. Secondary endpoints include change in tumor biomarkers from biopsy to RP as well as patient-reported outcomes (e.g., quality-of-life), blood and urine biomarkers, and anthropometry at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months. Conclusion: This 4-arm RCT will examine the impact of change in exercise and diet (alone or in combination) on prostate cancer recurrence, biology, and quality-of-life. © 2023"
"Background: This review’s goals were to investigate apremilast’s efficacy versus placebo in palmoplantar psoriasis (PP) and palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP), and apremilast’s efficacy versus methotrexate in PP. Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, clinicaltrials.gov, and Embase in July 2022. Publications investigating subjects with PP or PPP, treated with apremilast, which reported palmoplantar-specific outcomes were used. Exclusion criteria included cases of drug-induced PP/PPP, case studies, non-English texts, omission of palmoplantar-specific outcomes, and incomplete publications. Studies were assessed for risk of bias using Cochrane Review Manager application and CASP checklist. Primary endpoints were a 50% improvement of the Palmoplantar Psoriasis/Pustulosis Area and Severity Index (PPPASI 50) and improvement of the Palmoplantar Physician Global Assessment (PPPGA) to 0 or 1 in patients with baseline PPPGA ≥ 3. Results: Seventeen original studies including five placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs), one phase II clinical trial, two randomized methotrexate comparative trials, six cohort studies, and three case series were analyzed, totaling 1117 participants. Meta-analysis of four placebo-controlled RCTs investigating PP found apremilast treatment to be superior to placebo in achieving a PPPGA of 0/1 (baseline PPPGA of ≥ 3) after 16 weeks of treatment (n = 244; OR = 2.69 [1.39–5.22]). Apremilast was superior to placebo in achieving PPPASI 50 at week 16 in the only placebo-controlled RCT of PPP (78.3 vs. 40.9%) [P = 0.0003]. Apremilast was comparable to methotrexate in achieving PPPASI 50 at week 16 in PP (59.5 vs. 64.3%; n = 84; [P = 0.65]). Non-randomized studies generally showed marked improvement in PPPASI, PPPGA, and DLQI scores following apremilast treatment. Discussion: Apremilast treatment in PP and PPP resulted in significant improvement in objective, palmoplantar-specific clinical parameters versus placebo, and comparable efficacy with methotrexate in PP. Limitations in interpreting these results include variations in palmoplantar-specific metrics used and risk of bias of included studies. © 2023, The Author(s)."
To improve the accuracy of the static membrane deflection calculation for the collapse mode capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) fabricated by sacrificial release (SR) method. The beam theory was used and the substrate supporting force can be modeled by a coefficient to the load on the membrane. The surrounding supporting post bending can be modeled by applying the elastic support boundary conditions (ESBCs) for the peripheral part of the membrane. CMUT devices have been fabricated using the SR process to validate this analytical analysis. Young's modulus of \text {Si}-{{3}} \text {N}-{{4}} was derived as 200 GPa by a method using center deflections of several different radii single-layer conventional devices under 1 atm. The analytical deflection results and contact radius results for the collapse mode CMUT membranes were testified by experimental results under 1 atm and were found matching the experimental results. This showed that the analysis can provide improved results for SR fabricated CMUT devices by including the substrate supporting effect and the post bending effect.  © 2001-2012 IEEE.
"Objectives: To explore indicators of the following questionable research practices (QRPs) in randomized controlled trials (RCTs): (1) risk of bias in four domains (random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, and blinding of outcome assessment); (2) modifications in primary outcomes that were registered in trial registration records (proxy for selective reporting bias); (3) ratio of the achieved to planned sample sizes; and (4) statistical discrepancy. Study Design and Setting: Full texts of all human RCTs published in PubMed in 1996–2017 were automatically identified and information was collected automatically. Potential indicators of QRPs included author-specific, publication-specific, and journal-specific characteristics. Beta, logistic, and linear regression models were used to identify associations between these potential indicators and QRPs. Results: We included 163,129 RCT publications. The median probability of bias assessed using Robot Reviewer software ranged between 43% and 63% for the four risk of bias domains. A more recent publication year, trial registration, mentioning of CONsolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials-checklist, and a higher journal impact factor were consistently associated with a lower risk of QRPs. Conclusion: This comprehensive analysis provides an insight into indicators of QRPs. Researchers should be aware that certain characteristics of the author team and publication are associated with a higher risk of QRPs. © 2022 The Authors"
"This paper examines the effects of online campaigns celebrating frontline workers on COVID-19 outcomes regarding new cases, deaths, and vaccinations, using the United Kingdom as a case study. We implement text and sentiment analysis on Twitter data and feed the result into random regression forests and cointegration analysis. Our combined machine learning and econometric approach shows very weak effects of both the volume and the sentiment of Twitter discussions on new cases, deaths, and vaccinations. On the other hand, established relationships (such as between stringency measures and cases/deaths and between vaccinations and deaths) are confirmed. On the contrary, we find adverse lagged effects from negative sentiment to vaccinations and from new cases to negative sentiment posts. As we assess the knowledge acquired from the COVID-19 crisis, our findings can be used by policy makers, particularly in public health, and prepare for the next pandemic. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"Background People with advanced cancer frequently use the GP out-of-hours (GPOOH) service. Considerable amounts of routine GPOOH data are uncoded. Therefore, these data are omitted from existing healthcare datasets. Aim To conduct a free-text analysis of a GPOOH dataset, to identify reasons for attendance and care delivered through GPOOH to people with advanced cancer. Design and setting An analysis of a GPOOH healthcare dataset was undertaken. It contained all coded and free-text information for 5749 attendances from a cohort of 2443 people who died from cancer in Tayside, Scotland, from 2013–2015. Method Random sampling methods selected 575 consultations for free-text analysis. Each consultation was analysed by two independent reviewers to determine the following: assigned presenting complaints; key and additional palliative care symptoms recorded in free text; evidence of anticipatory care planning; and free-text recording of dispensed medications. Inter-rater reliability concordance was established through Kappa testing. Results More than half of all coded reasons for attendance (n= 293; 51.0%) were ‘other’ or ‘missing’. Free-text analysis demonstrated that nearly half (n= 284; 49.4%) of GPOOH attendances by people with advanced cancer were for pain or palliative care. More than half of GPOOH attendances (n= 325; 56.5%) recorded at least one key or additional palliative care symptom in free text, with the commonest being breathlessness, vomiting, cough, and nausea. Anticipatory care planning was poorly recorded in both coded and uncoded records. Uncoded medications were dispensed in more than one-quarter of GPOOH consultations. Conclusion GPOOH delivers a substantial amount of pain management and palliative care, much of which is uncoded. Therefore, it is unrecognised and under-reported in existing large healthcare data analyses. © The Authors."
"Background: Although patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) have become a regularly used metric, there is little consensus on the methodology used to determine clinically relevant postoperative outcomes. We systematically reviewed the literature for studies that have identified metrics of clinical efficacy after total hip arthroplasty (THA) including minimal clinically important difference (MCID), patient acceptable symptom state (PASS), minimal detectable change (MDC), and substantial clinical benefit (SCB). Methods: A systematic review examining quantitative metrics for assessing clinical improvement with PROMs following THA was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines using the MEDLINE database from 2008 to 2020. Inclusion criteria included full texts, English language, primary THA with minimum 1-year follow-up, use of metrics for assessing clinical outcomes with PROMs, and primary derivations of those metrics. Sixteen studies (24,487 THA patients) met inclusion criteria and 11 different PROMs were reported. Results: MCIDs were calculated using distribution methods in 7 studies (44%), anchor methods in 2 studies (13%), and both methods in 2 studies (13%). MDC was calculated in 2 studies, PASS was reported in 1 study using anchor-based method, and SCB was calculated in 1 study using anchor-based method. Conclusion: There is a lack of consistency in the literature regarding the use and interpretation of PROMs to assess patient satisfaction. MCID was the most frequently reported measure, while MDC, SCB, and PASS were used relatively infrequently. Method of derivation varied based on the PROM used; distribution method was more frequently used for MCID. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Surveillance of drug overdose deaths relies on death certificates for identification of the substances that caused death. Drugs and drug classes can be identified through the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), codes present on death certificates. However, ICD-10 codes do not always provide high levels of specificity in drug identification. To achieve more fine-grained identification of substances on death certificate, the free-text cause-of-death section, completed by the medical certifier, must be analyzed. Current methods for analyzing free-text death certificates rely solely on lookup tables for identifying specific substances, which must be frequently updated and maintained. To improve identification of drugs on death certificates, a deep-learning named-entity recognition model was developed, utilizing data from the Kentucky Drug Overdose Fatality Surveillance System (2014–2019), which achieved an F1-score of 99.13%. This model can identify new drug misspellings and novel substances that are not present on current surveillance lookup tables, enhancing the surveillance of drug overdose deaths. © The Author(s) 2022.

"A large number of Web APIs have been released as services in mobile communications, but the service provided by a single Web API is usually limited. To enrich the services in mobile communications, developers have combined Web APIs and developed a new service, which is known as a mashup. The emergence of mashups greatly increases the number of services in mobile communications, especially in mobile networks and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), and has encouraged companies and individuals to develop even more mashups, which has led to the dramatic increase in the number of mashups. Such a trend brings with it big data, such as the massive text data from the mashups themselves and continually-generated usage data. Thus, the question of how to determine the most suitable mashups from big data has become a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a mashup recommendation framework from big data in mobile networks and the IoT. The proposed framework is driven by machine learning techniques, including neural embedding, clustering, and matrix factorization. We employ neural embedding to learn the distributed representation of mashups and propose to use cluster analysis to learn the relationship among the mashups. We also develop a novel Joint Matrix Factorization (JMF) model to complete the mashup recommendation task, where we design a new objective function and an optimization algorithm. We then crawl through a real-world large mashup dataset and perform experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves high accuracy in mashup recommendation and performs better than all compared baselines. © 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications"
"Background: Around 40% of the world’s population is affected by craniomandibular dysfunction (CMD). It manifests as pain, restricted movement, and/or temporomandibular joint (TMJ) noises, and is usually diagnosed and treated at a late stage due to the large variability of symptoms. It is not uncommon for the quality of life of affected persons to be impaired. Physiotherapy and splint fitting play an important role in the treatment of CMD. Objective: The aim of this study is to clarify the effects of home exercise programs and splint therapies on the main symptoms of CMD. It is assessed whether a combination of the two therapies represents an added therapeutic value. Material and methods: Studies were searched for in the PubMed, PEDro and Cochrane databases. After reviewing suitable abstracts, the full texts were summarized and critically discussed. Results: Both home exercise programs and splint therapies lead to an improvement in symptoms and quality of life. In myogenic CMD, home exercise programs show a better therapeutic effect on TMJ mobility. In contrast, no clear therapeutic successes was found for the diagnosis of dislocation with reduction. In none of the analyzed studies did a combination of the two interventions result in an added value. In the analysis of quality of life, comparability was limited due to different and nonoptimal questionnaires. Comparing the results of the interventions regarding the duration, it was found that better results were achieved at the beginning of the therapies than after a longer treatment period. Dropout rates also increased with longer follow-up times. Conclusion: Individual adaptation of home exercise programs promotes compliance and adherence to treatment. Based on the current evidence, both home exercise programs and splint therapy are an appropriate method to reduce pain and TMJ noise, and to improve TMJ mobility and quality of life. For myogenic CMD, home exercise programs are an adequate, cost-effective alternative to splint therapy. Further research is needed to analyze the exact therapeutic effect in the different diagnostic groups. Regarding quality of life, further analyses with appropriate questionnaires are needed. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"This study examined students’ ability to select relevant ideas from multiple online texts and integrate those ideas in their written products. Students (N = 162) used a web-based platform to complete an online inquiry task in which they read three texts presenting different perspectives on computer gaming and wrote an article for a school magazine on the issue based on these texts. Students selected two snippets from each text during reading and wrote their article with the selected snippets available. The selected snippets were scored according to their relevance for completing the task, and the written products were scored according to their integration quality. The results showed that most students performed well on the selection task. However, nearly half of the written products were characterized by poor integration quality. The hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that students’ selection of relevant ideas from the texts contributed to their integration of information across texts over and above both reading fluency and reading comprehension skills. The study provides new evidence on the relationship between selection and integration when younger students work with multiple texts, and both theoretical and educational implications of these findings are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Background: Guidelines for oligometastatic breast cancer (OMBC) propagate multimodality treatment including polychemotherapy and local ablative treatment (LAT) of all lesions. The aim of this approach is prolonged disease remission, or even cure. Long-term outcomes in OMBC and factors associated with prognosis are largely unknown, due to the rarity of this condition. We report overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), and prognostic factors in a large real-world cohort of patients with OMBC. Methods: Patients with breast cancer and 1–3 distant metastatic lesions, treated in the Netherlands Cancer Institute between 1997 and 2020, were identified via text mining of medical files. We collected patient, tumor and treatment characteristics. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to calculate OS and EFS estimates, and Cox regression analyses to assess prognostic factors. Results: The cohort included 239 patients, of whom 54% had ERpos/HER2neg, 20% HER2pos and 20% triple negative disease. Median follow-up was 88.0 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 82.9–93.1) during which 107 patients died and 139 developed disease progression/recurrence; median OS was 93.0 months (95%CI 66.2–119.8). Factors associated with OS in multivariable analysis were subtype, disease-free interval and radiologic response to first-line systemic therapy; LAT was associated with EFS, but not OS. Conclusions: In this large real-world cohort of patients with OMBC, OS and EFS compare favorably to survival in the general MBC population. Radiologic complete response to first-line systemic therapy was associated with favorable OS and EFS, indicating the importance of early optimal systemic therapy. The value of LAT in OMBC requires further study. © 2022 The Authors"
"Until the late 15th century, knowledge of Ptolemy’s Almagest in the Latin West was constituted by Gerard of Cremona’s translation from Arabic into Latin. The text of Gerard’s translation has been examined carefully and its dependence on two different Arabic versions is well studied. However, the tables of Gerard’s Latin Almagest have not been scrutinized, and the relation to their Arabic or Greek counterparts has not been examined. In this article, I will analyze the historical mathematical structure of tables in Gerard’s Latin Almagest translated from the Arabic in comparison to their Arabic and Greek precursors. While Gerard’s text has proved to be a faithful translation from Arabic templates, some of the tables will turn out to be different. Fundamental tables for, for example, the chord interpolation values, declination, and rising times appear to have been recomputed in order to match Ptolemy’s proofs and paradigm computations, which, in contrast, generally diverge in both Greek and Arabic tradition with the tables. It remains unclear if Gerard himself or someone in his company recalculated these tables and thus deliberately aimed to correct the ancient classic of astronomy. By a systematic analysis of these tables, I intend to provide a novel perspective on the medieval transmission and translation of knowledge, its cross-cultural exchange, and especially the practice of Gerard of Cremona and his collaborator(s). © The Author(s) 2022."
"Purpose:To evaluate patient-reported visual outcomes of immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery (ISBCS) compared with delayed sequential bilateral cataract surgery (DSBCS).Setting:Tertiary university teaching hospital of Laval University, Quebec City, Canada.Design:Prospective observational cohort study.Methods:The Catquest-9SF questionnaire was administered on the day of surgery for ISBCS patients and on the day of first-eye surgery for DSBCS patients who underwent cataract surgery between August and September 2021. The questionnaire was administered again 1 month postoperatively for ISBCS patients and 1 month postoperatively after each surgery for DSBCS patients.Results:186 patients (ISBCS: n = 152 vs DSBCS: n = 34) were included. At 1 month postoperatively, the Catquest-9SF score of ISBCS patients was significantly lower than that of DSBCS patients after first-eye surgery (P <.001). Furthermore, the ISBCS group achieved significantly better scores on multiple tasks of the Catquest-9SF, such as reading text in the newspaper (P <.001) or reading text on television (P <.001). In multiple linear regression analysis, the type of surgery was the factor most associated with a lower Catquest-9SF score (β = -0.391, P <.001). 1 month after the second-eye surgery, DSBCS patients had achieved similar Catquest-9SF scores compared with ISBCS patients.Conclusions:Compared with DSBCS patients, ISBCS patients had significantly greater perceived visual function and fewer vision-related limitations in their daily activities at 1 month postoperatively. This difference lost significance 1 month after the second-eye surgery of DSBCS patients. This patient-reported outcome study did not find evidence of perceived bilateral visual impairment in the early postoperative period after ISBCS. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.. All rights reserved."
"Objectives: This study aimed to quantify injury claims in organised community cricket in New Zealand over a 10-year period, 1 July, 2008 to June 30, 2018. Design: Retrospective analysis of administrative insurance claims data from the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC), New Zealand. Methods: Injury claims relating to cricket in males and females in New Zealand were identified from coded data and relevant text searches of routinely collected claims data. Summary statistics for key variables (age, body part, injury type, and injury factors) are presented together with annual injury claim incidence rates (ICR) calculated using population-based denominators. Results: There were 62,776 claims for cricket injury occurring at a place of recreation/sports. Most claims were in males (91.4%) and those aged 15–19 year old age group. There was an increase in the total number of injury claims over the 10-year period (1.5%, p = 0.04), but the ICR was consistent (males: varying between 258.8–304.8, and females: 22.6–28.3 claims annually per 100,000 population). Soft tissue injury claims were the most common injury type. Lumbosacral claims were most common for bowlers (78%). Lower limb injury claims were the predominant claim from batting (36%) and fielding (42%), with knee injury claims (34%) being the most common lower-limb injury location. Conclusions: Lumbosacral, shoulder and knee injuries were common amongst all playing positions and worthy of preventative attention. Strategies targeting prevention of these injuries may reduce the ICR within the ACC. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Introduction Observational studies in health-related research often aim to answer causal questions. Missing data are common in these studies and often occur in multiple variables, such as the exposure, outcome and/or variables used to control for confounding. The standard classification of missing data as missing completely at random, missing at random (MAR) or missing not at random does not allow for a clear assessment of missingness assumptions when missingness arises in more than one variable. This presents challenges for selecting an analytic approach and determining when a sensitivity analysis under plausible alternative missing data assumptions is required. This is particularly pertinent with multiple imputation (MI), which is often justified by assuming data are MAR. The objective of this scoping review is to examine the use of MI in observational studies that address causal questions, with a focus on if and how (a) missingness assumptions are expressed and assessed, (b) missingness assumptions are used to justify the choice of a complete case analysis and/or MI for handling missing data and (c) sensitivity analyses under alternative plausible assumptions about the missingness mechanism are conducted. Methods and analysis We will review observational studies that aim to answer causal questions and use MI, published between January 2019 and December 2021 in five top general epidemiology journals. Studies will be identified using a full text search for the term € multiple imputation' and then assessed for eligibility. Information extracted will include details about the study characteristics, missing data, missingness assumptions and MI implementation. Data will be summarised using descriptive statistics. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required for this review because data will be collected only from published studies. The results will be disseminated through a peer reviewed publication and conference presentations.

"In this paper, we present a research approach that sheds light on how netizens on social media perform and negotiate their multimodal and multisemiotic repertoires embedded within their social media languaging practices. This approach brings multimodal social semiotics into conversation with the normativity of translingualism to problematise the notion of languages as being ‘ordinary’ or ‘mundane’, and to illustrate how translingual netizens deploy their knowledge of the features of different language scripts, modalities and ‘small things’ (e.g., the use of emojis, replies, and comments) to increase and exploit their communicative capacity. In order to explore this claim, drawing upon digital ethnography approaches as our guiding methodology, the study investigates a YouTube post and responding comments from Global South settings. We illustrate that the subtext of their translingual practices is influenced by how they move beyond discourses and ideologies from the Global North. The analysis will consider the nature of communication in the aforementioned online communities from historical and contemporary perspectives, focusing on how our participants exploit local linguistic diversity as a resource and on how they extract a piece of text or discourse from its original context and bring it to a new context (i.e., online) and modify this material so that it fits into the new context. This article, therefore, contributes to the emerging body of work on the normativity of translingualism in communities around the world. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
"Mineral exploration reports include not only a large number of geological profiles but also geological text by offering valuable information and knowledge about the geological environments in which mineral deposits form. Extracting and understanding historical data can assist in the fast analysis of geological content and support 3D model construction. However, geological texts are written in unstructured form and have many correlations with geological profiles. It is a challenging task to derive meaningful geological information without manually reading through a large collection of reports, which is a formidable task for geologists. This paper proposes a geological profile-text association framework for constructing a knowledge graph, and it aims to understand the contents of the geological profile, transform a larger amount of textual data into structure form, and link the geological profile and text to a graph-based knowledge representation that assists further analysis of knowledge discovery. The concept of constructing vector geological profile rock layer objectification is proposed to make each rock layer with geometric features and attribute information for the geological profile, and the geological entity relationship is extracted to form a triple by deep learning and stored and expressed in the form of a graph structure for geological text. Finally, a geological profile and text association model is established by word vector similarity. The proposed approach is capable of rapidly and robustly understanding geological profiles, extracting geological texts, establishing correlations between them, and performing geological knowledge mining. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"Burnout in family doctors (FDs) affects their well-being, patient care, and healthcare organizations, and is considered common worldwide. However, its measurement has been so inconsistent that whether the widely divergent prevalence figures can be meaningfully interpreted has been questioned. Our aim was to go further than previous systematic reviews to explore the meaning contribution and usefulness of FD-burnout prevalence estimates. Worldwide literature was systematically reviewed using Levac's scoping framework, with 249 papers undergoing full-text review. Of 176 studies measuring burnout, 78% used the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), which measures burnout as now defined by the World Health Organization. We, therefore, concentrated on the MBI. Its burnout measurement was markedly inconsistent, with prevalence estimates ranging from 2.8% to 85.7%. Researchers made prevalence claims relating to burnout severity and implied diagnoses based on participants' MBI scores, even though the MBI has not been validated as a clinical or diagnostic tool. Except when comparisons were possible between certain studies, prevalence figures provided limited meaning and added little to the understanding of burnout in FDs. Our review revealed a lack of research-supported meaningful information about the prevalence of FD burnout and that care is required to avoid drawing unsubstantiated conclusions from prevalence results. This paper's overall purpose is to propose how obtaining meaningful prevalence estimates can begin, which are recognized as key to developing improved prevention policies and interventions. Researchers must adopt a consistent means to measure burnout, use the MBI as its authors intended, and explore making progress through quantitative and qualitative collaboration. © 2022 The Authors"
"Objective: This study aimed to describe fourth-year medical students’ experiences, recorded and tracked in structured reflective teaching logs (RTLs), as participants in a year-long longitudinal medical student-as-teacher elective. Methods: Thirteen (13) participants from two medical student-as-teacher elective cohorts completed 20 contact hours of self-selected teaching. Participants chose three different learning environments spanning the first 3 years of the medical school curriculum. Reflections were entered into an online spreadsheet with guided prompts (RTL). Open-ended text in the RTLs was analyzed using an inductive qualitative research approach. Open coding was applied across all meaningful segments of text, identifying themes that were validated internally with three co-authors and one methodology expert without formal program involvement. Results: Narratives revealed detailed descriptions and reflections of participant experiences. Analysis revealed eight themes: (1) Joy of Teaching; (2) Teaching Effectiveness; (3) Feedback; (4) Effective Patient-Physician Communication; (5) Assessment; (6) Differential Diagnosis Development; (7) Standardized Case Development; and (8) Training for Teaching in Residency. Conclusion: Fourth-year medical student participants in a longitudinal medical student-as-teacher elective effectively used RTLs from participatory teaching to help facilitate their own development as clinician-educators. Themes identified in RTLs reflect students’ awareness of teaching skill requirements and readiness for the next workplace, residency. Informed by situativity theory, formal teaching opportunities in authentic learning environments bestow students with critical formative teaching experience and awareness of the roles as clinician-educators during their undergraduate years. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Association of Medical Science Educators."
"Background: Severe thermal discomfort may increase risk of drowning due to hypothermia or hyperthermia from prolonged exposure to noxious water temperatures. The importance of using a behavioral thermoregulation model with thermal sensation may predict the thermal load that the human body receives when exposed to various immersive water conditions. However, there is no thermal sensation “gold standard” model specific for water immersion. This scoping review aims to present a comprehensive overview regarding human physiological and behavioral thermoregulation during whole-body water immersion and explore the feasibility for an accepted defined sensation scale for cold and hot water immersion. Methods: A standard literary search was performed on PubMed, Google Scholar, and SCOPUS. The words “Water Immersion,” “Thermoregulation,” “Cardiovascular responses” were used either as independent searched terms and MeSH terms (Medical Subject Headings) or in combination with other text words. The inclusion criteria for clinical trials terms to thermoregulatory measurements (core or skin temperature), whole-body immersion, 18–60 years old and healthy individuals. The prementioned data were analyzed narratively to achieve the overall study objective. Results: Twenty-three published articles fulfilled the review inclusion/exclusion criteria (with nine measured behavioral responses). Our outcomes illustrated a homogenous thermal sensation in a variety of water temperatures ranges, that was strongly associated with thermal balance, and observed different thermoregulatory responses. This scoping review highlights the impact of water immersion duration on human thermoneutral zone, thermal comfort zone, and thermal sensation. Conclusion: Our findings enlighten the significance of thermal sensation as a health indicator for establishing a behavioral thermal model applicable for water immersion. This scoping review provides insight for the needed development of subjective thermal model of thermal sensation in relation to human thermal physiology specific to immersive water temperature ranges within and outside the thermal neutral and comfort zone. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Aim To compare the outcome of sole dexmedetomidine or with other sedative drugs in paediatric patients during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods Literature was obtained from PubMed and ScienceDirect from 2010-2020 using key words: sedation, paediatric, dexmedetomidine, ambulatory, MRI, ketamine, propofol, midazolam. The literature selection was based on Participant, Intervention, Comparators, Outcomes (PICO) analysis. All English full-text and peer-reviewed articles were included. The primary outcome was hemodynamic stability, respiratory compromise, and recovery time. The risk of bias analysis was assessed using Cochrane collaboration Risk of Bias (RoB 2.0). Result Of 106 studies, 17 studies were included with a total 3.430 paediatric patients undergoing MRI. Dexmedetomidine alone provides a more stable hemodynamic but longer recovery time than ketamine, propofol or midazolam. The combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine provides more stable hemodynamics, especially in the incidence of hypotension and bradycardia, and does not significantly reduce airway configuration more than sole dexmedetomidine or ketamine. Intranasal dexmedetomidine is more recommended than its combination with midazolam. Combining dexmedetomidine with ketamine, propofol or midazolam provides a shorter recovery time. Conclusion A combination of dexmedetomidine with other sedatives such as ketamine, propofol and midazolam is better than sole dexmedetomidine for paediatric sedation during magnetic resonance imaging. © 2023, Medical Association of Zenica-Doboj Canton.

"Purpose: This study explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown on people with lived experience of sudden bereavement as a consequence of an epilepsy-related death. Method: We developed an online survey with fixed choice and open-ended response formats to collect data on grief symptoms and well-being during the pandemic. A total of 275 people bereaved by epilepsy-related deaths between 1980–2020 participated in this study: with 79 participants providing free-text responses for inductive thematic analysis. Results: In total, 84% of participants reported a bereavement following a sudden death of a person aged under 40, with 22% aged 19 and under. The majority (77% of participants) reported they had been thinking more about the person who died compared to before the COVID-19 outbreak and 54% had experienced more distressing flashbacks to the time of death. Additionally, 61% reported more difficulties falling asleep and staying asleep and 88% of participants reported that the outbreak and response measures had negatively impacted upon their mental health. Medication was being taken for a diagnosed mental health condition by 33% of participants at the time of the study. We categorized these negative experiences during COVID in to four main-themes - ‘Family’, ‘Lifestyle’, ‘Personal Well-being’ and ‘Health Services and Shielding Populations’. The ‘Personal Well-being’ theme was inextricably linked to grief symptoms including ‘reflection on the death’, ‘re-exposure to feeling’, ‘grief’, ‘salience of sudden deaths in the media’ and ‘inability to commemorate anniversaries and rituals’. These findings were consistent for bereaved people irrespective of the recency of the death. Conclusion: This study highlights the impact of the disruption caused by the pandemic on the grief-management of those bereaved by epilepsy-related death. Grief is not static and its management is connected to the psychosocial and formal support structures that were disrupted during the pandemic. The removal of these supports had an adverse effect upon the mental health and well-being of many bereaved. There is an urgent need for a system-wide transformation of epilepsy and mental health services to be inclusive of the needs and experiences of people impacted by sudden deaths in epilepsy and the contribution of the specialist service developed by families and clinicians to meet this gap. © 2023 Elsevier Inc."
"Background: Systematic reviews have found that doctors can have a substantial effect on patients’ physical health, beyond what can be explained by known factors. In a previous qualitative study, 13 medical doctors were interviewed on their experiences of exceptionally good doctors, and all had met at least one such doctor. Objective: To determine how common it is for exceptionally good doctors to be encountered by patients and what are the characteristics of exceptionally good doctors. Design: Mixed methods cross-sectional survey of 580 Amazon Mechanical Turk participants. Questions included doctor and participant demographics, and 34 Likert questions on characteristics of exceptionally good and average doctors. Free-text questions allowed participants to describe exceptional doctors, record their experience, and provide survey feedback. Stratified sampling ensured gender parity and 33% of participants aged ≥55 years. Analysis included descriptive statistics, statistical modelling of associations between Likert scale scores and patient demographics, and factor analysis. Results: Of 580 responses, 505 (86%) were included in the analysis. Factor analysis confirmed internal validity. Most respondents (86%) had met at least two exceptionally good doctors, of whom 55% were specialists. 58% of respondents regarded doctors as exceptional based on an overall impression with multiple reasons. Doctors were most commonly considered exceptional based on one or more of their personality, diagnostic, or intervention ability. Respondents who reported the doctors “willingly listened to them to the end” scored their doctors higher on 33 of 34 Likert questions, except for popularity. They also rated average doctors lower throughout. Conclusions: Exceptionally good doctors appear to be commonly encountered by the adult public. Listening to patients willingly to the end is a highly rated and influential characteristic, suggesting that listening could be targeted for quality improvement. © 2023 The Authors"
"Background/Aim: Intramedullary spinal cord metastases (ISCM) are deemed extremely aggressive, as confirmed by the low life expectancy since the diagnosis. Up to 26.5% of total ISCM stem from breast cancer (BC), representing the second most frequent primary site after the lung. The increasing incidence of BC and the widespread use of MRI for the diagnosis could therefore lead to an earlier diagnosis and, therefore, to a progressively longer survival in patients affected by ISCM from BC. This systematic review is intended to provide an orientation through a management algorithm for the most appropriate therapeutic approach in these patients. Materials and Methods: The research strategy initially relied on title and abstract analysis. The article’s full text was retrieved for further investigation if the title and abstract met the inclusion criteria. The extracted data included the following: authors, publication time, study design, patient characteristics, ISCM location, treatment modalities, time interval from initial cancer diagnosis to ISCM diagnosis, clinical outcomes, and survival time. Results: This systematic search regarding ISCM from BC yielded 574 articles. After screening, a total of 44 studies were included in this systematic review. A total of 123 patients were evaluated. The mean patient age was 53.2 years with a standard deviation of 10.4 years. Female patients were 122. There was only one male patient. Conclusion: ISCM from BC have a better prognosis than lung metastases and, thanks to recent advances in diagnostic imaging and intraoperative planning and neuromonitoring, an early diagnosis and a prompt multidisciplinary treatment may be accomplished. Prospective studies to generate evidence-based data regarding the most appropriate treatment for ISCM are mandatory. © 2023 Authors. All rights reserved."
"Embedded sensors in microfluidic systems play a big role in different chemical and biological analyses. Versatile metal electrodes in microfluidic chips have been designed to detect the physical and chemical parameters of the fluid, but in situ monitoring by flexible and transparent embedded sensors still remains a significant challenge. Here, such a challenge is tackled for the first time, by simple fabrication of multiapplication sensing patches into a microfluidic chip. The sensing patches are made with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and fluorescent dye. Different strategies of assembling sensing patches could be used to realize both local and dynamic sensing for multiscale detection. In Strategy 1, one sensing patch is utilized to measure the temperature of microheaters below 100 °C and its detecting resolution is 1.25 °C. In Strategy 2, four sensing patches are placed in four channels to monitor the real-time temperature change (23 °C-50 °C) in different microchannels. In Strategy 3, two sensing patches are fabricated in a microchannel, which has a high signal resolution to monitor the flow rate of less than 10 ~\mu \text{L} /min. The simple fabrication process and different combinatorial strategies facilitate the development of miniaturization and functionalization of microfluidic sensors, so as to realize the monitoring of more parameters and play a significant role in the fields of biological and chemical analysis.  © 2001-2012 IEEE."
"Social media popularity prediction is an important channel to explore content sharing and communication on social networks. It aims to capture informative cues by analyzing multi-type data (such as images, user profiles, and text) to decide the popularity of a specified post. Intuitively, given an image, humans can volitionally focus on salient objects and relationships that are associated with their interests. For example, when we see the image including the relationship “elephant-attack-van”, it is more natural to increase our interest than the image with “elephant-near-van”. Therefore, exploiting such structural relationships is expected to help the prediction model search for evidence in support of the popularity of posts. However, most current works only focus on the global representation or the isolated objects, while ignoring the structure knowledge contained in images. To address this problem, we propose the relationship-aware social media popularity predictor. First, we extract inter-object relationships via a pre-trained scene graph generator. Then, we design a content-based filtering module to filter redundant relationships and capture the key 〈subject–predicate–object〉 information. Finally, we integrate relationship information with multi-type heterogeneous data and feed them into the CatBoost model for regression. Moreover, our predictor is capable of generating more intuitive interpretations by analyzing visual relationships in images to reasonably infer popularity scores. Extensive experiments conducted on the Social Media Prediction Dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform other state-of-the-art models. Additional ablation studies and visualizations further validate the effectiveness and interpretability. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."

"Web servers store every event in the form of logs, which contain the retrieved URL, client IP address, access time, HTTP status code, etc. There are several useful methods to analyze these log files, which are mainly based on sequential text mining techniques for applications like prefetching or driving critical information about system's security. Finding ways to convert web server log files into graph structures may open new horizons in complex network analysis for investigation, comparison, and prediction. Since visibility graph has various successful usages for analyzing different time series data, web server log files as a kind of time-series data have the potential to be converted into visibility graph. In this research, we propose a novel method to convert web server log files into horizontal visibility graphs. Afterward, we demonstrate the result of the method on two popular datasets, NASA and Online Judge web server log files, and perform exploratory and visibility graph analysis techniques like centrality measures computation and community detection to show the promising future for the research. Moreover, we introduce a novel algorithm for a common application in web server log file analysis, web prefetching, based on a modified version of link prediction on the extracted visibility graph, and evaluate it based on AUC assessment and propose the next page to prefetch in each dataset. Finally, we propose several choices to extend the research in case of technical and practical aspects. © 2023 Elsevier B.V."
"Flexible strain sensors have significant progress in the fields of human-computer interaction, medical monitoring, and handwriting recognition, but they also face many challenges such as the capture of weak signals, comprehensive acquisition of the information, and accurate recognition. Flexible strain sensors can sense externally applied deformations, accurately measure human motion and physiological signals, and record signal characteristics of handwritten text. Herein, we prepare a sandwich-structured flexible strain sensor based on an MXene/polypyrrole/hydroxyethyl cellulose (MXene/PPy/HEC) conductive material and a PDMS flexible substrate. The sensor features a wide linear strain detection range (0-94%), high sensitivity (gauge factor 357.5), reliable repeatability (>1300 cycles), ultrafast response-recovery time (300 ms), and other excellent sensing properties. The MXene/PPy/HEC sensor can detect human physiological activities, exhibiting excellent performance in measuring external strain changes and real-time motion detection. In addition, the signals of English words, Arabic numerals, and Chinese characters handwritten by volunteers measured by the MXene/PPy/HEC sensor have unique characteristics. Through machine learning technology, different handwritten characters are successfully identified, and the recognition accuracy is higher than 96%. The results show that the MXene/PPy/HEC sensor has a significant impact in the fields of human motion detection, medical and health monitoring, and handwriting recognition. © 2023 American Chemical Society."

"Objective: To understand the effectiveness of Rescue Improvement Conference, a forum that addresses FTR. Summary of Background Data: Every year over 150,000 patients die after elective surgery in the United States. FTR is the phenomenon whereby delayed recognition and/or response to serious surgical complications leads to a progressive cascade of adverse events culminating in death. Rescue Improvement Conference is an adapted version of the Ottawa-style morbidity and mortality conference, designed to address common contributors to FTR: ineffective communication and inadequate problem solving. Methods: Mixed methods data were used to evaluate Rescue Improvement Conference, a bi-monthly forum that was first introduced in our academic medical center in 2018. Conference effectiveness data were collected via survey and open-text responses after 5 conferences between September 2018 and February 2020. We focused on 5 indicators of effectiveness: educational value, conference takeaways, discussion time, changes to surgical practice, and actionable opportunities for improvement. Twelve surgical faculty and house staff also provided feedback during semi-structured interviews. Qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Conference attendees (N = 140) felt that Rescue Improvement Conference was effectiveâ € ""all 5 indicators had mean scores above 5 on Likert scales. The qualitative data supports the quantitative findings, and 3 additional themes emerged: Rescue Improvement Conference enables the representation of diverse voices, promotes interdisciplinary collaboration, and encourages multilevel problem solving. Conclusions: Rescue Improvement Conference has the potential to support other surgical departments in developing system-level strategies to recognize and manage postoperative complications by providing stakeholders a forum to identify and discuss factors that contribute to FTR.  © 2022 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Shift workers commonly report insomnia symptoms. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi) is the first line treatment for insomnia, however efficacy in shift workers is not well understood. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates existing trials of CBTi in shift working populations. A systematic literature search was conducted across seven electronic databases (n = 2120). Fifty-two full-text articles were reviewed and of these, nine studies (across ten publications with a total of 363 participants) were deemed suitable for inclusion. Heterogeneity was considerable between studies, with variability in study design, style and delivery of intervention, and follow-up times. Small sample sizes were common and attrition was high. Some studies modified aspects of CBTi for use in shift workers, while others were limited to psycho-education as part of larger intervention studies. Mean differences (MD) pre and post CBTi were modest for both the insomnia severity index (ISI; MD: -3.08, 95% CI: -4.39, −1.76) and the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI; MD: -2.38, 95% CI: -3.55, −1.21). Neither difference was of a magnitude considered to reflect a clinically significant improvement. Tailored approaches to CBTi are needed for shift workers to improve efficacy, ideally including co-production with workers to ensure interventions meet this population's needs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Purpose: The study aims at (i) summarizing construction waste management studies from 2013 to 2022; (ii) understanding the current state of the body of knowledge, as well as keyword co-occurrence, document co-citation, cluster analysis, and visual maps; and (iii) identifying the research gap in the construction waste management studies, including gaps in major knowledge domains, and (iv) providing future directions for research areas in the construction waste management. Methodology: We apply the scientometric analysis approach, which maps the visualization review of a particular knowledge domain. Using the proximity analysis method, a relational analysis of concepts in published studies were conducted. This analytical method is employed to ascertain the association between a selected point and its neighbors. We developed a “concept matrix” and a group of linked co-occurring terms that suggested a larger meaning using this method. Findings: A total of 974 authors from 61 different countries contributed to the 375 full text research publications on the construction waste management that were indexed in Scopus between 2013 and 2022. The top three authors in terms of output were; Lu W (15 publications), Tam V.W.Y (14 publication), and Zuo, J (10 publications). The author with the most citations is Lu W., who has 648, followed by Yuan (7 3 1), and Tam V.W.Y. (6 1 0). It was discovered that China, Australia and Hong Kong had a significant influence on how construction waste management was used. The analysis revealed that the most active research fields at the moment are demolition, sustainable development, waste disposal, environmental impact of construction waste, waste recycling, reduction, and reuse. Originality: The study presents the results of a recent, updated scientometric analysis from 2013 to 2022, which identified the construction waste management field's most active authors, countries, journals, publication trends, affiliation, funding sponsors, and research areas. This study will provide a pathway for the upcoming researchers to follow the construction and demolition waste (C&DW) trends to add in the body of knowledge and contribute to the (C&DW), knowledge domains. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Background: The quality of allergy documentation in electronic health records is frequently poor. Objective: To compare the usability of 3 graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for drug allergy documentation. Methods: Physicians tested 3 GUIs by means of 5 fictional drug allergy scenarios: the current GUI (GUI 0), using mainly free-text, and 2 new coded versions (GUI 1 and GUI 2) asking information on allergen category, specific allergen, symptom(s), symptom onset, timing of initial reaction, and diagnosis status with a semiautomatic delabeling feature. Satisfaction was measured by the System Usability Scale questionnaire, efficiency by time to complete the tasks, and effectiveness by a task completion score. Posttest interviews provided more in-depth qualitative feedback. Results: Thirty physicians from 7 different medical specialties and with varying degrees of experience participated. The mean System Usability Scale scores for GUI 1 (77.25, adjective rating “Good”) and GUI 2 (78.42, adjective rating “Good”) were significantly higher than for GUI 0 (56.58, adjective rating “OK”) (Z, 6.27, Padj <.001 and Z, 6.62, Padj <.001, respectively). There was no significant difference in task time between GUIs. Task completion scores of GUI 1 and GUI 2 were higher than for GUI 0 (Z, 9.59, Padj <.001 and Z, 11.87, Padj <.001, respectively). Quantitative and qualitative findings were combined to propose a GUI 3 with high usability. Conclusions: The usability and quality of allergy documentation was higher for the newly developed coded GUIs with a semiautomatic delabeling feature without being more time-consuming. © 2022 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology"
"Aiming at the complex and changeable environment and the low public participation in emergency decision-making, this article proposes a method for the dynamic collaboration of the public and experts in large-scale group emergency decision-making (LSGEDM) based on social media data. First, sentiment analysis is carried out on text data from social media platforms to evaluate the quality of LSGEDM at both the attribute and comprehensive levels. Then, according to the decision-making quality at the attribute level, a method for the dynamic updating of attribute weights is proposed. Next, in the social network environment, the trust relationship between experts is dynamically updated based on the comprehensive quality of decision-making and the distance between the expert and group preferences, and expert weights are calculated by the improved PageRank algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are verified via its application to the COVID-19 epidemic in China and a comparative analysis. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Aim: Mobile health (mHealth) is playing an increasingly important role in the computerization of wound care on an international scale with an aim to improve care. The aim of this scoping review protocol is to present a transparent process for how we plan to search and review the existing evidence related to self-supporting mobile wound care applications used by nurses. Materials and methods: The scoping review will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology. An exploratory search was performed using MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase, CINAHL (Ebsco), to identify concepts, keywords, MeSH terms, and headings to identify study types looking for mobile applications in wound care. The findings of this search will determine the final search strategy. Data sources will include MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, LiSSa, Cochrane Wounds (Cochrane Library) and Erudit. The titles and abstracts of the identified articles will be screened independently by two authors for relevance. Full texts will also be screened by two independent reviewers and data extraction will be performed in accordance with a pre-designed extraction form. All types of studies and literature linked to self-supporting mobile wound care application used by nurses will be included (quantitative, qualitative, mixed methods and grey literature). Conclusion: The results of the scoping review will give an overview of the existing self-supporting mobile applications in wound care used by nurses. These will also help to identify the existing applications, and describe knowledge in nursing about their utilisation, development, and evaluation, as well as synthesize the available literature on their impacts. © 2023 The Authors"
"OBJECTIVE: Significant variations exist in the use of respiratory muscle ultrasound in intensive care with no society-level consensus on the optimal methodology. This systematic review aims to evaluate, synthesize, and compare the clinimetric properties of different image acquisition and analysis methodologies. DATA SOURCES: Systematic search of five databases up to November 24, 2021. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they enrolled at least 50 adult ICU patients, reported respiratory muscle (diaphragm or intercostal) ultrasound measuring either echotexture, muscle thickness, thickening fraction, or excursion, and evaluated at least one clinimetric property. Two independent reviewers assessed titles, abstracts, and full text against eligibility. DATA EXTRACTION: Study demographics, ultrasound methodologies, and clinimetric data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sixty studies, including 5,025 patients, were included with 39 studies contributing to meta-analyses. Most commonly measured was diaphragm thickness (DT) or diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF) using a linear transducer in B-mode, or diaphragm excursion (DE) using a curvilinear transducer in M-mode. There are significant variations in imaging methodology and acquisition across all studies. Inter- and intrarater measurement reliabilities were generally excellent, with the highest reliability reported for DT (ICC, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.94-0.99). Pooled data demonstrated acceptable to excellent accuracy for DT, DTF, and DE to predicting weaning outcome after 48 to 72 hours postextubation (DTF AUC, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.73-0.85). DT imaging was responsive to change over time. Only three eligible studies were available for intercostal muscles. Intercostal thickening fraction was shown to have excellent accuracy of predicting weaning outcome after 48-hour postextubation (AUC, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.78-0.91). CONCLUSIONS: Diaphragm muscle ultrasound is reliable, valid, and responsive in ICU patients, but significant variation exists in the imaging acquisition and analysis methodologies. Future work should focus on developing standardized protocols for ultrasound imaging and consider further research into the role of intercostal muscle imaging. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Objective: Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) have been increasingly emphasized for peripheral artery disease (PAD). Patient-defined treatment goals and expectations, however, are poorly understood and might not be achievable or aligned with guidelines or clinical outcomes. We evaluated the patient-reported treatment goals among patients with claudication and the associations between patient characteristics, goals, and PAD-specific PRO scores. Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of claudication were prospectively recruited. Patient-defined treatment goals and outcomes related to walking distance, duration, and speed were quantified using multiple-choice survey items. Free-text items were used to identify activities other than walking distance, duration, or speed associated with symptoms and treatment goals. The peripheral artery disease quality of life and walking impairment questionnaire instruments were included as PRO. The treatment goal categories were compared with the PRO percentile scores using 95% confidence intervals (CIs), categorical tests, and logistic regression models. Associations between the patient characteristics and PRO were evaluated using linear and ordinal logistic regression models. Results: A total of 150 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the present study. Of these 150 patients, 144 (96%) viewed the entire survey. Their mean age was 70.0 ± 11.3 years, and 32.9% were women. Most of the respondents had self-reported their race as White (n = 135), followed by Black (n = 3), Asian (n = 2), Native American (n = 2), and other/unknown (n = 2). Two participants self-reported Hispanic ethnicity. The primary treatment goals were an increased walking distance or duration without stopping (62.0%), the ability to perform a specific activity or task (23.0%), an increased walking speed (8.0%), or other/none of the above (7.0%). The specific activities associated with symptoms or goals included outdoor recreation (38.5%), labor-related tasks (30.7%), sports (26.9%), climbing stairs (23.1%), uphill walking (19.2%), and shopping (6%). Among the patients choosing an increased walking distance and duration as the primary goals, 64% had indicated that a distance of ≥0.5 mile (2640 ft) and 59% had indicated a duration of ≥30 minutes would be a minimum increase consistent with meaningful improvement. Increasing age was associated with lower odds of a distance improvement goal of ≥0.5 mile (odds ratio [OR], 0.68 per 5 years; 95% CI, 0.51-0.92; P = .012) or duration improvement goal of ≥30 minutes (OR, 0.76 per 5 years; 95% CI, 0.58-0.99; P = .047). Patient characteristics associated with PAD Quality of Life percentile scores included age, ankle brachial index, and gender. Ankle brachial index was the only patient characteristic associated with the walking impairment questionnaire percentile scores. Conclusions: Patients define treatment goals according to their desired activities and expectations, which may influence their goals and perceived outcomes. Patients’ expectations of minimum increases in walking distance and duration consistent with meaningful improvement exceeded reported minimum important difference criteria for many patients and would not be captured using common clinic-based walking tests. Patient age was associated with both treatment goals and PRO scores, and the related floor and ceiling effects could influence sensitivity to PRO changes for younger and older patients, respectively. Heterogeneity in treatment goals supports consideration of tailored decision-making and outcomes informed by patient characteristics and perspectives. © 2022 Society for Vascular Surgery"
"Given the ubiquity of electronic devices and the urgent need to decrease our footprint in the context of global warming and planetary boundaries, it becomes critical to better quantify the environmental impacts of integrated circuit (IC) production. Our work addresses this question in three successive steps. First, we carry out a review of the data available since 2010 from four different literature categories, i.e., foundry reports, industry roadmaps, scientific literature, and life-cycle assessment databases. Then, we leverage the 27 identified sources to perform both a qualitative and quantitative analysis. We propose 10 features for characterizing the scope of studies while focusing on environmental indicators normalized per cm2, i.e., energy consumption, carbon footprint and water consumption. The analysis results highlight a clear increasing trend of the environmental footprint with CMOS technology downscaling below 0.13~\mu \text{m} , despite a significant variation between the sources mainly due to scope mismatch. Finally, we show that environmental impacts per cm2 did not significantly decrease compared to historical values from 1980-2010, whereas the total silicon area produced keeps on increasing by 3.6%/year. Consequently, this work calls for urgently rethinking the road ahead with sobriety to effectively decrease the absolute environmental footprint of the IC production sub-sector.  © 1988-2012 IEEE."
"OBJECTIVES: In 2015, the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC) provided the first pediatric-specific definitions for acute respiratory distress syndrome (pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome [PARDS]). These definitions have since been operationalized in cohort and interventional PARDS studies. As substantial data have accrued since 2015, we have an opportunity to assess the construct validity and utility of the initial PALICC definitions. Therefore, the Second PALICC (PALICC-2) brought together multiple PARDS experts and aimed to identify and summarize relevant evidence related to the definition and epidemiology of PARDS and create modifications to the definition of PARDS. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), and CINAHL Complete (EBSCOhost). STUDY SELECTION: We included studies of subjects with PARDS, or at risk for PARDS, excluding studies pertaining primarily to adults except as specified for identifying age-specific cutoffs. DATA EXTRACTION: Title/abstract review, full-text review, and data extraction using a standardized data collection form. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to identify and summarize evidence and develop recommendations. A total of 97 studies were identified for full-text extraction addressing distinct aspects of the PARDS definition, including age, timing, imaging, oxygenation, modes of respiratory support, and specific coexisting conditions. Data were assessed in a Patient/Intervention/Comparator/Outcome format when possible, and formally summarized for effect size, risk, benefit, feasibility of implementation, and equity. A total of 17 consensus-based definition statements were made that update the definition of PARDS, as well as the related diagnoses of “Possible PARDS” and “At-Risk for PARDS.” These statements are presented alongside a summary of the relevant epidemiology. CONCLUSIONS: We present updated, data-informed consensus statements on the definition for PARDS and the related diagnoses of “Possible PARDS” and “At-Risk for PARDS.

"OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the use of behavioral economics approaches to promote the carrying of epinephrine auto-injectors (EAIs) among adolescents with food allergies. We hypothesized that adolescents who receive frequent text message nudges (Intervention 1) or frequent text message nudges plus modest financial incentives (Intervention 2) would be more likely to carry their epinephrine than members of the usual care control group. METHODS: We recruited 131 adolescents ages 15 to 19 with a food allergy and a current prescription for epinephrine to participate in a cohort multiple randomized controlled trial. Participants were randomly assigned to participate in Intervention 1, Intervention 2, or to receive usual care. The primary outcome was consistency of epinephrine-carrying, measured as the proportion of checkpoints at which a participant could successfully demonstrate they were carrying their EAI, with photo-documentation of the device. RESULTS: During Intervention 1, participants who received the intervention carried their EAI 28% of the time versus 38% for control group participants (P 5 .06). During Intervention 2, participations who received the intervention carried their EAI 45% of the time versus 23% for control group participants (P 5 .002). CONCLUSIONS: Text message nudges alone were unsuccessful at promoting EAI-carrying but text message nudges combined with modest financial incentives almost doubled EAI-carriage rates among those who received the intervention compared with the control group. However, even with the intervention, adolescents with food allergies carried their EAI <50% of the time. Alternative strategies for making EAIs accessible to adolescents at all times should be implemented. Copyright © 2023 by the American Academy of Pediatrics."
"This article traces the presence and absence of Frantz Fanon in the field of social and political psychology. Our work is guided by an assemblage of methods— a critical analysis of mainstream scholarship, a collective interrogation with a transnational gathering of colleagues and friends, and a deep reading of Fanon's texts on struggle, internalized oppression, violence and a new humanism. Through this, our paper is a call for radical disciplinary reflection on why Fanon has been ruthlessly exiled from social/political psychology, the potential his writings hold for courses, scholarship, and struggle, and how we might more boldly theorize, as he did, from within the fire of struggles for justice and liberation. © 2023 The Authors.

"Automated driving desires better performance on tasks like motion planning and interacting with pedestrians in mixed-traffic environments. Deep learning algorithms can achieve high performance in these tasks with remarkable visual scene understanding and generalization abilities. However, when common scene-parsing methods are used to train end-to-end models, limitations of explainability in such algorithms inhibit their implementations in fully automated driving. The main challenges include algorithm performance deficiencies and inconsistencies, insufficient AI transparency, degraded user trust, and undermining human-AI interactions. This research aids the decision-making performance and transparency of automated driving systems by providing multi-modal explanations, especially when interacting with pedestrians. The proposed algorithm combines global visual features and interrelation features by parsing scene images as self-constructed graphs and using an attention-based module to capture the interrelationship among the ego-vehicle and other traffic-related objects. The output modules make decisions while simultaneously generating semantic text explanations. The results show that the fusion of the features from global frames and interrelational graphs improves decision-making and explanation predictions compared to two state-of-the-art benchmark algorithms. The interrelation module also enhances algorithm transparency by disclosing the visual attention used for decision-making. The importance of interrelation features on the two prediction tasks is further revealed along with the underlying mechanism of multitask learning on the datasets with hierarchical labels. The proposed model improves driving decision-making during pedestrian interactions with intelligible reasoning cues for building an appropriate mental model of automated driving performance for human users. © 2016 IEEE."
"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, educational institutions at all levels closed their doors and began to operate remotely. In this paper, we analyze the educational experiences of preservice mathematics teachers (PMTs) enrolled in mathematics teacher education programs from three South American universities, as the pandemic was unfolding. An exploratory study was conducted, based on an inductive and thematic qualitative text analysis of narratives written by 24 PMTs. Based on the study, we report on the following aspects: (1) experiences of PMTs in the passage to remote education (RE) mode (considering characteristics of remote classes—interactions, the rhythm of the class, teaching work—time management, home–classroom fusion, and physical and psychological discomfort), and (2) opportunities and limitation experienced by PMTs in relation to the use of technologies. The results of the study suggest the need to rethink teacher education programs regarding the integration of technologies in mathematics classes, the opportunities offered by hybrid education, and teacher education for distance teaching. © 2022, FIZ Karlsruhe."
"Rationale: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) during hospitalization for acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD) occurs during a period of disease instability for the patient, and the safety and efficacy of PR, specifically during the hospitalization period, have not been established. Objective: The purpose of this review is to determine the safety and efficacy of PR during the hospitalization phase for individuals with AECOPD. Methods: Scientific databases were searched up to August 2022 for randomized controlled trials that compared in-hospital PR with usual care. PR programs commenced during the hospitalization and included a minimum of two sessions. Titles and abstracts followed by full-text screening and data extraction were conducted independently by two reviewers. The intervention effect estimates were calculated through meta-analysis using a random-effect model. Results: A total of 27 studies were included (n = 1,317). The meta-analysis showed that inpatient PR improved the 6-minute-walk distance by 105 m (P < 0.001). Inpatient PR improved the performance on the five-repetition sit-to-stand test by -7.02 seconds (P = 0.03). Quality of life (QOL), as measured by the 5-level EuroQoL Group-5 dimension version (EQ-ED-5L) and the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, was significantly improved by the intervention. Inpatient PR increased lower limb muscle strength by 33.35 N (P < 0.001). There was no change in the length of stay. Only one serious adverse event related to the intervention was reported. Conclusions: This review suggests that it is safe and effective to provide PR during hospitalization for individuals with AECOPD. In-hospital PR improves functional exercise capacity, QOL, and lower limb strength without prolonging the hospital length of stay."
"After completion, oil wells often require intervention services to increase productivity, correct oil flow losses, and solve mechanical failures. These interventions, known as workovers, are made using oil rigs, an expensive and scarce resource. The workover rig scheduling problem (WRSP) comprises deciding which wells demanding workovers will be attended to, which rigs will serve them, and when the operations must be performed, minimizing the rig fleet costs and the oil production loss associated with the workover delay. This study presents a data-driven optimization methodology for the WRSP using text mining and regression models to predict the duration of the workover activities and a mixed-integer linear programming model to obtain the solutions for the model. A sensitivity analysis is performed using simulation to measure the impact of the regression error in the solution. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"Currently, the quality of guidelines for the perioperative management of patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is unknown, leaving anesthesiologists to make perioperative management decisions with some degree of uncertainty. This study evaluated the quality of clinical practice guidelines regarding the perioperative management of patients with OSA. This study was reported in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A systematic search of the MedlineALL (Ovid) database was conducted from inception to February 26, 2021, for clinical practice guidelines in the English language. Quality appraisal of guidelines was evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) framework. Descriptive statistical analysis of each of the 6 domains was expressed as a percentage using the formula: (obtained score - minimum possible score)/(maximum possible score - minimum possible score). Of 192 articles identified in the search, 41 full texts were assessed for eligibility, and 10 articles were included in this review. Intraclass correlation coefficients of the AGREE II scores across the 7 evaluators for each guideline were each >0.9, suggesting that the consistency of the scores among evaluators was high. Sixty percent of recommendations were based on evidence using validated methods to grade medical literature, while the remainder were consensus based. The median and range scores of each domain were: (1) scope and purpose, 88% (60%-95%); (2) stakeholder involvement, 52% (30%-82%); (3) rigor of development, 67% (40%-90%); (4) clarity of presentation, 74% (57%-88%); (5) applicability, 46% (20%-73%); and (6) editorial independence, 67% (19%-83%). Only 4 guidelines achieved an overall score of >70%. This critical appraisal showed that many clinical practice guidelines for perioperative management of patients with OSA used validated methods to grade medical literature, such as Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) and Oxford classification, with lower scores for stakeholder involvement due to lack of engagement of patient partners and applicability domain due to lack of focus on the complete perioperative period such as postdischarge counseling. Future efforts should be directed toward establishing higher focus on the quality of evidence, stakeholder involvement, and applicability to the wider perioperative patient experience. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"The diagnosis of atmospheric pressure low-temperature plasma parameters is one of the research hot spots in plasma science. As important parameters, rotational temperature and vibrational temperature need to be measured in many application fields, such as plasma medicine, spraying, and combustion technology. Nowadays, as nonimmersion measurement technology, the plasma temperature diagnostic method based on optical emission spectroscopy (OES) shows greater advantages because it causes no pollution and interference to the plasma. However, the current measurement of molecular rotational and vibrational temperatures by OES is based on manual comparison and fitting, which has the disadvantages of cumbersome operation, heavy workload, and low efficiency. Therefore, an efficient method based on linear regression to process emission spectrum data has been proposed in relevant literature, but there is still room for improvement in accuracy and applicable range of temperature prediction. In this article, a theoretical spectral dataset with uniform and extensive temperature distribution is established, and some improvements and optimizations are made to the training variables and elastic-net regression model to obtain better fitting results. The fitting R^{2} of the experimental test dataset reaches 0.99427 and 0.96435 for these two temperatures, and the prediction time of a single spectrum data is less than 5~\mu \text{s} , almost real time, which contributes new insights into the intelligent and efficient processing of plasma emission spectrum data.  © 1973-2012 IEEE."
"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of telephone-based delivery of weekday-only time-restricted eating (TRE), its preliminary efficacy for metabolic outcomes, and concurrent lifestyle changes. Methods: Twenty-two breast cancer survivors aged 60+ years with overweight/obesity completed an 8-week feasibility study of 12 to 8 p.m. weekday-only ad libitum TRE. The intervention was delivered by one registered dietitian call, twice-daily automated text messages asking about eating start and stop times, and three support phone calls. Magnetic resonance imaging, venipuncture, and 3 days of diet records and accelerometry were performed at baseline and after intervention. Results: Participants had a mean age of 66 (SD 5) years with BMI of 31.8 (4.8) kg/m2. Intervention implementation was successful, including excellent adherence (98%), participant acceptability, and a low symptom profile and cost ($63/participant). There were no significant changes in individual components of metabolic syndrome, lipid profile, or hemoglobin A1c, despite clinically relevant changes occurring within individual participants. Magnetic resonance imaging–derived hepatic steatosis and thigh myosteatosis did not change. Dietary intake changes included reduced energy (−22%) and protein (−0.2 g/kg). Physical activity and sleep did not change. Conclusions: Eight weeks of telephone-delivered weekday TRE is a feasible, acceptable, low-symptom, and low-cost intervention. Future studies may consider a longer intervention length for more consistent metabolic improvements and counseling to enhance protein intake. © 2023 The Obesity Society."
"Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) has been suggested to affect oxygen availability and performance, and delay the onset of fatigue. Many mechanisms of HBO-induced alterations have been proposed, including modulation of various metabolic pathways, and the antioxidant defense mechanisms. As exercise per se affects similar aspects, it is tempting to speculate that simultaneous application of both, exercise and HBO might have synergistic effects. The aim of this review was to search through the currently available literature and evaluate the effect of acute exposure to HBO on exercise performance, potential effects of a combination of HBO and physical training, and to elucidate some possible mechanisms behind. We conducted searches in the PubMed and Scopus databases (search term: ""hyperbaric"" AND ""oxygen"" AND ""exercise"") and in relevant hyperbaric textbook and assessed potentially eligible full texts for details. Meta-analysis could not be performed because of a few available and rather heterogeneous studies. Twenty-seven studies were included in the final assessment (14 on exercise during HBO, 9 on exercise following HBO, 4 on applying HBO during recovery and rest between exercise bouts, and 3 on a combination of HBO and training). The results are contradictory, showing either positive or none ergogenic effects. There is some risk of bias and placebo effect. Discrepant findings of the available studies might partly be explained by different protocols applied, both regarding HBO and exercise intensity and regimen. There is a need for further research with well-designed trials to evaluate the effect of HBO on performance before recommending it to routine use in athletes. © 2023 NSCA National Strength and Conditioning Association.

"Objective: We aimed to gain insight into how and to what extent social (i.e. private/group chat) and goal-setting (e.g. rewards) functionalities in digital interventions for health behavior change were used by clients and nurses in a preventive care program for disadvantaged women during or after pregnancy, and which factors influenced usage. Methods: We collected quantitative and qualitative data on usage of these functionalities in ‘Kindle’, a mHealth intervention to prepare for health behavior change. Results: We found that nurses (n = 5) and clients (n = 20) scarcely used both functionalities. They sent 862 messages in the social functionality whose security they appreciated, but habitually used WhatsApp likewise. Moreover, nurses were hesitant to let their clients interact in the group chat. Clients formulated 59 personal goals, which they found difficult to do. Nurses rewarded 846 points for clients’ progress on goal attainment, but found it hard to determine how many points to reward. Clients and nurses indicated that the functionality made it more fun and easy to discuss clients’ personal goals. Conclusions: To conclude, digital, social and goal-setting functionalities were used to a limited extent by nurses and clients, and need optimization before implementation to support disadvantaged groups to change their health behavior. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"Rationale: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)-induced endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction contributes to OSA-related cardiovascular sequelae. The mechanistic basis of endothelial impairment by OSA is unclear. Objectives: The goals of this study were to identify the mechanism of OSA-induced EC dysfunction and explore the potential therapies for OSA-accelerated cardiovascular disease. Methods: The experimental methods include data mining, bioinformatics, EC functional analyses, OSA mouse models, and assessment of OSA human subjects. Measurements and Main Results: Using mined microRNA sequencing data, we found that microRNA 210 (miR-210) conferred the greatest induction by intermittent hypoxia in ECs. Consistently, the serum concentration of miR-210 was higher in individuals with OSA from two independent cohorts. Importantly, miR-210 concentration was positively correlated with the apnea-hypopnea index. RNA sequencing data collected from ECs transfected with miR-210 or treated with OSA serum showed a set of genes commonly altered by miR-210 and OSA serum, which are largely involved in mitochondrion-related pathways. ECs transfected with miR-210 or treated with OSA serum showed reduced [Formula: see text]o2 rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and DNA abundance. Mechanistically, intermittent hypoxia-induced SREBP2 (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2) bound to the promoter region of miR-210, which in turn inhibited the iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme and led to mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, the SREBP2 inhibitor betulin alleviated intermittent hypoxia-increased systolic blood pressure in the OSA mouse model. Conclusions: These results identify an axis involving SREBP2, miR-210, and mitochondrial dysfunction, representing a new mechanistic link between OSA and EC dysfunction that may have important implications for treating and preventing OSA-related cardiovascular sequelae."

"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted personal protective equipment (PPE) supply, distribution, and disposal issues worldwide. Calls to conserve PPE stocks and increase supply resulted in the rapid development of potential disinfection methods, with the possibility of improvements in medical waste reduction. However, how receptive health-care workers are to PPE reuse remains unknown. We aimed to examine the views of health-care workers who used PPE during the first COVID-19 wave in Aotearoa New Zealand, in relation to acceptability of PPE disinfection and reuse. Methods: In this multi-methods survey, health-care workers in New Zealand, were invited via a multimodal recruitment strategy to complete a survey regarding use of PPE during the first COVID-19 wave. Gender question options were male, female, gender diverse, or prefer not to say. Demographic differences in self-reported PPE reuse and acceptability were examined. The survey included closed (single-response, multi-response, ranking, and Likert-scale questions) and open-text questions. Any open-text comments were analysed with thematic analysis. The survey was built and deployed using Qualtrics software. Findings: 1411 health-care workers completed the survey between Oct 7 and Nov 30, 2020. 1397 participants had gender data available (1140 [82%] female and 257 [18%] male) and 995 (74%) of 1347 were of New Zealand European ethnicity. PPE reuse was common and reported by 628 (45%) of the 1411 participants, with 396 (63%) of the 628 reporting reusing PPE multiple times in 1 day. Acceptability of the concept of PPE disinfection for potential reuse was high overall (1196 [85%] of 1411) but varied depending on the type of PPE. Thematic analysis confirmed that PPE reuse was already occurring and respondents recognised the potential benefits of reduced medical wastage and increased PPE supply. Important caveats for consideration included the availability of scientific evidence, level of negotiated risk, and trust in the organisation undertaking PPE disinfection, with clear communication about decontamination processes being crucial to acceptability. Interpretation: PPE reuse occurred frequently during the first wave of COVID-19 in New Zealand. Although support for the disinfection of PPE for reuse was high, the success of any future programmes to reuse PPE will require meaningful engagement and clear communication with health-care workers. Further research into PPE disinfection safety and logistics is warranted, alongside the development of standard operating procedures and clearly communicated policies for the end user, should this more sustainable health-care practice be planned for adoption in certain settings.

"Context: Meal skipping may contribute to nutrient deficiency across the lifespan. Multiple socioecological factors have been identified as correlates of meal skipping in adolescents and adults, but evidence in older adults is limited. Objective: To determine the socioecological correlates of meal skipping in community-dwelling older adults. Data source: Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and MEDLINE electronic databases were systematically searched from inception to March 2021. Data extraction: A total of 473 original research studies on socioecological factors and meal skipping among community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years were identified. Title, abstract, and full-text review was performed by 2 reviewers independently, and a third reviewer resolved disagreements. A total of 23 studies met our inclusion criteria. Data were extracted by 1 reviewer from these studies and independently verified by another. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess methodological quality. Data analysis: The frequency of meal skipping in included studies ranged between 2.1% and 61%. This review identified 5 domains of socioecological correlates associated with meal skipping in older adults: sociodemographic, behavioral, biomedical, psychological, and social. Conclusion: Understanding the factors associated with meal skipping in older adults can inform the development of targeted interventions to improve nutrition and health.

"A systematic review of Randomised Controlled Trials in adult mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) was conducted to inform neuropsychology service development at a large tertiary Lysosomal Storage Diseases centre. Studies including psychological endpoints for cognition, mood, and quality of life were reviewed. Forty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria for full text review. Of the 48 studies, 44% (21/48) included adult participants, while psychological endpoints were used in 52% (25/48) for cognition, 11% (5/48) for mood, and 69% (33/48) for quality of life. Five studies included both adult participants and relevant psychological endpoints. Risk of bias ratings were ‘high’ for two studies, while two studies received a rating of ‘some concerns’, and the last study a ‘low’ risk of bias rating. The evidence base for psychological outcomes in adult MPS disorders is limited and insufficient for guiding neuropsychology service development. Data on the psychosocial effects of MPS across the lifespan will be crucial for planning service development and supporting the neuropsychological needs of adult patients and their families. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Objective: To explore how permanent compared with absorbable suture affects anatomic success in native tissue vaginal suspension (uterosacral ligament suspension and sacrospinous ligament suspension) and sacrocolpopexy with mesh.DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through March 29, 2022.METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Our population included women undergoing apical prolapse surgery (uterosacral ligament suspension and sacrospinous ligament suspension and abdominal sacrocolpopexy). Our intervention was permanent suture for apical prolapse surgery, and our comparator was absorbable suture. We determined a single anatomic success proportion per study. Adverse events collected included suture and mesh exposure, surgery for suture and mesh complication, dyspareunia, and granulation tissue. Abstracts were doubly screened, full-text articles were doubly screened, and accepted articles were doubly extracted. Quality of studies was assessed using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) criteria. In single-arm studies using either permanent or absorbable suture, random effects meta-analyses of pooled proportions were used to assess anatomic success. In comparative studies investigating both suture types, random effects meta-analyses of pooled risk ratios were used.TABULATION, INTEGRATION, AND RESULTS: Of 4,658 abstracts screened, 398 full-text articles were assessed and 63 studies were included (24 vaginal suspension [13 uterosacral ligament suspension and 11 sacrospinous ligament suspension] and 39 sacrocolpopexy). At 2-year follow-up, there was no difference in permanent compared with absorbable suture in uterosacral ligament suspension and sacrospinous ligament suspension (proportional anatomic success rate 88% [95% CI 0.81-0.93] vs 88% [95% CI 0.82-0.92]). Similarly, at 18-month follow-up, there was no difference in permanent compared with absorbable suture in sacrocolpopexy (proportional anatomic success rate 92% [95% CI 0.88-0.95] vs 96% [95% CI 0.92-0.99]). On meta-analysis, there was no difference in relative risk (RR) of success for permanent compared with absorbable suture for uterosacral ligament suspension and sacrospinous ligament suspension (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.93-1.33) or sacrocolpopexy (RR 1.00, 95% CI0.98-1.03). Conclusion: Success rates were similarly high for absorbable and permanent suture after uterosacral ligament suspension, sacrospinous ligament suspension, and sacrocolpopexy, with medium-term follow-up.  © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Objective: Investigate if integrated exercise and psychosocial (EP) interventions effect self-efficacy to manage pain and self-efficacy for physical functioning compared to alternate interventions, usual care, waitlists and attention controls for individuals with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Methods: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsychINFO, PEDro, and Cochrane Library were searched. Included randomized controlled trials utilized an EP intervention for CLBP and measured self-efficacy. Independent reviewers screened abstracts, reviewed full-texts, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. GRADE, synthesis without meta-analysis, and ranges of effects (Hedges' g) were used. Results: 2207 Participants were included (22-studies). EP interventions positively effected self-efficacy to manage pain short-term compared to usual care (range of effects: −0.02, 0.94) and controls (range of effects: 0.69, 0.80) and intermediately compared to usual care (range of effects: 0.11, 0.29); however, no differences were found when compared to alternate interventions. EP interventions positively effected self-efficacy for physical functioning short-term compared to alternate interventions (range of effects: 0.57, 0.71), usual care (range of effects: −0.15, 0.94), and controls (range of effects: 0.31, 0.56), and intermediately compared to alternate interventions (1-study, effect: 0.57) and controls (1-study, effect: 0.56). Conclusions were limited by low to very low-quality-evidence often from risk of bias, imprecision, and clinical/statistical heterogeneity. Conclusions: EP interventions may be more effective short-term for self-efficacy to manage pain than usual care and waitlists, but not alternate interventions. EP interventions may be effective for self-efficacy for physical functioning at short- and intermediate-term compared to alternate interventions, usual care, waitlist and attention controls. Considerations for future research include methods for blinding and measurement of self-efficacy for physical functioning. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Objective: To assess the retest reliability, predictive validity, and concurrent validity of locomotor and cognitive dual-task cost (DTC) metrics derived from locomotor-cognitive dual-task paradigms. Data Sources: A literature search of electronic databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Scopus) was conducted on May 29th, 2021, without time restriction. Study Selection: For 1559 search results, titles and abstracts were screened by a single reviewer and full text of potentially eligible papers was considered by 2 independent reviewers. 25 studies that evaluated retest reliability, predictive validity, and concurrent validity of locomotor-cognitive DTC in healthy and clinical groups met inclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Study quality was assessed using the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instrument checklist. Data relating to the retest reliability, predictive validity, and concurrent validity of DTC were extracted. Data Synthesis: Meta-analysis showed that locomotor DTC metrics (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]=0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI; 0.53.0.70]) had better retest reliability than cognitive DTC metrics (ICC=0.27, 95% CI [0.17.0.36]). Larger retest reliability estimates were found for temporal gait outcomes (ICC=0.67-0.72) compared with spatial (ICC=0.34-0.53). Motor DTC metrics showed weak predictive validity for the incidence of future falls (r=0.14, 95% CI [-0.03.0.31]). Motor DTC metrics had weak concurrent validity with other clinical and performance assessments (r=0.11, 95% CI [0.07.0.16]), as did cognitive DTC metrics (r=0.19, 95% CI [0.08.0.30]). Conclusions: Gait-related temporal DTC metrics achieve adequate retest reliability, while predictive and concurrent validity of DTC needs to be improved before being used widely in clinical practice and other applied settings. Future research should ensure the reliability and validity of DTC outcomes before being used to assess dual-task interference. © 2022 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine"
"Background: Smartphone use during postural-locomotor tasks is an everyday activity for individuals of all ages in diverse environmental situations and with various health conditions. Nevertheless, the use of smartphones during walking is responsible for many accidents. Research question: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined spatiotemporal gait parameters during the dual-task situation “texting + gait” versus isolated gait task (single task) in adult persons (>18 years). Methods: Electronic database searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, CINHAL, and LISSA. Two examiners assessed the eligibility and quality of appraisal with the Downs and Black checklist. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95 % confidence intervals was calculated to compare single- and dual-task situations. The pooled estimates of the overall effect were computed using a random or fixed effects method, and forest plots were generated. Results and significance: A total of 25 studies were included. All studies included healthy adults, with four studies including older persons and three including people with pathological conditions. The walking task was with (N = 4) and without (N = 21) obstacles and in laboratory (N = 21) or ecological conditions (N = 7). The quality scores were 6–8/16 for eight studies, 9–12/16 for seven studies, and more than 12/16 for three studies. During the “texting + gait” tasks, the meta-analysis highlighted a significant impairment of gait speed, step and stride length, cadence, and double and single support (p < 0.05). The spatiotemporal parameters of gait were systematically altered during the texting task regardless of the population and test conditions. However, the quality of the studies is moderate, and few studies have been conducted for people with motor deficiencies. The impact of texting on walking should be better considered to develop prevention actions. © 2023 The Authors"
"OBJECTIVE To understand the effects of nutrition security and social determinants of health (SDOHs) on pressure injury (PI) progression through a scoping review and retrospective review of patients reporting to New England's largest healthcare system. METHODS Authors performed a scoping review for full-text, original articles reporting outcomes data specific to PIs in patients with socially informed nutrition insecurity. Investigators also performed a retrospective review of all patients from 2012 to 2021 to search for patients with PI documentation and International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision Z codes related to the SDOHs. RESULTS A full-text review of 2,323 articles from 1965 to 2020 failed to locate any eligible studies. Investigators identified 1,044 patients who met the inclusion criteria; 50.7% were men, 74.3% were White, and 13.3% had evidence of detrimental SDOHs. The average PI duration was 12.13 days (interquartile range, 6 days). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that PI duration was longer in men, Black patients, and patients with evidence of detrimental SDOHs compared with their converse counterparts (P <.0001). The presence of detrimental SDOHs independently predicted an increased duration of disease by 13.07 days (95% CI, 8.99-17.15; t = 6.29, P <.0001). CONCLUSIONS A patient's SDOH history has a significant and considerably stronger correlation with disease progression than predictors that are traditionally studied such as sex, race, or body mass index. These findings are novel, as highlighted by the absence of data uncovered in the literature. These data carry relevance for plastic surgeons wishing to prevent early recurrence following operative closure of PI-related wounds.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved."
"Based on 29,192,662 html files obtained from the ClueWeb a bi-gram data language model for Arabic is constructed. The created dataset is considering standard types of bi-gram analysis, however with focus on the root1-pattern2 paradigm in Arabic. Root-Pattern distributions in form of P(root|pattern), P(pattern|root) and P(pattern|pattern) are additionally estimated. The aspect of considering the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) on the root-pattern level as a higher-level of abstraction, has been widely neglected in Arabic research community despite its advantage in reducing ambiguities within Arabic morphological analysis and its impact on cognitive aspect on Arabic word perception [1]. In the preprocessing phase, the html files were converted to 974 unfiltered raw text files with the size of about 180 GB. These files were morphologically analyzed towards extracting and counting frequencies of patterns, roots, particle, and stems and particularly root-pattern occurrences. Based on a resulting corpus containing around 18,482,719 raw words, a language data model is constructed containing 9,311,246 bi-grams of morphologically analyzed wordform, including around 3.49 million bi-directional P(root|pattern) and around 1.153 million P(patttern|pattern) bi-grams in form of conditional probabilities covering a subset of around 8086 roots with 20413 possible pattern-forms. As this data model is considering the root–pattern phenomenon in Arabic, the created data are useful for researchers working on cognitive aspect of Arabic such as visual word cognition, morpho-phonetic perception, morphological analysis, spell-checking, and resolving ambiguities in morphological parsing. © 2023 The Author(s)"
"Background:Contemporary first-line antiretrovirals have considerably reduced liability for clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDI). This systematic review evaluates the prevalence of DDI among people receiving antiretrovirals across 3 decades.Methods:We searched 3 databases for studies reporting the prevalence of clinically significant DDIs in patients receiving antiretrovirals published between January 1987 and July 2022. Clinically significant DDIs were graded by severity. All data extractions were undertaken by 2 independent reviewers, adjudicated by a third.Results:Of 21,665 records returned, 13,474 were duplicates. After screening the remaining 13,596 abstracts against inclusion criteria, 122 articles were included for full-text analysis, from which a final list of 34 articles were included for data synthesis. The proportion of patients experiencing a clinically significant DDI did not change over time (P = 0.072). The most frequently reported classes of antiretrovirals involved in DDIs were protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors; of note, integrase use in the most recent studies was highly variable and ranged between 0% and 89%.Conclusions:The absolute risk of DDIs has not decreased over the period covered. This is likely related to continued use of older regimens and an ageing cohort of patients. A greater reduction in DDI prevalence can be anticipated with broader uptake of regimens containing unboosted integrase inhibitors or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Objectives: It is not unusual for Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) lesions that have similar clinical presentation and staging to have dissimilar radiographic extent of disease. The aim of this review was to explore the published scientific literature for quantitative indices that describe the cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) radiographic features of MRONJ lesions and assess their clinical utility. Method and Materials: A scoping review of the literature was performed to identify quantitative indices developed to describe the CBCT radiographic features of MRONJ lesions. Five electronic databases were included in the review: PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Trip medical database, and Cochrane Library. Articles published from the year 2003 onward were included in the review. Results: 367 articles were initially included in the review. 39 abstracts were screened for full-text assessment. The scoping review yielded 12 full length articles with169 cases reported. The Composite Radiographic Index score (CRI score) was identified as the most meaningful index in published literature that attempted to quantify qualitative radiographic changes (Walton, Grogan et al. 2019). However, lesions with similar CRI scores that corresponded to intermediate severity (3–5) may be very dissimilar radiographically in both nature and extent of radiographic changes, undercutting its clinical value. Conclusion: The CRI index score was the only relevant index for cross-sectional (one-time) assessment of established MRONJ lesions (non-stage 0). This scoping review yielded several critical questions regarding the clinical significance and prognostic implications of various radiographic changes in MRONJ, thereby identifying focus areas for future research. © 2022 The Authors"
"OBJECTIVES: Diagnosis of pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) in resource-limited settings (RLS) is challenging and remains poorly described. We conducted a review of the literature to optimize recognition of PARDS in RLS and to provide recommendations/statements for clinical practice and future research in these settings as part of the Second Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference (PALICC-2). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), and CINAHL Complete (EBSCOhost). STUDY SELECTION: We included studies related to precipitating factors for PARDS, mechanical ventilation (MV), pulmonary and nonpulmonary ancillary treatments, and long-term outcomes in children who survive PARDS in RLS. DATA EXTRACTION: Title/abstract review, full-text review, and data extraction using a standardized data collection form. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach was used to identify and summarize evidence and develop recommendations. Seventy-seven studies were identified for full-text extraction. We were unable to identify any literature on which to base recommendations. We gained consensus on six clinical statements (good practice, definition, and policy) and five research statements. Clinicians should be aware of diseases and comorbidities, uncommon in most high-income settings, that predispose to the development of PARDS in RLS. Because of difficulties in recognizing PARDS and to avoid underdiagnosis, the PALICC-2 possible PARDS definition allows exclusion of imaging criteria when all other criteria are met, including noninvasive metrics of hypoxemia. The availability of MV support, regular MV training and education, as well as accessibility and costs of pulmonary and nonpulmonary ancillary therapies are other concerns related to management of PARDS in RLS. Data on long-term outcomes and feasibility of follow-up in PARDS survivors from RLS are also lacking. CONCLUSIONS: To date, PARDS remains poorly described in RLS. Clinicians working in these settings should be aware of common precipitating factors for PARDS in their patients. Future studies utilizing the PALICC-2 definitions are urgently needed to describe the epidemiology, management, and outcomes of PARDS in RLS. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Smart cities have become an influential concept in urban development. Smart cities and their applications aim to maintain a high quality of life by using smart technologies and enhancing economic productivity. Previous systematic literature reviews have considered the development of smart cities and highlighted their applications and services. However, no prior studies have comprehensively investigated smart cities in relation to emergencies. To this end, the current paper aims to provide a research agenda reviewing the relevant literature that touches on smart technologies during emergencies like the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Based on a systematic methodology centred on text mining analysis, our research identified the following three themes: (a) emergency response, which covers emergency management, traffic and unmanned aerial vehicles, waste disposal, and contact tracing; (b) motivation and outcome, which includes such sub-themes as smart urbanism, quality of life and the economy; and (c) technology and data, which covers social media, machine learning, Internet of Things, data-driven applications, and object detection. We comprehensively discuss each theme and offer suggestions for future research. © 2023"
"Objective: The aim of this review was to examine the literature to identify what is known about midwives’ experiences as academics and their perspectives of transition from clinical practice to university. Introduction: Literature on health care practitioners, particularly nurses’ transition from clinical experts to novice teachers suggests the transition to academia is challenging.Challenges reported by research studies have identified stress, uncertainty, and lack of a supportive and structured transition. There was a dearth of primary research evidence of midwives’ perspectives. Methods: A scoping review using the Johanna Briggs Institute three step approach was employed. First, an initial limited search of Google Scholar and CINAHL was undertaken to identify articles on the topic. Second, the text words contained in the titles and abstracts of relevant articles and the index terms used to describe the articles were used to develop a complete search strategy in databases: EMBASE, MIDIRS, Scopus and PubMed. Finally, a manual search of the reference lists of all included sources of evidence was manually searched for additional studies. Results: Ten papers that included midwives as the participants were located from Australia, The United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA) between 2006 and 2022. Analysis of the findings led to three themes: Theme 1: Challenges associated with the transition; Theme 2: Dichotomy of identity; and Theme 3: Fear of losing clinical credibility. Conclusion: In most studies midwives formed a subset of the sample meaning that the voices of midwifery academics are minimised by the experiences of other health practitioners. However, in depth details were located from four personal reflections which identified that transition from clinical practice to academia can result in a duality of roles while individuals come to terms with their new reality and overcome their fear of losing credibility as clinicians. New academics from health tend to hold onto their identity as clinicians rather than adopting their new persona as academics. Fear of losing credibility stems from the need to maintain competence for continued professional registration as clinicians. Further research is needed which focuses on midwives as the target sample to validate the research evidence from this scoping review. © 2023"
"Advanced heart failure (HF) is associated with a very poor prognosis and places a big burden on health-care services. The gold standard treatment, i.e. long-term mechanical circulatory support or heart transplantation, is precluded in many patients but observational studies suggest that the use of SNP might be associated with favourable long-term clinical outcomes. We performed a metanalysis of published studies that compared sodium nitroprusside (SNP) with optimal medical therapy to examine the safety and efficacy of SNP as part of the treatment regimen of patients hospitalized for advanced heart failure (HF). We searched PUBMED, EMBASE and WEB OF SCIENCE for studies that compared SNP with optimal medical therapy in advanced HF on July 2022. After screening 700 full-text articles, data from two original articles were included in a combined analysis. The analysis demonstrated a 66% reduction in the odds of death in advanced HF patients treated with SNP. The results show the potential importance of the inclusion of SNP in the treatment regimen of patients hospitalized because of advanced HF and underlines that controlled, randomized studies are still required in this condition. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Introduction: Many older people experience memory concerns; a minority receive a diagnosis of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Subjective Cognitive decline (SCD). There are concerns that medicalisation of MCI and memory concern may fail to acknowledge subjective experiences. Aim: We explore the meaning individuals give to their memory concerns, with or without a diagnosis of MCI and SCD. Method: We scoped literature exploring subjective experiences of memory concern, with or without a diagnosis of MCI or SCD. We searched CINAHL, PsycINFO and MEDLINE in March 2020, and updated in Sept 2021.We used (Arksey & O’Malley, 2005) framework to guide our scoping review method and thematic analysis to analyse our findings. Results: We screened 12,033 search results reviewing the full texts of 92 papers. We included 24 papers, including a total of 453 participants, the majority of whom were female, from White ethnic majority populations (or from studies where ethnicity was not identified) with high levels of education. In 15 out of 24 studies, 272 participants were diagnosed with MCI. We identified two themes; Making a diagnosis personal and Remembering not to forget. We found that subjective experiences include normative comparison with others of the same age and responses including fear, relief, and acceptance, but culminating in uncertainty. Conclusion: Drawing upon sociology, we highlight the subjective experiences of living with memory concerns, SCD and an MCI diagnosis. We identify a gap between the intended purpose of diagnostic labels to bring understanding and certainty and the lived experiences of those ascribed them. © The Author(s) 2022."
"The skeleton shows the local symmetry and the shape/topology of the object, and it is utilized for human pose recognition, road detection, text detection, and the representation of industrial parts. However, the size of the skeleton is variable, which makes high-level feature representation difficult. Existing methods only attempt to integrate multilevel features but ignore the extraction of high-level features and multiscales of contextual information that are helpful for the skeleton detection task. Thus, the contributions of this article include two aspects. The first contribution is to propose a nested densely atrous spatial pyramid pooling method that connects the atrous convolutions with different dilation rates in a nested cascade mode, which can provide the multiscale denser contextual information, a larger receptive field, and more local features. The second one is to propose a deep dense short connection (DDSC) that explores the role of features at different levels in the task of skeleton detection. DDSC adopts concatenation to fuse high-level semantic information with shape information. The proposed method is evaluated on four common datasets, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2022 IEEE."
"This article presents the findings of a study undertaken by a team of three film studies teacher-researchers working with undergraduate students in a course titled ‘Histories of Film Theory’. In the context of the transition from face-to-face to remote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors observed that students’ approaches to understanding relevant film theories became increasingly inflected by their experiences of contrasting methods of course delivery, such as that between the cinema theatre or home viewing environment. To investigate this effect, the authors conducted a study of student experience across the 2020 and 2021 cohorts; the purpose was to understand how the shift to online learning shaped students’ engagement with set film texts, by analysing the behaviour exhibited when accessing film texts remotely. The study is grounded in the observation that there is an existing body of film theory on screen spectatorship that has potential significance to a scholarly understanding of the pedagogical complexity of online learning and multimodal literacies. This scholarship ranges from analyses of ‘traditional’ reception environments (Baudry 1974), to accounts of the differentiation in modes of attention introduced by new media (Ellis 1992, Cavell 1982), to analyses of the multiplying second screen practices of the digital era (Casetti 2011). A governing distinction highlighted in the results is between ‘gazing’, the mode of spectatorship associated with the traditional cinema experience, and ‘glancing’, the mode associated with home viewing and second screen use. Were the students in the course gazing or glancing, and how did this affect their encounters with films and characterize their remote learning experience more broadly? In asking these questions, the article demonstrates how the intellectual resources of film studies might be applied to contemporary digital pedagogy scholarship to reveal a complex scenario in which remote learning practices both hinder and enhance learning experiences, sometimes simultaneously. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Urban environmental legislation is an important institutional arrangement to ensure the orderly progress of ecological civilization construction. It will also affect corporate environmental performance (CEP) due to more binding environmental regulation measures. Firstly, this paper clarifies the theoretical logic and mechanism of the impact of urban environmental legislation on CEP. Secondly, we matched the data of 3642 listed firms from 2010 to 2019 with the panel data of 277 prefecture-level cities, conducted a quasi-natural experiment based on urban environmental legislation, and used the differential-in-difference model (DID) to test the above mechanism. The results show that urban environmental legislation can significantly improve CEP. Our heterogeneity analyses show that urban environmental legislation more significantly impacts firms with strong debt financing ability, perfect internal governance structure, and low equity concentration. The mechanism test demonstrates that urban environmental legislation improves CEP directly by increasing environmental investment and indirectly by increasing media and public attention. According to a quantitative analysis of 714 urban environmental legislation texts, urban environmental legislation has a significant positive impact on corporate environmental operation performance focusing on terminal governance but no significant impact on corporate environmental management performance focusing on process control. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Background: Different types of educational approaches are needed to build a mentor's competence in guiding students during clinical practice; this education should be provided in an interprofessional setting. Objectives: The objective of this review was to evaluate how effective mentoring education interventions are at improving mentoring competence among health care professionals. Design: A systematic review. Data sources: A systematic search was conducted across five electronic databases: CINAHL, PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, and Medic. The search did not have any time limitations and included original studies published in English, Finnish or Swedish. Review methods: JBI critical appraisal tools for quasi-experimental studies and randomized controlled trials were used to assess the quality of the selected studies. The eligibility of potentially relevant studies was assessed by two independent researchers based on title, abstract, and full text, along with overall methodological quality. The study findings were synthesized using data tabulation and narrative analysis. Results: A total of two randomized controlled trials and six quasi-experimental studies were included in the review. The described mentoring education interventions were carried out in university hospitals, central hospitals, tertiary care centers, and other health service settings. All of the described educational interventions involved the pedagogical method of blended learning, while three studies also involved web-based learning. The presented educational interventions included versatile pedagogical frameworks, e.g., interactive practical training sessions, teaching workshops, and technology-mediated interactions. One study contained a control group. Conclusion: This systematic review can provide insight and evidence-based that can be used to design effective mentoring education. Further research is needed and would ideally include randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies with reference groups; this type of research could further elucidate which aspects of mentoring education are most important for improving the guidance skills of health care professionals. © 2023 The Authors"
"The aim is to clarify the evolution mechanism of Network Public Opinion (NPO) in public emergencies. This work makes up for the insufficient semantic understanding in NPO-oriented emotion analysis and tries to maintain social harmony and stability. The combination of the Edge Computing (EC) and Deep Learning (DL) model is applied to the NPO-oriented Emotion Recognition Model (ERM). Firstly, the NPO on public emergencies is introduced. Secondly, three types of NPO emergencies are selected as research cases. An emotional rule system is established based on the One-Class Classification (OCC) model as emotional standards. The word embedding representation method represents the preprocessed Weibo text data. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used as the classifier. The NPO-oriented ERM is implemented on CNN and verified through comparative experiments after the CNN's hyperparameters are adjusted. The research results show that the text annotation of the NPO based on OCC emotion rules can obtain better recognition performance. Additionally, the recognition effect of the improved CNN is significantly higher than the Support Vector Machine (SVM) in traditional Machine Learning (ML). This work realizes the technological innovation of automatic emotion recognition of NPO groups and provides a basis for the relevant government agencies to handle the NPO in public emergencies scientifically. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"We investigated the effect of uncertainty associated with infectious diseases on corporate dividend policy. We used a unique text-based measure of infectious diseases that includes not only the Covid-19, but also other important diseases, such as SARs, MERs, and Ebola. Based on a sample of 287,151 firm-year observations across four decades (from 1985 to 2021), our results show that a higher level of uncertainty associated with infectious diseases significantly reduce dividends. Interestingly, we also found that having more independent directors on the board mitigates the negative effect of uncertainty associated with infectious diseases on dividends which implies that the reduction in dividends was partly driven by agency conflicts. We performed several robustness checks which confirm that our findings are unlikely to be affected by endogeneity issues. © 2023 Ungpakorn et al.

"We propose and demonstrate an accurate demodulation method for fiber-optic interferometric sensors (FOISs) by utilizing an expanded free spectral range (EFSR). Unlike conventional demodulation schemes, this method selects a pair of resonant wavelengths (peaks or dips) with an interval of multiple free spectral ranges (FSRs) to determine the optical path difference (OPD) of the FOIS. This demodulation method significantly improves the measurement accuracy of the FOIS while maintaining a fast processing speed. The feasibility of the proposed method is experimentally demonstrated by our recently developed fiber-optic piezometer using a 178- \mu \text{m} -gap air extrinsic Fabry-Perot interferometer (EFPI). Liquid level measurement in the range of 0-90 cm with a step of 15 cm is conducted with this method, and the experimental results demonstrate improved performance in terms of linearity, standard error (SE), and resolution. The measurement resolution increases significantly from 8.57 to 1.48 cm when the EFSR orders vary from 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, to 20. To further validate the proposed method, the measurement in the range of 0-24 cm with a step of 4 cm is performed for comparison, and the resolution is exponentially improved from a failed state to as high as 0.41 cm. Furthermore, five sets of historical data are chosen to establish regression models, and the results are consistent with the rest 14 sets of measured data. The proposed demodulation method is precise, rapid, and versatile, which would be useful in the further development and application of FOISs.  © 2001-2012 IEEE."
"OBJECTIVES: Balancing the risks of hypotension and vasopressor-associated adverse effects is a daily challenge in ICUs. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to examine the effect of lower versus higher exposure to vasopressor therapy on mortality among adult ICU patients with vasodilatory hypotension. DATA SOURCES: We searched Ovid Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for studies published from inception to October 15, 2021. STUDY SELECTION: We included randomized controlled trials of lower versus higher exposure to vasopressor therapy in adult ICU patients with vasodilatory hypotension without language or publication status limits. DATA EXTRACTION: The primary outcome was 90-day all-cause mortality, with seven prespecified subgroups. Secondary outcomes included shorter- and longer-term mortality, use of life-sustaining therapies, vasopressor-related complications, neurologic outcome, and quality of life at longest reported follow-up. We conducted random-effects meta-analyses to calculate summary effect measures across individual studies (risk ratio [RR] for dichotomous variables, mean difference for continuous variables, both with 95% CIs). The certainty of the evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation. We registered this review on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42021224434). DATA SYNTHESIS: Of 3,403 records retrieved, 68 full-text articles were reviewed and three eligible studies included. Lower exposure to vasopressors probably lowers 90-day mortality but this is based on moderate-certainty evidence, lowered for imprecision (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87-1.02). There was no credible subgroup effect. Lower vasopressor exposure may also decrease the risk of supraventricular arrhythmia (odds ratio, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.36-0.86; low certainty). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with vasodilatory hypotension who are started on vasopressors, moderate-certainty evidence from three randomized trials showed that lower vasopressor exposure probably lowers mortality. However, additional trial data are needed to reach an optimal information size to detect a clinically important 10% relative reduction in mortality with this approach. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"The challenge of assessing semantic similarity between pieces of text through computers has attracted considerable attention from industry and academia. New advances in neural computation have developed very sophisticated concepts, establishing a new state of the art in this respect. In this paper, we go one step further by proposing new techniques built on the existing methods. To do so, we bring to the table the stacking concept that has given such good results and propose a new architecture for ensemble learning based on genetic programming. As there are several possible variants, we compare them all and try to establish which one is the most appropriate to achieve successful results in this context. Analysis of the experiments indicates that Cartesian Genetic Programming seems to give better average results.  © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Company."
"BACKGROUNDPatient safety is a key concern of anaesthesiology practice. However, good practices are often not widely shared between departments and hospitals, whether within or between countries.OBJECTIVEWe aimed to collect and analyse safety practices and tips from anaesthesiology departments around Europe in order to facilitate successful transfer of safety knowledge.DESIGNReview of previously collected safety practices; allocation of numerical scores in order to rank them on 0-5 scales in terms of anticipated impact, and speed, cost, and ease of implementation; free text comment on any possible difficulties or unintended harms which might arise from adopting any of the collected practices.SETTINGCollaborative remote working of expert group.PARTICIPANTSNineteen experts in patient safety in anaesthesiology from nine European countries.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESRankings of safety practices for anticipated practice impact, cost, speed, and ease of implementation.RESULTSWe collected 117 practices. The highest-ranked items for potential beneficial impact were: standardising the layout of drug trolleys (4.82); involving all staff in new safety initiatives in the operating theatre (4.73); ensuring patients' medical records are available at the time of surgery (4.71); running regular simulation training sessions in departments of anaesthesia (4.67); and creating a difficult airway management trolley (4.65). A major theme to emerge from the qualitative analysis of the experts' free text comments was the risk that practices aimed at enhancing patient safety might not achieve the effect intended, as introducing new safety activities can cause more mistakes during the implementation phase.CONCLUSIONMany useful practices to promote patient safety were identified, but as some practices appear to be context-dependent, we recommend that a proper, prospective risk assessment is carried out before they are introduced in a new setting.

"OBJECTIVE: To provide evidence for the Second Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference updated recommendations and consensus statements for clinical practice and future research on invasive mechanical ventilation support of patients with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS). DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), and CINAHL Complete (EBSCOhost). STUDY SELECTION: We included clinical studies of critically ill patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation for PARDS, January 2013 to April 2022. In addition, meta-Analyses and systematic reviews focused on the adult acute respiratory distress syndrome population were included to explore new relevant concepts (e.g., mechanical power, driving pressure, etc.) still underrepresented in the contemporary pediatric literature. DATA EXTRACTION: Title/abstract review, full text review, and data extraction using a standardized data collection form. DATA SYNTHESIS: The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to identify and summarize relevant evidence and develop recommendations, good practice statements and research statements. We identified 26 pediatric studies for inclusion and 36 meta-Analyses or systematic reviews in adults. We generated 12 recommendations, two research statements, and five good practice statements related to modes of ventilation, tidal volume, ventilation pressures, lung-protective ventilation bundles, driving pressure, mechanical power, recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, and high-frequency ventilation. Only one recommendation, related to use of positive end-expiratory pressure, is classified as strong, with moderate certainty of evidence. CONCLUSIONS: Limited pediatric data exist to make definitive recommendations for the management of invasive mechanical ventilation for patients with PARDS. Ongoing research is needed to better understand how to guide best practices and improve outcomes for patients with PARDS requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

"Objective: Neurosurgical cadaveric and simulation training is a valuable opportunity for residents and fellows to develop as neurosurgeons, further neuroanatomy knowledge, and develop decision-making and technical expertise. The authors describe the growth and development of Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU) Department of Neurological Surgery (NSG) resident hands-on simulation skull base course and provide details of course layout and setup. Methods: A three-part surgical simulation series was created to provide training in cadaveric skull base procedures. Course objectives were outlined for participants. Residents participated in NSG hands-on simulation courses (years 2015–2020) and completed annual course curriculum and anonymous course evaluations, which included free text reviews. Courses were evaluated by Likert scale analysis within Python, and free text was quantified using Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (VADER). Descriptive statistics were calculated and plotted using Python's Seaborn and Matplotlib library modules. Results: Analysis included 162 skull base (anterior fossa, middle fossa and lateral, and endoscopic endonasal-based) simulation course evaluations. Resident responses were overwhelmingly positive. Likert responses demonstrated high average responses for each question (4.62 ± 0.56 and above). A positive attitude about simulation courses is supported by an average compound sentiment value of 0.558 ± 0.285. Conclusion: This is the first time Likert responses and sentiment analysis have been used to demonstrate how neurosurgical residents view a comprehensive, multi-year hands-on simulation training program. We hope the information presented serves as a guide for other institutions to develop their own residency educational curriculum in cadaveric skull base procedures. © 2023"
"Even though Helicobacter pylori infection was the most causative factor of gastric cancer, numerous in vivo studies failed to induce gastric cancer using H. pylori infection only. The utilization of established animal studies in cancer research is crucial as they aim to investigate the coincidental association between suspected oncogenes and pathogenesis as well as generate models for the development and testing of potential treatments. The methods to establish gastric cancer using infected animal models remain limited, diverse in methods, and showed different results. This study investigates the differences in animal models, which highlight different pathological results in gaster by literature research. Electronic databases searched were performed in PubMed, Science Direct, and Cochrane, without a period filter. A total of 135 articles were used in this study after a full-text assessment was conducted. The most frequent animal models used for gastric cancer were Mice, while Mongolian gerbils and Transgenic mice were the most susceptible model for gastric cancer associated with H. pylori infection. Additionally, transgenic mice showed that the susceptibility to gastric cancer progression was due to genetic and epigenetic factors. These studies showed that in Mongolian gerbil models, H. pylori could function as a single agent to trigger stomach cancer. However, most gastric cancer susceptibilities were not solely relying on H. pylori infection, and numerous factors are involved in cancer progression. Further study using Mongolian gerbils and Transgenic mice is crucial to conduct and establish the best models for gastric cancer associated H. pylori. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Background: Convalescent plasma may reduce mortality in patients with viral respiratory diseases, and is being investigated as a potential therapy for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). A thorough understanding of the current body of evidence regarding benefits and risks of this intervention is required. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in the treatment of people with COVID-19; and to maintain the currency of the evidence using a living systematic review approach. Search methods: To identify completed and ongoing studies, we searched the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 Global literature on coronavirus disease Research Database, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register, and the Epistemonikos COVID-19 L*OVE Platform. We searched monthly until 03 March 2022. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating convalescent plasma for COVID-19, irrespective of disease severity, age, gender or ethnicity. We excluded studies that included populations with other coronavirus diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)), as well as studies evaluating standard immunoglobulin. Data collection and analysis: We followed standard Cochrane methodology. To assess bias in included studies we used RoB 2. We used the GRADE approach to rate the certainty of evidence for the following outcomes: all-cause mortality at up to day 28, worsening and improvement of clinical status (for individuals with moderate to severe disease), hospital admission or death, COVID-19 symptoms resolution (for individuals with mild disease), quality of life, grade 3 or 4 adverse events, and serious adverse events. Main results: In this fourth review update version, we included 33 RCTs with 24,861 participants, of whom 11,432 received convalescent plasma. Of these, nine studies are single-centre studies and 24 are multi-centre studies. Fourteen studies took place in America, eight in Europe, three in South-East Asia, two in Africa, two in western Pacific and three in eastern Mediterranean regions and one in multiple regions. We identified a further 49 ongoing studies evaluating convalescent plasma, and 33 studies reporting as being completed. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and moderate to severe disease. 29 RCTs investigated the use of convalescent plasma for 22,728 participants with moderate to severe disease. 23 RCTs with 22,020 participants compared convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, five compared to standard plasma and one compared to human immunoglobulin. We evaluate subgroups on detection of antibodies detection, symptom onset, country income groups and several co-morbidities in the full text. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone. Convalescent plasma does not reduce all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.92 to 1.03; 220 per 1000; 21 RCTs, 19,021 participants; high-certainty evidence). It has little to no impact on need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.11; 296 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 14,477 participants; high-certainty evidence) and has no impact on whether participants are discharged from hospital (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.02; 665 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 12,721 participants; high-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on quality of life (MD 1.00, 95% CI −2.14 to 4.14; 1 RCT, 483 participants; low-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no impact on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.42; 212 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 2392 participants; low-certainty evidence). It has probably little to no effect on the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.44; 135 per 1000; 6 RCTs, 3901 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.19; 129 per 1000; 4 RCTs, 484 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces or increases the need for invasive mechanical ventilation, or death (RR 5.59, 95% CI 0.29 to 108.38; 311 per 1000; 1 study, 34 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and whether it reduces or increases the risk of serious adverse events (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.15; 236 per 1000; 3 RCTs, 327 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus human immunoglobulin. Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.50; 464 per 1000; 1 study, 190 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Individuals with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection and mild disease. We identified two RCTs reporting on 536 participants, comparing convalescent plasma to placebo or standard care alone, and two RCTs reporting on 1597 participants with mild disease, comparing convalescent plasma to standard plasma. Convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (odds ratio (OR) 0.36, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.46; 8 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 536 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It may have little to no effect on admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.84; 117 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on time to COVID-19 symptom resolution (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.30; 483 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence), on the risk of grades 3 and 4 adverse events (RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.19; 144 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence) and the risk of serious adverse events (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.94; 133 per 1000; 1 RCT, 376 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. Convalescent plasma versus standard plasma. We are uncertain whether convalescent plasma reduces all-cause mortality at up to day 28 (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.05 to 1.75; 2 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1597 participants; very low-certainty evidence). It probably reduces admission to hospital or death within 28 days (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.75; 36 per 1000; 2 RCTs, 1595 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Convalescent plasma may have little to no effect on initial symptom resolution at up to day 28 (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.27; 1 RCT, 416 participants; low-certainty evidence). We did not identify any study reporting other key outcomes. This is a living systematic review. We search monthly for new evidence and update the review when we identify relevant new evidence. Authors' conclusions: For the comparison of convalescent plasma versus placebo or standard care alone, our certainty in the evidence that convalescent plasma for individuals with moderate to severe disease does not reduce mortality and has little to no impact on clinical improvement or worsening is high. It probably has little to no effect on SAEs. For individuals with mild disease, we have low certainty evidence for our primary outcomes. There are 49 ongoing studies, and 33 studies reported as complete in a trials registry. Publication of ongoing studies might resolve some of the uncertainties around convalescent plasma therapy for people with asymptomatic or mild disease. Copyright © 2023 The Cochrane Collaboration.

"Background: Despite fire prevention protocols and perioperative staff training, surgical fires continue to cause patient harm, disability, and death. Methods: We identified surgical fires that were reported to the Food and Drug Administration's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database between 2000 and 2020 that resulted in patient or surgical personnel harm. Quantitative and descriptive content analyses were performed on free-text responses to identify contributing factors of surgical fire patient and personnel harm events. Results: We identified 565 surgical fire events resulting in patient or surgical personnel harm over a 20-year study period (median 25 events/year; range, 8–53). Surgical fires were significantly more likely to occur during upper aerodigestive tract (unadjusted odds ratio 15.96; 95% confidence interval, 11.93–21.34) and head and neck (unadjusted odds ratio 5.47; confidence interval 4.14–7.22) procedures compared with abdomen and pelvis procedures. Upper aerodigestive tract and head and neck procedures had the highest incidence of life-threatening injury (41% and 21%, respectively). An electrosurgical device was the ignition source in 82% of events. Content analysis revealed 7 common categories identified as root causes of surgical fires: preparation of surgical site (n = 55, 29%); device malfunction (n = 51, 26%), surgical accident (n = 47, 24%), medical judgement (n = 44 reports, 23%), equipment care and handling (n = 18, 9%), patient factors (n = 10, 5%), and communication (n = 3, 2%). Conclusion: Surgical fires resulting in harm to patient and surgical personnel continue to occur. The common themes identified in this study will prepare and empower surgeons and surgical personnel to prevent surgical fires in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Background: The role of the nurse scientist in the clinical setting is not well defined, which contributes to variability in role implementation, scope, administration, funding, and affiliation across healthcare sites. Aims: The aim of this scoping review was to identify attributes of the clinical nurse scientist role and its operationalization in the clinical setting through available evidence. Methods: A comprehensive, computerized search of the literature in PubMed, Medline, and CINAHL was conducted in early May 2020 by a medical research librarian and repeated in July 2021 and April 2022. The 5-step framework described by Arskey and O'Malley guided the review methodology. Two reviewers conducted an independent screen of all articles, followed by a full-text review of eligible articles by two independent reviewers each using a standardized data extraction template. Themes were then organized and synthesized using descriptive content analysis from the included articles. Results: A final sample of 55 full-text articles were included in the review. Overall, the findings suggest that the nurse scientist role in a clinical setting can be challenging to implement in complex healthcare environments. Successful models include the nurse scientist in a leadership role, alignment of research with institutional priorities, and strong support from senior leadership. Linking Evidence to Action: Findings suggest that standardized guidelines are lacking to govern the implementation of the nurse scientist role in the clinical setting. To succeed, the nurse scientist role must be valued and supported by organizational leaders. Further, access to resources to build infrastructure must be provided. The magnitude and scope of individual organizational support can be tailored based on the resources of the institution; however, the foundation of having institutional leadership support is critical to role success of the clinical nurse researcher. © 2023 Sigma Theta Tau International."
"Intelligent robot becomes a trend for giving education and entertainment around the world, whereas humans are used to interact with Natural Language (NL) in the social context. This paper presents research on the development of speech recognition for Cat robots named as ANITA V4 focused on promotion using minimum storage. As part of social robot, Cat robot should have the features for giving information about majors in the faculties and schools with natural interaction with prospective students. Speech recognition is still difficult because of sources of variation such as number of types of words in vocabulary, intonation and only tuned on specific speaker. To solve those problems, we use hardware-based speech recognition trained with different speaker and general text to speech systems module for giving response to user using Indonesian language. The experimental results and analysis were presented, and we are sure this model of robot can be used widely on marketing department and education at the university. The comparative experiments with 3 persons show that the system is able to respond question from user. © 2023 ICIC International."
"Background: A worldwide shortage of nurses providing clinical care, coupled with an increase in severity of illness of hospitalised patients has led to newly graduated Registered Nurses being placed into high acuity settings, such as the emergency department, intensive care unit and operating theatre. The feeling of belonging in these settings impacts on successful transition of newly graduated Registered Nurses, their learning, and may lead to high attrition rates. Objective: To comprehensively synthesise qualitative research on newly graduated Registered Nurses' experiences of belonging, while working in high acuity clinical settings. Design: Elements of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) systematic review protocol were utilised. The Preferred Reporting Items of Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to conduct the review. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Data sources: Ovid Emcare, PsychInfo, CINHAL, Proquest and Scopus. Methods: The PICo (population, interest and context) strategy was used as a guide to develop search terms. Published literature from January 2007 to April 2021 was searched. Screening, selection and data extraction were performed by two authors independently. All discrepancies were resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. Results: A total of 506 studies were identified following the systematic search; after duplicates were removed, 440 were screened by title and abstract and 29 by full text. Six articles were included in this systematic review. Methodological quality was assessed utilising the JBI critical appraisal checklist, and discrepancies ratified through team consensus. The themes; emotional lability, structured program design, preceptors' influence and acceptance were identified. Conclusions: Newly graduated Registered Nurses in the high acuity setting feel emotionally insecure related mainly to their educational unpreparedness. They have need for a structured program, inclusive of both theory and supported practice. The role of the preceptorship team is vital in enabling a feeling of belonging, as is acceptance by nursing staff of the learning journey. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Mathematics education is like many scientific disciplines witnessing an increase in scientific output. Examining and reviewing every paper in an area in detail are time-consuming, making comprehensive reviews a challenging task. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms like topic models have become increasingly popular in recent years. Their ability to summarize large amounts of unstructured text into coherent themes or topics allows researchers in any field to keep an overview of state of the art by creating automated literature reviews. In this article, we apply topic modeling in the context of mathematics education and showcase the use of this data science approach for creating literature reviews by training a model of all papers (n = 336) that have been presented in Thematic Working Groups related to technology in the first eleven Congresses of the European Society for Research in Mathematics Education (CERME). We guide the reader through the stepwise process of training a model and give recommendations for best practices and decisions that are decisive for the success of such an approach to a literature review. We find that research in this period revolved around 25 distinct topics that can be grouped into four clusters: digital tools, teachers and their resources, technology experimentation, and a diverse cluster with a strong focus on student activity. Finally, a temporal analysis of these topics reveals a correlation between technology trends and research focus, allowing for reflection on future research in the field. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"This study focuses on visual metaphors and metonymies in a Catalan teacher education context and analyses how 143 pre-service teachers use them when reflecting on the learning and teaching of writing in a blog post. The results of a thematic analysis show that pre-service teachers use visual metonymies and metaphors to help them think metacognitively about their learning experiences and become aware of their own beliefs. Visual metonymies are more frequent and are used as decorative illustrations in relation to the reflective text. In contrast, visual metaphors are less frequent but allow for deeper conceptualisation of pre-service teachers' beliefs. © 2022 The Authors"
"Objective: Scholars have conducted in-depth research on social change agents, but there are few collaborative studies in this realm between sociology and psychology. From the perspective of psychobiography, this before study uses Jung's Analytical Psychology as a theoretical framework to explore Jack Ma's influence on business change, thereby revealing the deep motivation behind Jack Ma's sudden retirement and choice to be a teacher. Method: This study has collected primary and secondary data about Jack Ma. QSR Nvivo 11.0 was used to encode the text based on video transcription, and then the data were analyzed. This study refers to the key factors of growth and follows the primary indicators of psychological saliency to sort out the data and find out what has special psychological significance, and then conducts three coding processes. Results: This study found that the teacher complex and the martial arts complex are the breakthrough points to understand the business innovator Jack Ma. Conclusion: Jack Ma shapes the image of ordinary teachers through his image management strategy, conceals his deep internal martial arts complex, and balances the displayed martial arts personality mask. He has achieved great success in business innovator, while drawing on his internal personality conflicts to his advantage. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Big social data and user-generated content have emerged as important sources of timely and rich knowledge to detect customers’ behavioral patterns. Revealing customer satisfaction through the use of user-generated content has been a significant issue in business, especially in the tourism and hospitality context. There have been many studies on customer satisfaction that take quantitative survey approaches. However, revealing customer satisfaction using big social data in the form of eWOM (electronic word of mouth) can be an effective way to better understand customers’ demands. In this study, we aim to develop a hybrid methodology based on supervised learning, text mining, and segmentation machine learning approaches to analyze big social data on travelers’ decision-making regarding hotels in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. To do so, we use support vector regression with sequential minimal optimization (SMO), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), and k-means approaches to develop the hybrid method.

"Objectives: The study aimed at describing the field of research in continuing professional development for nurse educators and the continuous education and development needs of nurse educators by asking: What research has been done in the field of continuing professional development of nurse educators? What are the continuing education and development needs and requirements reported for and by nurse educators? Design: An integrative review of peer-reviewed academic literature following a systematic search design. Data sources: Qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods publications in CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, ERIC, and PubMed. Review methods: Search results were screened for full text and assessed for quality using the Mixed Methods Assessment Tool. Full texts were then thematic analysed using an inductive and reflective process. Results: The number of published academic articles about the continuing professional development for nurse educators is small (n = 13). The themes produced from the articles identify heterogenous development needs for nurse educators, clustered around four themes: (1) professional competencies (2) management and resources, (3) communication and collaboration, and (4) agency. The findings of this review show that nurse educators have multiple roles which have specific and multiple personal and institutional needs. Conclusions: The results of this review show that the continuing professional development needs are heterogenous between nurse educators, yet share commonalities across departmental teams as a whole, and across different countries. This raises the issue of how these needs can or should be, focused on the sustainable development of nurse educators. © 2022"
"Research summary: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that examined whether providing people with a postcard, phone call, or text message reminder of their court date reduces their likelihood of failing to appear in court. We included 12 studies (N = 79,255) that compared court appearance rates between groups of people who received a reminder to groups who did not receive a reminder. Results showed that reminders significantly reduce the odds of failure to appear in court. Further, charge type moderated reminder effectiveness; court reminders had a slightly larger effect in studies that did not include people with felony charges. However, the difference in effect size as a function of charge type was small and reminders significantly reduced the odds of failure to appear in both studies that did and did not include people with felony charges. In contrast, there was no evidence that retaining people who could not be contacted in a reminder treatment group (versus excluding them from the study or intentionally assigning them to the nonreminded control group) moderated reminder effectiveness. Finally, a narrative synthesis of studies revealed that studies using more rigorous designs generally produced smaller effects compared to studies with less rigorous designs and that effects did not differ systematically as a function of reminder formats (e.g., postcard, phone call) or frequencies (e.g., one reminder or multiple). Policy implications: Court date reminders effectively reduce failures to appear across studies, so they are an inexpensive tool for jurisdictions seeking to implement pretrial reform efforts. However, reminders offer only a modest reduction in failures to appear because they only address failures to appear that result from missing or forgetting information. Thus, reminders are not a panacea to court nonappearance. Jurisdictions should consider other programs and interventions as well. Courts could address low-barrier nonappearances with reminders and then efficiently focus more involved resources to help more people get to court. © 2022 American Society of Criminology."
"Background: Physical inactivity is common in young adult cancer survivors (YACS), but evidence regarding effects of physical activity (PA) interventions among YACS is limited. The IMproving Physical Activity after Cancer Treatment (IMPACT) trial evaluated a theory-based mobile PA intervention on total PA minutes/week (primary) and secondary outcomes (moderate-to-vigorous PA [MVPA], light PA, steps, sedentary behaviors) at 6 months in YACS. Methods: YACS (N = 280) were randomized to an intervention group or self-help group. All participants received digital tools (activity tracker, smart scale, access to arm-specific Facebook group) and an individual video chat session. Intervention participants also received a 6-month program with behavioral lessons, adaptive goal-setting, tailored feedback, tailored text messages, and Facebook prompts. PA was assessed via accelerometry and questionnaires at baseline and 6 months. Generalized estimating equation analyses tested between-group differences in changes over time. Results: Of 280 YACS, 251 (90%) completed the 6-month accelerometry measures. Accelerometer-measured total PA minutes/week changed from 1974.26 at baseline to 2024.34 at 6 months in the intervention (mean change, 55.14 [95% CI, −40.91 to 151.19]) and from 1814.93 to 1877.68 in the self-help group (40.94 [95% CI, −62.14 to 144.02]; between-group p =.84). Increases in MVPA were +24.67 minutes/week (95% CI, 14.77–34.57) in the intervention versus +11.41 minutes/week in the self-help (95% CI, 1.44–21.38; between-group p =.07). Conclusion: Although the intervention did not result in significant differences in total PA, the increase in MVPA relative to the self-help group might be associated with important health benefits. Future research should examine moderators to identify for whom, and under what conditions, the intervention might be effective. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03569605. Plain Language Summary: Physical inactivity is common in young adult cancer survivors. However, few interventions have focused on helping young adult cancer survivors to get more physical activity. The IMproving Physical Activity after Cancer Treatment trial compared a mobile health physical activity intervention with a self-help group on total amount of physical activity at 6 months in a nationwide sample of young adult cancer survivors. Intervention participants did not improve their total amount of physical activity, but they did increase their moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity by twice as much as the self-help participants. This increase in activity may be associated with health benefits. © 2022 American Cancer Society."
"A novel sLC-LCC resonant dc-dc converter is proposed in this article. With the combination of a notch filter and a new sLC excitation structure of the transformer, wide and fast gain characteristics are obtained. With the frequency modulation, the notch filter structure helps the converter realize a wide output voltage range adjustable from zero theoretically. Besides, the fast voltage gain regulation capacity is achieved in a narrow frequency range with the sLC excitation structure. In the text, topology structure, operation principle, and characteristics analysis are illustrated in detail. For numerous passive components, an effective design method is necessary to guide parameter determination. And a detailed parameter design process is discussed. With the selected parameters, the soft-switching feature is realized. Finally, a 500 W experimental prototype is fabricated to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of theoretical analysis. The converter achieves 59.3-16.3 V output voltage regulation ability in a narrow frequency range (86 kHz, 189 kHz) under the condition of power 500 W and input voltage 375 V. High efficiency is maintained in the full load range, and the maximal efficiency of the converter reaches 97.7% at 99.5 kHz.  © 1986-2012 IEEE."
"Children with dyslexia need specific instructions for spelling and word analysis from an early age. It is important to provide appropriate tools using technology for writing aids to such children that can help them to input text, while providing multiple feedback. However, it is unclear how children with dyslexia can efficiently use a gaze-based virtual keyboard (VK). In this study, we propose to use the typing performance of a multimodal Hindi language eye-gaze-assisted learning system based on a VK to help in the reduction of tracking errors for people with writing and reading deficiencies and to detect children with dyslexia. Performance was assessed at three levels: eye tracker, eye tracker with soft switch, and touchscreen as a baseline modality using a predefined copy-typing task. The system was validated through a series of experiments with 32 children (16 dyslexic and 16 control). The results show that the workload and the usability of the system are substantially different for children with dyslexia. Children with dyslexia have a lower typing performance when using the touchscreen modality or the eye tracker only. The detection of children with dyslexia from others was assessed with seven different types of classifiers using the typing speed on different words (AUC > 0.9). These results highlight the need to have fully inclusive VKs. This work demonstrates the superior use of a multimodal system with participants having unique neuropsychological conditions and that the proposed system can be used to detect children with dyslexia. © 2013 IEEE."

"Background: The increased use of the copy and paste function (CPF) in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has raised concerns about possible clinician miscommunication and adverse patient outcomes. Objective: This study investigated the prevalence and extent of CPF in the EHRs of patients diagnosed with Hospital-acquired Conditions (HACs). We also examined the association between the use of CPF and patient characteristics. Materials and Methods: The prevalence and extent of CPF were investigated using electronic clinical notes of 50 patients hospitalized with HACs between 2017 and 2021 at a large academic medical center. Study patients were adults aged 21 and older with a length of stay greater than three days. ANOVA analysis was used to examine the differences in CPF use between patients with different characteristics. Results: A total of 7,844 clinical notes across seven note types are compared in the study. The mean patient age was 63.7, with an average length of stay of 15.6 days. 54% of Discharge Summaries, 53% of Consults, and 47% of history and physical (H&P) notes had duplications with the same type of notes. In the Discharge Summary, ED notes, and Plan of Care, duplications accounted for 40% or higher of the full text. H&P and Consults, H&P and Discharge Summary, and Discharge Summary and Consults were more likely to have duplications than between other types of notes. Duplications accounted for 15.5% of the information provided in H&P and Consults. The prevalence of CPF was higher in the Discharge Summary of patients who were younger, female, and had longer hospital stays. Conclusion: Both prevalence and extent of duplication were high in the Discharge Summary, Consults, and H&P notes of patients with HACs. Future studies are needed to examine the intention and appropriateness of CPF use and its impact on patient outcomes. © 2022"
"Autobiographies frequently feature the author’s understanding of home as an anchoring ground for the creation of the self. While home in such texts often invokes childhood and family, in the context of Jewish life in twentieth-century Eastern Europe, home became a complex site with a double function. Because the German authorities targeted Jewish material culture early in World War II, the destruction of communal buildings and family dwellings was unavoidable; for many, it was the first encounter with what would become the Nazi project to murder the Jews of Europe. We argue that home in Jewish wartime autobiographical texts is made to signify both a nostalgic longing for the place and objects that represent intimacy, shelter, and belonging, and at the same time, a marker of profound losses. We trace this double meaning of home by analyzing a range of Polish-Jewish ego-documents from the 1940s. Through this analysis, we show that home’s double function allowed the authors to inhabit (textually) a place of memory, asserting a claim to a prewar life with its own specific material culture, while also depicting a haunted emptiness that stands in for other losses that the writer cannot represent through language. To develop this elaboration of home’s function in the texts, we draw on and expand the concept of domicide, which identifies the loss of home as a specific type of violence. We conclude that the impact of anti-Jewish violence on the self is expressed through memory and uncanny hauntings of material culture. © 2022 SAGE Publications."
"Introduction: Acquired brain injury (ABI) is a leading cause of disability among children. An increasing number of programs have emerged to involve family members as an integral component of post-ABI rehabilitation. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of such programs among children with ABI. Methods: Following PRISMA guidelines, search among six databases (PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL) was conducted, followed by abstract/full-text screening and data extraction. Hedge's g was computed for effect sizes. The risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane guidelines. Meta-regression analyses were conducted on six moderators. Results: A total of 32 studies (reported in 37 articles) were included in the qualitative analysis. Meta-analysis of 20 studies showed a positive small-to-medium effect of family-oriented interventions on child and parental outcomes but not on family functioning. Study design moderated the effect sizes of parent outcomes. Conclusions: This study synthesized the latest empirical evidence of family-oriented rehabilitation programs for pediatric ABI across interventional strategies, study designs, and outcomes. The findings suggested an overall beneficial impact of such programs on both the pediatric patients and their caregivers. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"LNG terminals are important transfer stations for LNG storage, processing, and outbound transmission which involve intensive manual operation and safety management activities. Traditional safety evaluation methods can provide “cause-effect” information when investigating the traceability of incorrect manual operation. However, manual analysis and summarizing risk factor causality is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and there are inaccuracy problems. Usually, HAZOP meetings require safety, electrical, mechanical, instrumentation and other engineers to brainstorm and summarize the risk factors of LNG receiving terminals. This process is laborious and time-consuming, and there is no guarantee that the person will be able to record it completely every time. In this paper, a graph attention network (GAT) and bidirectional Long and Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) deep integrated learning model is proposed. The model can automatically extract risk factor causal relationships. After starting with a risk factor text, the number type features and syntactic dependency graph features of the input text are fused to enhance the causal relationship traceability of incorrect personnel operation. Taking the unloading and storage processes as examples, in terms of the effect of automatic extraction risk factors, the integrated algorithm model improves the extraction accuracy by up to 7.1% compared with a single algorithm. In addition, the correct extraction rate of different cause-effect relationships increases by 21.57%, while the integrated algorithm considers sentence matching, improves the granularity of cause-effect information based on the traditional method, expands the root cause of risk factors, and the traceability results are consistent with on-site accident event results. At the same time, it is more conducive to accurately managing incorrect manual operations. In the model training sample size sensitivity analysis, the algorithm has a superior correct causal label extraction rate for different sample sizes when the number of hidden layer stacking layers is K= 2, which solves the problem of model adaptation for the text volume of LNG terminal risk factors. © 2022 The Institution of Chemical Engineers"
"In the process of developing a business, aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) could help extract customers' opinions on different aspects of the business from online reviews. Researchers have found great prospective in deep learning approaches to solving ABSA tasks. Furthermore, studies have also explored the implementation of text augmentation, such as Easy Data Augmentation (EDA), to improve the deep learning models’ performance using only simple operations. However, when implementing EDA to ABSA, there will be high chances that the augmented sentences could lose important aspects or sentiment-related words (target words) critical for training. Corresponding to that, another study has made adjustments to EDA for English aspect-based sentiment data provided with the target words tag. However, the solution still needs additional modifications in the case of non-tagged data. Hence, in this work, we will focus on modifying EDA that integrates POS tagging and word similarity to not only understand the context of the words but also extract the target words directly from non-tagged sentences. Additionally, the modified EDA is combined with the backtranslation method, as the latter has also shown quite a significant contribution to the model’s performance in several research studies. The proposed method is then evaluated on a small Indonesian ABSA dataset using baseline deep learning models. Results show that the augmentation method could increase the model’s performance on a limited dataset problem. In general, the best performance for aspect classification is achieved by implementing the proposed method, which increases the macro-accuracy and F1, respectively, on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM models compared to the original EDA. The proposed method also obtained the best performance for sentiment classification using a convolutional neural network, increasing the overall accuracy by 2.2% and F1 by 3.2%. © 2023 by the authors."
"The present study compares the influence of text-based recommendations; traditionally known as online consumer reviews, and the influence of voice-based recommendations provided by voice-driven virtual assistants on consumer behaviors. Based on media richness theory, the research model investigates how voice versus text modality influences consumers' perceptions of credibility and usefulness, as well as their behavioral intentions and actual behaviors. In addition, the study analyses if these relationships vary based on the type of product and compares the influence of masculine and feminine voices. Two studies were conducted using between-subjects experimental designs, partial least squares-structural equation modeling, and logistic regression. The core finding is that voice-based recommendations are more effective than online consumer reviews in altering consumer behaviors. In addition, the first study showed that the influence of recommendations on behavioral intentions is mediated by consumers' perceptions of their credibility and usefulness. The second study confirmed, in a realistic setting, that voice-based recommendations affect consumer choices to a greater extent. Recommendations for search products and provided by males are also found to be more effective. These results contribute to the voice assistant and e-WOM literature by highlighting the effectiveness of voice-based recommendations in predicting consumer behaviors, confirming that credibility and usefulness are key factors that determine the influence of recommendations, and showing that recommendations are more effective when they focus on search products. © 2022 The Authors.

"We investigate how the stringency of government anti-pandemic policy measures might affect economic policy uncertainty in countries with different degrees of press freedom, various press reporting styles and writing conventions. We apply a text-based measure of uncertainty using data from over 400,000 press articles from Belarus, Kazakhstan, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, the UK and the USA published before the wide-scale vaccination programmes were introduced. The measure accounts for pandemic-related words and negative sentiment scores weight the selected articles. We then tested the dynamic panel data model where the relative changes in these measures were explained by levels and changes in the stringency measures. We have found that introducing and then maintaining unchanged for a relatively long time a constant level of anti-pandemic stringency measures reduce uncertainty. In contrast, a change in such a level has the opposite effect. This result is robust across the countries, despite their differences in political systems, press control and freedom of speech. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Background: Rotator cuff disease is a common cause of shoulder pain. Comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia may be associated with rotator cuff disease, likely because of mechanisms related to vascular insufficiency. Objectives: We performed a systematic review of the association of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia with the diagnosis of rotator cuff disease. Methods: Following systematic queries of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CINAHL, and Science Direct, articles meeting eligibility criteria and reporting on the association of one or more risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia) and rotator cuff disease were considered. Meta-analysis was performed to quantitatively summarize the associations between each risk factor and rotator cuff disease. We assessed study quality with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and performed a qualitative assessment of risk of bias. Results: After a full-text review of 212 articles, 12 articles assessing diabetes, 5 assessing hypertension and 8 assessing hyperlipidemia were eligible. The odds of having rotator cuff disease was increased with diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43–1.55), hypertension (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.19–1.65) and hyperlipidemia/dyslipidemia (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.42–1.55). Diabetes was also specifically associated with rotator cuff tears (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07–1.52). Synthesizing assessment for risk of bias suggested that current epidemiologic evidence for an association was plausible for diabetes and hyperlipidemia but not hypertension. Conclusions: Diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia were associated with rotator cuff disease in our meta-analysis. However, the possibility of bias exists for all 3 co-morbidities evaluated and is likely highest for hypertension. High-quality studies with the ability to incorporate time since first diagnosis of co-morbidity are scarce and much needed. © 2022 Elsevier Masson SAS"
"Background: Males represent less than 10 % of the global nursing workforce. To increase the recruitment and representation of male nurses, their experiences in prelicensure nursing education must be understood. Objectives: The purpose of this integrative review was to explore literature related to male nursing students' experiences during prelicensure education. Design: An integrative review of the literature was conducted using Whittemore and Knafl's methodology. Data sources: Database searches of CINAHL, PubMed, ERIC, Emcare, and Scopus were conducted. Review methods: Database searches identified 237 articles for initial review. Titles, abstracts, and full-text articles were screened for relevance. Quality appraisal was evaluated using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool Version 2018. Data analysis was conducted using Conventional Content Analysis. Results: Twenty-two articles (19 qualitative, two quantitative, and one mixed-methods) were included in this review. The existing literature suggests that male nursing students have generally negative experiences during their prelicensure education due to external reactions from family, friends, peers, and healthcare providers to their choice of nursing as a profession; lack of male role models; extensive assistance with physical tasks in the clinical setting; exclusion in obstetrics clinical experiences; and female-gendered descriptions of nurses within the educational environment. Fostering new relationships was identified as a positive experience during prelicensure education. Conclusions: Generally, male nursing students have negative experiences during their prelicensure education, with limited positive experiences. As such, nurse educators should implement strategies, such as avoiding gendered references when referring to the nurse, offering male mentorship when possible, and providing comparable clinical assignments to students regardless of gender, to improve male nursing students' experiences in prelicensure education and, consequently, increase the recruitment and retention of men into the nursing profession. Future research is needed to more comprehensively understand male nursing students' experiences during prelicensure education and the impact of teaching strategies on their experiences. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Introduction: Exploitation of telehealth in prenatal care has the potential to reduce the access barrier to care and empower women to participate in their own care. This review aims to assess the practical implications of virtual prenatal care and identify the needs and experiences associated with it. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in four electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane. The keywords used were “pregnancy”, “virtual visit”, “prenatal”, and others. The search included all relevant studies published from 2011 to 2021 written in English. Articles mentioning virtual prenatal care incorporating synchronous communication between pregnant women and health care professionals were included. Those unrelated to prenatal care or employing asynchronous means of virtual care were excluded. The review was structured following the PRISMA guidelines. Different quality appraisal methods such as JBI, CASP, NOS, and Cochrane were used to assess the methodological quality of the literature. The data were then analyzed based on the categorization of the studies. Results: Overall, 2863 articles were identified, of which 19 met the inclusion criteria after removing duplicates, screening of abstracts, and full text—four articles identified from hand-searching were incorporated, making a total of 23 eligible articles for the review. The studies' findings revealed the preference for implementing cost-effective virtual care based on the resource set, technological literacy, and consistent accessibility. Further, no significant differences in clinical outcomes were observed between two modes of care, virtual and in-person. The higher satisfaction by pregnant women and healthcare professionals indicated the continuity of the care. In addition, the hybrid model of virtual prenatal care integrated with traditional in-person care was acceptable to both low-risk and high-risk pregnant women. Virtual prenatal care substantially reduced travel time and absences from work, drops in clinic wait time and no-show rate, limited the risk of exposure during a pandemic, and increased self-accountability. Conclusion: Virtual prenatal care offers predominant advantages over in-person when it is carefully designed with the inclusion of pregnant women and healthcare professionals' needs. Evidence showed that providing adequate technology training, proper instruction, and guidelines for initial setup and assurance of a reliable and accessible system is vital in increasing access to care. © 2022 The Authors"
"Erratum to: “β-Amyloid Precursor Protein Intracellular Domain Controls Mitochondrial Function by Modulating Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog–Induced Kinase 1 Transcription in Cells and in Alzheimer Mice Models,” by Goiran et al. (Biol Psychiatry 2018; 83:416–427); https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2017.04.011. The authors have recognized an inadvertent error in Figure 7. Specifically, the authors failed to acknowledge in the legend for Figure 7 that the image for the control condition (CT) in panel (A) is the same as the control condition (AAV-empty) in Figure 6B from their 2016 Acta Neuropathologica paper (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00401-016-1577-6), which was cited as reference 27. During the course of characterizing AAV-C99 and AAV-AICD-expressing mice, a confocal analysis was performed in June 2016. As a control, mice were infected with empty AAV on the same day and in strictly the same conditions (same virus titers, same site of injection) and referred to as AAV-empty in the 2016 paper and control in the 2018 paper. The labeling was performed the same day for AAV-empty, AAV-C99, and AAV-AICD with the same antibody APPCt (1/1000), which labels not only overexpressed APP-CTF and AICD but also endogenous APP. In these control conditions, the endogenous APP labeling is very weak, virtually undetectable, explaining why most of the images were taken from AAV-C99 and AAV-AICD-expressing mice. The images provided in the 2018 paper were intended to illustrate the previously and extensively demonstrated nuclear localization of AICD in a qualitative manner and not to quantify the protein level of AICD that has been done by a more quantitative approach (Western blot). Images were recorded with exactly the same acquisition parameters (same zoom, same objectives, same laser intensity). All the strictly similar experimental procedures have been extensively described in both papers in either the main body of the article or supplementary materials. Thus, the AAV-empty control image (middle lower panel in Figure 6B in Acta Neuropathologica) and the CT panel (upper left in Figure 7A in Biological Psychiatry) are effectively identical as they are the same control performed during this initial parallel characterization of AAV-C99 and AAV-AICD mice. Thus, the image provided in the 2018 Biological Psychiatry paper is scientifically sound and rigorously adequate, but because there was an almost 2-year interval in publishing the characterization of the C99 and AICD mice, the authors illustrated these common controls by inadvertently using the same image and without attribution. The authors apologize for this oversight. In sum, the control condition (CT) in Figure 7A of the Biological Psychiatry paper is identical to the control condition (AAV-empty) shown in Figure 6B in the Acta Neuropathologica paper, but the authors emphasize that the panel in question remains a basic illustration of the widely reported in the literature on AICD nuclear localization. The legend text of Figure 7 has been updated to indicate that this panel was previously published in reference 27. © 2022 Society of Biological Psychiatry"
"Online medical platform is a platform for patients to post their medical experience, collect medical information, and link doctors and patients for related medical activities. As the number of patients and doctors registered on the platform increases, there is an urgent need to consider how patients can identify useful information from the vast amount of information to help them make medical choices, and how the platform can provide distinctive medical choices based on the risk preferences of patients. In this paper, we propose a decision-making model that integrates a machine-learning method and a multi-criteria decision-making method to help patients to select physicians based on user-generated content considering interactive criteria and risk preferences of patients. Firstly, by data mining methods, various criteria included in user-generated content that influence patients' selection behavior are retrieved to construct a physician evaluation system. Secondly, a sentiment analysis method based on a medical review corpus is developed to mine satisfaction information from text reviews. Finally, a multi-criteria decision-making method is proposed considering patients' risk-averse preferences for medical services and the interactions among criteria. The validity of the proposed model is demonstrated by a case study of ranking psychologists from haodf.com. The comparisons with other methods and sensitivity analysis results provide suggestions to patients to choose psychologists and the website to rank psychologists. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"We assessed adherence to five transparency practices—data sharing, code sharing, conflict of interest disclosure, funding disclosure, and protocol registration—in articles in dental journals. We searched and exported the full text of all research articles from PubMed-indexed dental journals available in the Europe PubMed Central database until the end of 2021. We programmatically assessed their adherence to the five transparency practices using a validated and automated tool. Journal- and article-related information was retrieved from ScimagoJR and Journal Citation Reports. Of all 329,784 articles published in PubMed-indexed dental journals, 10,659 (3.2%) were available to download. Of those, 77% included a conflict of interest disclosure, and 62% included a funding disclosure. Seven percent of the articles had a registered protocol. Data sharing (2.0%) and code sharing (0.1%) were rarer. Sixteen percent of articles did not adhere to any of the five transparency practices, 29% adhered to one, 48% adhered to two, 7.0% adhered to three, 0.3% adhered to four, and no article adhered to all five practices. Adherence to transparency practices increased over time; however, data and code sharing especially remained rare. Coordinated efforts involving all stakeholders are needed to change current transparency practices in dental research. © 2022 The Authors.

"Context: Privacy policies document the privacy requirements guiding developers. Though privacy policies analysis has drawn increasing attention recently, how end users perceive privacy requirements has been less explored. Objective: We empirically explore the privacy requirements gap between developers and end users to derive beneficial insights into users’ privacy concerns to support maintenance. Method: We present a semi-automatic privacy requirements gap analysis framework based on text mining including information retrieval, topic modeling, and computational linguistic techniques. Results: The preliminary results of applying our framework to Facebook show that: (1) topic comparison reveals that both privacy related reviews and policy statements involve privacy requirements types of collection, usage, and disclosure as well as account security. The retention requirements are almost not mentioned in reviews as they are hard to be directly perceived; (2) content comparisons reveal that though overlapping with the privacy policy statements, reviews are more general, informal, and negative in wording. Conclusion: The illustrative example with Facebook demonstrates the potential usage of our framework in informing software maintenance, e.g., privacy relevant testing and privacy policy refinement. © 2022"
"In Table 1, we noted that some RGI areas were wrongly reported from the RGI 6.0 documentation. The ice area of “N. Asia” should be 2 × 103 km2 (not 3 × 103 km2) and “Asia” should be 98 × 103 km2 (and not 118 × 103 km2, as initially reported). Consequently, the total ice area is 706 × 102 km2 (not 727 × 102 km2). Another typographical error was noted for the ice volume of Asia, which should be 9.4 ± 3.7 103 km3 instead of 9.6 ± 3.7 103 km3. We also noted some rounding inconsistencies for Region 11, where the sea-level equivalent (SLE) should be 0.29 ± 0.1 mm (as correctly used in Supplementary Table 1) and not 0.30 ± 0.1 mm. Similarly, the SLE of RGI-5 should be 26.9 ± 9.5 mm instead of 26.8 ± 9.5 mm, and the one of RGI-16 should be 0.18 ± 0.1 mm instead of 0.16 ± 0.1. For RGI-12, the volume should be 0.05 ± 0.03 103 km3 instead of 0.06 ± 0.03 103 km3 (note that the SLE remains correct). For RGI-10, the volume should be 0.11 ± 0.03 103 km3 instead of 0.09 ± 0.03 103 km3. Corresponding SLE, and regional differences were corrected accordingly and we provide online a version of Table 1 showing these corrections. Note that these changes remain within initial error margins and have no impact on the conclusions and analysis of the paper. The main text has been updated to reflect these changes. In the text now reading, “Using the new constraint provided by the surface velocity, the global volume of ice within the RGI is estimated at (140.6 ± 40.4)…,” “140.6” replaces “140.8” while in the text now reading “By comparison, the ice volume in the high mountains of Asia is (9.4 ± 3.7)x103 km3 or 7% of the global estimate”, “9.4” replaces “9.6”. Note that the percentage is unchanged. Further, in the text now reading “While our estimates are generally lower, we find in Asia an ice volume 34% larger than that in ref. 9 but only 3% larger than that in ref. 7,” “34%” replaces “37%,” while “3%” replaces “5%”. In the abstract, for the text now reading “At low latitudes, our findings highlight notable changes in freshwater resources, with 34% more ice in the Himalayas,” “34%” replaces 37%”. Finally, to avoid misinterpretation, the sentence in the abstract now reading “After reallocating volume connected to the Antarctic ice sheet, the results suggest that the world’s glaciers have a potential contribution to sea-level rise of 257 ± 85 mm, which is 20% less than previously estimated” has been updated from “The results suggest that the world’s glaciers have a potential contribution to sea-level rise of 257 ± 85 mm, which is 20% less than previously estimated.” We have also corrected Supplementary Table 1 accordingly (see revised Supplementary information in the original article). We wanted to bring some clarifications on the caption of Supplementary Table 1, and the differences between the column “Farinotti 2019”1, which was calculated using Supplementary Table 2 from their study, and “Consensus 2019”, which was calculated by converting their volume estimates (Table 1 from their study) into sea-level equivalent using the same ice density that was used in our study (i.e., 0.9167 Gt/km3)2. Hence, we provide a clarified caption of Supplementary Table 1 accompanying the original article. We would like to acknowledge Fabien Maussion at the University of Innsbruck and Regine Hock at the University of Oslo for carefully notifying us about these inconsistencies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited 2022."
"Introduction: Timely colorectal cancer (CRC) screening has been shown to improve CRC-related morbidity and mortality rates. However, even with this preventative care tool, CRC screening rates remain below 70% among eligible United States (US) adults, with even lower rates among US immigrants. The aim of this scoping review is to describe the barriers to CRC screening faced by this unique and growing immigrant population and discuss possible interventions to improve screening. Methods: Four electronic databases were systematically searched for all original research articles related to CRC screening in US immigrants published after 2010. Following a full-text review of articles for inclusion in the final analysis, data extraction was conducted while coding descriptive themes. Thematic analysis led to the organization of this data into five themes. Results: Of the 4637 articles initially identified, 55 met inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis of the barriers to CRC screening identified five unique themes: access, knowledge, culture, trust, health perception, and beliefs. The most cited barriers were in access (financial burden and limited primary care access) and knowledge (CRC/screening knowledge). Conclusions: US immigrants face several barriers to the receipt of CRC screening. When designing interventions to increase screening uptake among immigrants, gaps in physician and screening education, access to care, and trust need to be addressed through culturally sensitive supports. These interventions should be tailored to the specific immigrant group, since a one-size-fits approach fails to consider the heterogeneity within this population. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Mobile apps are becoming an integral part of people's daily life by providing various functionalities, such as messaging and gaming. App developers try their best to ensure user experience during app development and maintenance to improve the rating of their apps on app platforms and attract more user downloads. Previous studies indicated that responding to users' reviews tends to change their attitude towards the apps positively. Users who have been replied are more likely to update the given ratings. However, reading and responding to every user review is not an easy task for developers since it is common for popular apps to receive tons of reviews every day. Thus, automation tools for review replying are needed. To address the need above, the paper introduces a Transformer-based approach, named TRRGen, to automatically generate responses to given user reviews. TRRGen extracts apps' categories, rating, and review text as the input features. By adapting a Transformer-based model, TRRGen can generate appropriate replies for new reviews. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on the real-world datasets indicate that the proposed approach can generate high-quality replies for users' reviews and significantly outperform current state-of-art approaches on the task. The manual validation results on the generated replies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Background: Microscopic unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression (ULBD) is a minimally invasive technique used in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis and could limit spinal instability and be associated with better clinical outcomes. However, there is ongoing debate regarding its utility compared to conventional laminectomy (CL). The primary objective was to collate and describe the current evidence base for ULBD, including perioperative parameters, functional outcomes, and complications. The secondary objective was to identify operative techniques. Methods: A scoping review was conducted between January 1990 and August 2022 according to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Major databases were searched for full text English articles reporting on outcomes following microscopic unilateral laminotomy in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. Results: Seventeen articles met the inclusion criteria. Two studies were randomised controlled trials. Two studies were prospective data collection and the rest were retrospective analysis. Three studies compared ULBD with CL. ULBD preserves the osteoligamentous complex and may be associated with shorter operative time, less blood loss, and similar clinical outcomes when compared to CL. Conclusion: This review highlights that ULBD aims to minimise disruption to the normal posterior spinal anatomy and may have acceptable clinical outcomes. It also highlights that it is difficult to draw valid conclusions given there are limited data available as most studies identified were retrospective or did not have a comparator group. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Given a text T and a pattern P, the order-preserving pattern matching (OPPM for short) problem is to find all substrings of T which have the same relative orders as P. Recently, approximate OPPM that allows errors have been studied such as OPPM with k-mismatches. In this paper we define the OPPM with scaling which is a novel criteria for approximate OPPM by considering the relative orders of cusps and the scale of lengths of strings between them. Also we present an algorithm to solve the OPPM problem with scaling in O(n+mlog⁡m) time, which is the same time bound as the best known exact OPPM algorithm. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Automatic extraction of relations between gene mutations and cancer entities occurring in the cancer literature using text mining can rapidly provide vital information to support precision cancer medicine. However, mutation-cancer relation extraction is more challenging than general relation extraction from free text, since it is often not possible without cancer-specific background knowledge and thus the model replies on a deeper understanding of complex surrounding tokens. We propose a deep learning model that jointly extracts mutations and their associated cancers. Background knowledge comes from two different knowledge bases which store different types of information about mutations. Given the different ways in which knowledge is stored in these two resources, we propose two separate methods for embedding knowledge, namely sentence-based knowledge integration and attribute-aware knowledge integration. The evaluation demonstrated that our model outperforms a number of baseline models and gains 96.00%, 92.57% and 94.57% F1 scores on three public datasets, EMU BCa, EMU PCa, and BRONCO, thus illustrating the effectiveness of our knowledge integration approach. The auxiliary experiments show that our models can utilize more informative text from the KBs and link the mutations to their corresponding cancer disease although the input text provides insufficient context.  © 2022 IEEE."
"Background: Similar to clinical palpation, Ultrasound elastography (USE) helps distinguish between tissues by providing information on their elasticity. While it has been widely explored and has been applied to many body organs, USE has not been studied as extensively for application in neurosurgery. The current systematic review was performed to identify articles related to the use of interoperative USE in neurosurgery. Methods: Search included MEDLINE(R) database. Only original peer-reviewed full-text articles were included. No language or publication year restrictions were imposed. Two independent reviewers assessed the search results for relevance. The identified articles were screened by title, abstract, and full-text review. Results: Seventeen articles were included in the qualitative analysis and 13 articles were related to oncology, epilepsy (n = 3), and spine (n = 1). In oncology, USE was found useful in defining tumor stiffness, aiding surgical planning, detecting residual tumors, discriminating between tumor and brain tissue, and differentiating between different tumors. In epilepsy, USE could improve the detection of epileptogenic foci, thereby enhancing the prospect of complete and safe resection. The application in spinal surgery was limited to demonstrating that a compressed spinal cord is stiffer than the decompressed one. Conclusions: USE was found to be a safe, quick, portable, and economic tool that was a useful intraoperative adjunct to provide information corresponding to a variety of neurosurgical diseases, at different stages of surgery. This review describes the current intraoperative neurosurgical applications of USE, the concept of elasticity, and different USE modalities as well as the technical challenges, limitations, and possible future implications. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"This study analyzes a series of three discussions of C. J. Heuer's BUG: Deaf Identity and Internal Revolution (Bug) in a university service-learning course for teacher candidates (TCs). Bug provides a collection of short pieces written from a deaf perspective to convey the way the author has experienced life in the insensitive, dismissive social world of hearing people. The course was organized so that TCs explored issues of human diversity in book clubs in which they chose their own texts, discussed them inductively among themselves on their own terms, and then led their classmates in an exploration of the key issues raised in the texts. Their discussions were audiorecorded and transcribed for analysis. Using a lens provided by Vygotsky's work in defectology—a field that, in contrast to the term, draws attention to the social consequences of a human difference, rather than finding the condition itself a “defect”—we identified the themes explored in their discussions. Vygotsky argued that the “problem” of human difference concerns the re-education of people considered “normal,” rather than the remediation of a point of difference such as deafness. This study outlines how the student-generated insights from their discussions comprise a form of re-education among hearing students with little prior exposure to, or understanding of, deafness. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Context: Outcomes in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are reported inconsistently, with variability in definitions and measurement. Hence, it is difficult to compare intervention effectiveness and synthesise outcomes for systematic reviews and to create clinical practice guidelines. This uncertainty in the evidence makes it difficult to guide patient-clinician decision-making. One solution is a core outcome set (COS): an agreed minimum set of outcomes. Objective: To describe outcome reporting, definitions, and measurement heterogeneity as the first stage in co-creating a COS for localised renal cancer. Evidence acquisition: We systematically reviewed outcome reporting heterogeneity in effectiveness trials and observational studies in localised RCC. In total, 2822 studies (randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, systematic reviews) up to June 2020 meeting our inclusion criteria were identified. Abstracts and full texts were screened independently by two reviewers; in cases of disagreement, a third reviewer arbitrated. Data extractions were double-checked. Evidence synthesis: We included 149 studies and found that there was inconsistency in which outcomes were reported across studies and variability in the definitions used for outcomes that were conceptually the same. We structured our analysis using the outcome classification taxonomy proposed by Dodd et al. Outcomes linked to adverse events (eg, bleeding, outcomes linked to surgery) and renal injury outcomes (reduced renal function) were reported most commonly. Outcomes related to deaths from any cause and from cancer were reported in 44% and 25% of studies, respectively, although the time point for measurement and the analysis methods were inconsistent. Outcomes linked to life impact (eg, global quality of life) were reported least often. Clinician-reported outcomes are more frequently reported than patient-reported outcomes in the renal cancer literature. Conclusions: This systematic review underscores the heterogeneity of outcome reporting, definitions, and measurement in research on localised renal cancer. It catalogues the variety of outcomes and serves as a first step towards the development of a COS for localised renal cancer. Patient summary: We reviewed studies on localised kidney cancer and found that multiple terms and definitions have been used to describe outcomes. These are not defined consistently, and often not defined at all. Our review is the first phase in developing a core outcome set to allow better comparisons of studies to improve medical care. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"Purpose: Digestive system tumors are a group of tumors with high incidence in the world nowadays. The assessment of digestive system tumor metastasis by conventional imaging seems to be unsatisfactory. [68Ga]Ga-FAPI, which has emerged in recent years, seems to be able to evaluate digestive system tumor metastasis. We aimed to summarize the current evidence of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET/CT or PET/MR for the assessment of primary tumors, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases in digestive system tumors. Besides, we also aimed to perform a meta-analysis of the sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET diagnosis to discriminate between digestive system tumors, primary lesions, and non-primary lesions (lymph node metastases and distant metastases). Materials and methods: PubMed, MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases were searched from the beginning of the database build to August 12, 2022. All studies undergoing [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET for the evaluation of digestive tumors were included in the screening and review. Screening and full text review was performed by 3 investigators and data extraction was performed by 2 investigators. Risk of bias was examined with the QUADAS-2 criteria. Diagnostic test meta-analysis was performed with a random-effects model. Results: A total of 541 studies were retrieved. Finally, 22 studies were selected for the systematic review and 18 studies were included in the meta-analysis. In the 18 publications, a total of 524 patients with digestive system tumors, 459 primary tumor lesions of digestive system tumors, and 1921 metastatic lesions of digestive system tumors were included in the meta-analysis. Based on patients, the sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET for the diagnosis of digestive system tumors was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94–0.99). Based on lesions, the sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET for the diagnostic evaluation of primary tumor lesions of the digestive system was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.93–0.99); the sensitivity of [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET for the diagnostic evaluation of non-primary lesions (lymph node metastases and distant metastases) of the digestive system tumors was 0.94 (95% CI: 0.79–0.99). Conclusion: [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET has high accuracy and its sensitivity is at a high level for the diagnostic evaluation of digestive system tumors. Clinicians, nuclear medicine physicians, and radiologists may consider using [68Ga]Ga-FAPI PET/CT or PET/MR in the evaluation of primary tumors, lymph node metastases, and distant metastases in digestive system tumors. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Objective: To assess the quality of harms reporting in systematic reviews (SRs) regarding minimally invasive hysterectomies (MIHs). Data Sources: We performed a cross-sectional analysis on SRs addressing MIHs to assess completeness of harms reporting. Hysterectomies are common gynecologic procedures and are associated with complications. Such adverse events can directly affect physician decision making and patient outcomes. Thus, it is important that SRs equally weigh the harms and benefits surrounding MIHs. Methods of Study Selection: On May 15, 2022, we searched MEDLINE (PubMed and Ovid), Embase, Epistemonikos, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for SRs with or without a meta-analysis on MIH for any indication. Eligible studies underwent full-text screening, data extraction, harms reporting assessment, and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews-2 quality assessment in a masked, duplicate fashion. The corrected covered area was calculated to indicate any overlap between SR dyads. Tabulation, Integration, and Results: A total of 52 SRs met the inclusion criteria for data extraction. We found that >44 of included SRs (of 52; 84.6%) reported >50% of the harms items. Completeness of harms reporting was significantly associated with harms specification as a primary outcome (p <.05). The corrected covered area was 0.60%. Conclusion: The harms reporting was more complete than hypothesized, but still had deficiencies throughout, such as inconsistent use of severity scales to classify harms. Even though MIH harms reporting in sample SRs was more complete than other fields of medicine, it was still suboptimal overall and requires refinement. © 2022 AAGL"
"Women are underrepresented in cardiac rehabilitation (CR) despite the benefits, and this is exacerbated in lower-resource settings where CR is insufficiently available. In this randomized controlled trial, the effectiveness of the Technology-based Comprehensive Cardiac Rehabilitation Therapy (TaCT) electronic cardiac rehabilitation (eCR) intervention on functional capacity, risk factors, quality of life, heart-health behaviors, symptoms, and morbidity will be tested among women with CVD in a middle-income country. Following a pilot study, a single-center, single-blinded, 2 parallel-arm (1:1 SNOSE) superiority trial comparing an eCR intervention (TaCT) to usual care, with assessments pre-intervention and at 3 and 6 months will be undertaken. One hundred adult women will be recruited. Permuted block (size 10) randomization will be applied. The 6-month intervention comprises an app, website, SMS texts with generic heart-health management advice, and bi-weekly 1:1 telephone calls with a nurse trainee. Individualized exercise prescriptions will be developed based on an Incremental Shuttle Walk Test (primary outcome) and dietary plans based on 24 h dietary recall. A yoga/relaxation video will be provided via WhatsApp, along with tobacco cessation support and a moderated group chat. At 3 months, intervention engagement and acceptability will be assessed. Analyses will be conducted based on intent-to-treat. If results of this novel trial of women-focused eCR in a middle-income country demonstrate clinically-significant increases in functional capacity, this could represent an important development for the field considering this would be an important outcome for women and would translate to lower mortality. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Chronic wounds adversely affect the quality of life of individuals and odour is a well-recognised associated factor. Odour can affect sleep, well-being, social interactions, diet and potentially wound healing. This systematic review aims to examine the effectiveness of topical interventions in the management of odour associated with chronic and malignant fungating wounds. A systematic review guided by PRISMA recommendations of randomised controlled trials where odour intensity/odour is the primary outcome was undertaken. Inclusion criteria were adults (18 years and over) with chronic venous, arterial, diabetic or pressure ulcers or with malignant fungating wounds where odour has been managed through topical application of pharmacological/non-pharmacological agents. Searches were conducted in CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science. Eligibility screening, risk of bias assessment and data extraction was completed by authors working independently. Searches retrieved 171 titles and abstracts (157 post de-duplication). Thirteen studies were retained for full text review of which five (n = 137 individuals) examining the following treatments remained: metronidazole (n = 4), silver (n = 1). Meta-analysis was not possible but individual studies suggest improved outcomes (i.e., reduced odour) using metronidazole. Treatment options to manage wound odour are limited and hampered by lack of clinical trials, small sample sizes, and absence of standardised outcomes and consistent measurement. Whereas metronidazole and silver may have a role in controlling wound odour, robust and well-designed interventions with rigorous procedures and standardised odour outcomes are necessary to evaluate their contribution. © 2022"
"Background: The devastating effects of COVID-19 sparked debates among professionals in the fields of health, law, and bioethics regarding policies on mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers. Suboptimal vaccine uptake among healthcare workers had been implicated in the increased risk of nosocomial spread of COVID infection and absenteeism among healthcare workers, impacting the quality of patient care. However, mandatory vaccine policies were also seen to encroach on the autonomy of healthcare workers. Aims and objectives: To synthesise the arguments for and against mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers (HCWs) and its long-term impact on the healthcare workforce, through an analysis of texts and opinions of professionals from different fields of study. Methods: This is a systematic review of opinions published in peer-reviewed journals. After initial search in Cochrane and JBI systematic review databases to ensure no previous review had been done, five databases were searched (PsychInfo, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Medline and Scopus). Inclusion criteria were: 1) focused on COVID-19; 2) healthcare workers specific; 3) specific to mandatory vaccination; 4) opinion piece with an identified author; and 5) in English. Exclusion: 1) focus on other vaccine preventable diseases, not COVID-19 and 2) discussion on mandatory vaccination not-specific to healthcare workers. The Joanna Briggs Critical Appraisal tool for Text and Opinions was used to assess quality. Data were synthesised in the summary table. Results: The review included 28 opinion and viewpoint articles. Of these, 12 (43 %) adopted a pro-mandatory vaccination stance, 13 (46 %) were neutral or had presented arguments from both sides of the debate and only three (11 %) were against. The overall arguments among those who were pro-, neutral and anti-mandatory COVID-19 vaccination were underpinned by ethical, moral and legal principles of such a mandate on a vulnerable healthcare workforce. This review highlighted the polarised opinions concerning choices, human rights, professional responsibilities and personal risks (i.e. health risks, losing a job) with the introduction of vaccination mandate. However, the articles found in this review discussed mandatory vaccination of healthcare workers in the USA, Europe and Australia only. Conclusion: The review underscores the need to balance the rights of the public to safe and quality care with the rights and moral obligations of healthcare workers during a public health emergency. This can be achieved when policies and mandates are guided by reliable scientific evidence which are flexible in considering legal and ethical dilemmas.

"Geological maps contain rich geological knowledge, such as faults, structures, minerals, etc. Automatically and accurately recognition of geological symbols is the basis step for understanding geological maps and constructing geological knowledge connections between maps and texts. Due to the diverse combinations of symbols, complex background and color noise interference, symbol subscripts in geological maps directly affect the accurate recognition of geological symbols. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a three-stages of the framework based on deep learning to recognize symbols in geological maps. The framework contains dataset automatic construction, convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) model training, and geo-symbol index construction. First, we propose a method to generate a base character-based training dataset that can generate geological map legend datasets of arbitrary length and different color backgrounds; second, we train a variable-length image text recognition optical character recognition (OCR) model CRNN and conduct comparative experiments to verify the effectiveness of our proposed recognition framework. Finally, the stage of geo-symbol index construction establishes the corresponding index list of geological symbols and corresponding descriptions for converting the recognized geological symbols into corresponding names and finally output the result. We performed experimental validation and analysis on our automatically generated dataset. The experimental results show that the accuracy of our algorithm recognition reaches 94%, which verifies the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. © 2022 The Authors"
"Introduction: New warning labels for alcohol could reduce alcohol-related health harms. This study examined consumer responses to alcohol warnings with different designs. Methods: A national sample of 3,051 U.S. adults completed an online survey in August 2021. Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 warning topics (addiction, liver damage, early death, or colon cancer). Participants viewed 3 labels presented in random order: 2 types of warning labels (text-only and icon) showing a newly developed warning message about their assigned topic and a text-only control label showing a neutral message. Participants rated each label on effectiveness at discouraging alcohol consumption (primary outcome) and attention (secondary outcome) using 1-to-5‒point Likert-type scales. Participants also rated warnings with different causal language variants (e.g., “increases the risk of”, “contributes to”) and marker words (e.g., “WARNING”, “SURGEON GENERAL WARNING”). Results: Both the text-only and icon warnings were perceived as more effective (average differential effects=0.79 and 0.86, respectively) and more attention grabbing (average differential effects=0.43 and 0.69, respectively) than control labels (all p<0.001). The icon warnings were rated as more effective and attention grabbing than the text-only warnings (average differential effects=0.07 and 0.27, respectively, both p<0.001). Although all warning topics outperformed the control messages, warnings about addiction were rated as less effective and attention grabbing than warnings about the other topics. A majority (60%) of participants selected “increases the risk of” as the most discouraging causal variant, and a plurality (47%) selected “SURGEON GENERAL WARNING” as the most discouraging marker word. Conclusions: New alcohol warnings could discourage alcohol consumption, especially if warnings include icons. © 2022 American Journal of Preventive Medicine"
"Objectives: This study aimed to identify the knowledge structure of medication safety nursing education literature by developing schematic diagrams of the relationship between keywords from a macro perspective. This study also identifies the research topics and trends over time. Design: This quantitative content study used text network analysis to explore keywords and research topics using topic modeling within the medication safety nursing education literature. Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were used to search for the medication safety nursing education literature published until December 2021. Methods: Keywords from 2085 articles were examined using text network analysis and topic modeling with NetMiner 4.4.3. Results: The keywords with the most frequency and the highest networking degree in centrality were “patient,” “medication,” “program,” “nurse,” and “care.” The emerging keywords assessed by time periods were identified; the first phase (“heart failure,” “insulin,” “chemotherapy,” and “infusion”), the second phase (“medication errors,” “staff,” and “information”), the third phase (“program,” “management,” and “data”). The results of topic modeling were as follows: safe medication administration, safe medication reconciliation process, medication education for patients, medication errors in nursing practice, and multidisciplinary teamwork for medication safety. Conclusion: These findings will help nursing researchers and educators to understand the trends and insights for medication safety education and educate future nurses to provide safer nursing care. © 2022 The Authors"
"Aims: This studys aim is to test the effectiveness of five interventions each utilizing a unique set of behavior change techniques on reducing alcohol consumption at 3 and 6 months among young adults with hazardous drinking. Design, setting and participants: This study used a five-arm parallel randomized controlled trial with 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Recruitment occurred at four emergency departments in Pittsburgh, PA, USA. Participants were non-treatment-seeking young adults (mean age = 22.1 years; 68.5% female; 37.1% black) who reported hazardous drinking. Interventions: Participants were randomized to one of five automated text message interventions for 12 weeks that interacted with participants on the 2 days per week that they typically drank: assisted self-monitoring (TRACK: control condition; n = 245), pre-drinking cognition feedback (PLAN; n = 226), alcohol consumption feedback (USE; n = 235), adaptive goal support (GOAL; n = 214) and a combination of interventions (COMBO; n = 221). Measurements: Primary outcome was number of past month binge drinking days at 3-month post-randomization calculated from a 30-day time-line follow-back. Primary intention-to-treat analysis compared PLAN, USE, GOAL and COMBO against TRACK (control condition). The four active conditions were not compared against each other. A secondary outcome, durability of effects, was measured at 6 months. Findings: From baseline to 3-month follow-up (retention = 81.1%), compared with TRACK, in which past-month mean binge drinking days increased from 2.7 to 3.4, mean binge drinking days decreased in COMBO from 3.0 to 2.3 [adjusted β = −0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) = –0.77, −0.26], GOAL from 3.0 to 2.6 (adjusted β = −0.34; 95% CI = –0.59, −0.10) and USE from 3.3 to 2.9 (adjusted β = −0.38; 95% CI = –0.62, −0.14). At 6 months (retention = 73.8%), COMBO, GOAL, USE and PLAN had significantly lower mean binge drinking days compared with TRACK. Conclusion: Text message interventions incorporating feedback on either drinking plans and/or alcohol consumption and/or drinking limit goal support produced small yet durable reductions in binge drinking days in non-treatment-seeking young adults with hazardous drinking. © 2022 Society for the Study of Addiction."
"Due to the technical words employed, which are primarily recognized by medical specialists, information retrieval in the medical area is sometimes described as sophisticated. Because of this, users frequently have trouble coming up with queries utilizing these medical phrases. However, this problem may be readily fixed by an information retrieval system that finds the pertinent terms that fit the user's query and automatically creates a ranking document using these keywords. To enhance the IR performance, the Automatic Query expansion method is applied by appending additional query terms for the medical domain. We propose a novel fuzzy-based Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) based on automatic query expansion. This work is mainly focused on filtering the most relevant augmented query by utilizing the synchronization score of IR evidence like normalized term frequency, inverse document frequency, and normalization of document length. The main aim of this work is to identify the medical terms that appropriately match the user's queries. The GOA algorithm ranks the terms based on relevance and then identifies the terms with the maximum synchronization value. The documents formed using the optimal expanded query are classified into three types, namely totally relevant, moderately relevant, and marginally relevant. Besides, the comparison of the proposed work is carried out for different performance metrics like Mean-Average Precision, F-measure, Precision-recall, and Precision rank are evaluated and analyzed by using TREC-COVID, TREC Genomics 2007, and MEDLARs medical datasets for the proposed and some of the state-of-art works. For a total of 60 queries, the proposed model offers an F1-Score of 0.964, 0.959, and 0.968 for the MEDLARS, TREC Genomics, and TREC COVID19 datasets, respectively. The E1-score and Mean Reciprocal Rate (MRR) of the proposed model is 0.8 and 0.9 when evaluated using the TREC COVID19 dataset. Performance analyses show that the proposed approach outperforms the other automatic keyword expansion approaches in the medical domain. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Background. Immersive virtual reality (iVR) facilitates surgical decision-making by enabling surgeons to interact with complex anatomic structures in realistic 3-dimensional environments. With emerging interest in its applications, its effects on patients and providers should be clarified. This systematic review examines the current literature on iVR for patient-specific preoperative planning. Materials and Methods. A literature search was performed on five databases for publications from January 1, 2000 through March 21, 2021. Primary studies on the use of iVR simulators by surgeons at any level of training for patient-specific preoperative planning were eligible. Two reviewers independently screened titles, abstracts, and full texts, extracted data, and assessed quality using the Quality Assessment Tool for Studies with Diverse Designs (QATSDD). Results were qualitatively synthesized, and descriptive statistics were calculated. Results. The systematic search yielded 2,555 studies in total, with 24 full-texts subsequently included for qualitative synthesis, representing 264 medical personnel and 460 patients. Neurosurgery was the most frequently represented discipline (10/24; 42%). Preoperative iVR did not significantly improve patient-specific outcomes of operative time, blood loss, complications, and length of stay, but may decrease fluoroscopy time. In contrast, iVR improved surgeon-specific outcomes of surgical strategy, anatomy visualization, and confidence. Validity, reliability, and feasibility of patient-specific iVR models were assessed. The mean QATSDD score of included studies was 32.9%. Conclusions. Immersive VR improves surgeon experiences of preoperative planning, with minimal evidence for impact on short-term patient outcomes. Future work should focus on high-quality studies investigating long-term patient outcomes, and utility of preoperative iVR for trainees. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Context: Pituitary tumors are the third most common brain tumor and yet there is no standardization of the surveillance schedule and assessment modalities after transsphenoidal surgery. Evidence acquisition: OVID, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library databases were systematically screened from database inception to March 5, 2020. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to capture studies examining detection of pituitary adenoma recurrence in patients 18 years of age and older following surgical resection with curative intent. Evidence synthesis: A total of 7936 abstracts were screened, with 812 articles reviewed in full text and 77 meeting inclusion criteria for data extraction. A pooled analysis demonstrated recurrence rates at 1 year, 5 years and 10 years for non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA; N = 3533 participants) were 1%, 17%, and 33%, for prolactin-secreting adenomas (PSPA; N = 1295) were 6%, 21%, and 28%, and for growth-hormone pituitary adenomas (GHPA; N = 1257) were 3%, 8% and 13%, respectively. Rates of recurrence prior to 1 year were 0% for NFPA, 1–2% for PSPA and 0% for GHPA. The mean time to disease recurrence for NFPA, PSPA and GHPA were 4.25, 2.52 and 4.18 years, respectively. Conclusions: This comprehensive review of the literature quantified the recurrence rates for commonly observed pituitary adenomas after transsphenoidal surgical resection with curative intent. Our findings suggest that surveillance within 1 year may be of low yield. Further clinical trials and cohort studies investigating cost-effectiveness of surveillance schedules and impact on quality of life of patients under surveillance will provide further insight to optimize follow-up. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Given their geographic location and political stability, Tyre, Beirut, and Byblos were major administrative and commercial centers along the Levantine coast during the Roman period. While archaeological research from Byblos suggests that the city prospered under Roman rule, it was mostly overshadowed by its coastal neighbors, Beirut and Tyre. In this paper we analyze the biodistances within and between three contemporary (1st–4th century AD) human skeletal assemblages from Byblos, Beirut, and Tyre. Dental measurements and nonmetric traits were recorded on 97 individuals. Both individual- and group-level analyses were performed; the individual-level analysis was based on PERMANOVA/PERMDISP using Gower distances, whereas the group-level analysis was based both on Gower distances and a Mahalanobis-type distance for mixed continuous and binary data. The results showed that Tyre and Beirut were more heterogeneous, that is, they exhibited higher intra-assemblage distances; this pattern was more prominent in Tyre. The inter-assemblage biodistances supported a relative proximity between Tyre and Beirut, followed by some affinity between Beirut and Byblos. In contrast, Tyre and Byblos were very divergent. The historical sources and literary texts support the idea that Beirut and Tyre, as key Roman colonies and commercial hubs in the Eastern Mediterranean, had high levels of mobility when compared to other coastal cities such as Byblos. Although more research is required, the integration of biodistance data with historical narratives has wide-reaching implications, especially in regions of the Eastern Mediterranean where human bioarchaeological research is actively developing. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Background: Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by recurrent sinopulmonary infections and worsening obstructive lung disease. Kidney and brain involvement is less common and is associated with overlapping ciliopathies/syndromes. The lungs are impacted early in the course of the disease, so it is vital to monitor lung function and recognize any decline by doing appropriate lung function tests. This systematic review compares different lung function tests and analyzes which one becomes abnormal earlier in the disease. Methods: A systematic review was conducted following the methodology in the “Cochrane Handbook on Systematic Reviews for diagnostic tests.” The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses were used to report the results. The risk of bias assessment was done using “The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews tool for interventional studies.” A meta-analysis was not performed due to the small sample size. All studies were analyzed by using Joanna Briggs Institute's critical appraisal tool. Results: After screening for the duplication of results and applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 14 studies were assessed by reading the full texts. Out of these, eight were finally included in this systematic review. The total sample size from all studies was 165, including 80 males. All the studies used spirometry as a lung function test, whereas multiple breath washout was used in five studies. Other tests used for comparison were computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 6-min walk test, DLCO, maximal inspiratory pressure, maximal expiratory pressure, and PaO2. Lung clearance index (LCI) by multiple breath washout had a stronger association with the structural changes on CT/MRI than spirometry indices like forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and forced expiratory flow at 25% to 75% of lung volume (FEF 25–75). Conclusions: Based on the evidence from this systematic review, LCI becomes abnormal earlier than FEV1 or FEF 25–75 and positively correlates with the findings on high-resolution CT. It has limitations like the lack of reference values and a complex technique to perform the test. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Can you make profits by trading on corporate disclosures using machine learning? In this study, we aim to obtain a conservative estimate of profitability, while accounting for the combination of several important real-world aspects. Specifically, we consider the holistic research problem that combines model predictions based on the textual content of corporate disclosures and trading strategies while accounting for transaction costs, order clearance periods, post-publication returns, and liquidity filtering. Furthermore, we aim to understand how the resulting profits are influenced by different model and trading strategy parameters. Based on 354,992 form 8-K filings and 10,204 ad hoc announcements, we find that the proposed trading strategies yield up to 7.81 % and 9.34 % out-of-sample annualized return. In addition, our results suggest that machine learning models should be provided with additional features about prior disclosures, while being trained on the ternary prediction problem that allows for predictions of neutral market reactions. We complement our results with several sensitivity analyses that show how profitability is influenced by transaction costs, different ensemble sizes, return neutrality thresholds, and liquidity filtering. Ultimately, we provide useful insights for practitioners by describing how the machine learning models arrive at decisions in terms of Shapley Additive Explanations. © 2022"
"The rapid recognition of rainstorm-induced emergencies (e.g., building and road inundation, facility damage, and trapped citizens) is vital to timely disaster response. One big challenge that limits the performance of emergency recognition is the data imbalance between different emergency domains. The present study aims to develop an effective cross-domain transfer learning framework for rainstorm-induced emergency recognition based on the text reports provided by citizens. The critical component of the framework is the use of joint distribution adaption (JDA) analysis embedded in a discriminative feature mapping procedure, which transfers rich knowledge learned from large-scale datasets to the learning task from small emergence data. Considering the feature incompleteness that is caused by short text length, a basic probability assignment function is constructed and applied to extract important spatial features for rainstorm emergency recognition, with an improved marginal Fisher analysis being adopted to optimize cross-domain text feature representation. The proposed scheme is validated using the empirical data of ten emergency classes from Wuhan City, China. Our experimental results show that the proposed method could significantly address data imbalance and thus help achieve high recognition performance through domain knowledge complementation. Meanwhile, the use of various spatial features is proved to be effective in tackling missing features. This scheme can be further developed into smart systems for rainstorm disaster response with reasonable performance and imbalanced sample sizes.  © 2022 American Society of Civil Engineers."
"Background: A shortage of specialist paediatric surgeons in Malaysia led to establishment of a national postgraduate training programme in 2004. We aimed to identify sociodemographic factors impacting training experience, and to define pressure points during training to inform targeted trainee support strategies. Methods: We conducted an anonymized online survey in June 2021 on all programme graduates. Participants were asked for sociodemographic data, both current and during training. Likert scale responses were required for questions regarding adequacy of support received for family, health and personal issues during training. A free text response question soliciting suggestions for programme improvement was included. Data are reported as median (range). Chi-square/Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables were used, with p<0.05 significance. Results: Of 53 eligible participants, 52 (98%) responded, 24 (46%) were female. Marital status was similar between genders at entry, but female trainees were more likely to be unmarried on exit (p = 0.001), and less likely to have children while training (p = 0.017). Of the 6 female and 18 male trainees who had children while training, women were more likely to take parental leave (p = 0.01). The majority felt advice given regarding parental leave and managing training while having children were poor. In thematic analysis of free text answers, lack of hands-on experience was the most common concern. Conclusion: Factors related to marriage and parenthood significantly associate with gender amongst trainees in Malaysia despite both genders being well represented. Concerns regarding adequacy of hands-on training highlight the need for educational innovations such as simulation models. Level of study: Level III. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"In the medical field, a doctor must have a comprehensive knowledge by reading and writing narrative documents, and he is responsible for every decision he takes for patients. Unfortunately, it is very tiring to read all necessary information about drugs, diseases and patients due to the large amount of documents that are increasing every day. Consequently, so many medical errors can happen and even kill people. Likewise, there is such an important field that can handle this problem, which is the information extraction. There are several important tasks in this field to extract the important and desired information from unstructured text written in natural language. The main principal tasks are named entity recognition and relation extraction since they can structure the text by extracting the relevant information. However, in order to treat the narrative text we should use natural language processing techniques to extract useful information and features. In our paper, we introduce and discuss the several techniques and solutions used in these tasks. Furthermore, we outline the challenges in information extraction from medical documents. In our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive survey in the literature with an experimental analysis and a suggestion for some uncovered directions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
"Senior online communities (SOCs) have become an important venue for older people to seek support and exchange information. While online community engagement has been well studied in the existing literature, few studies have explored how older adults behave in online communities. Therefore, drawing upon signaling theory, this study aims to investigate how different content-related and social-related signals influence users’ post replying behavior (i.e., reply to another user's post) in SOCs. We collected 7486 health-related posts and 71,859 comments from one of the most popular Chinese SOCs, Keai (https://www.keai99.com). Information signals in the posts were operationalized using different techniques such as text mining and social network analysis. Results from negative binomial regression indicated that content-related signals (posts’ topic and length) and social-related signals (authors’ position and centrality) were related to replying behavior. In addition, we revealed some differences between the effects of these signals on informational replies and emotional replies. More specifically, compared to posts mentioning traditional Chinese medicine, posts mentioning western medicine received more informational replies, but less emotional replies. Original posts triggered more informational replies, whereas shared posts attracted more emotional replies. Average reply length was positively related to informational replies, but negatively related to emotional replies. Considering the important role of SOCs in satisfying older adults’ social and informational needs, future research is needed to promote user social engagement in SOCs, thereby maintaining their sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the risk factors for primary Sjögren’s Syndrome (pSS) by conducting a meta-analysis of observational studies. Methods: Four electronic databases were searched from inception to August 2022. The search strategy included medical subject headings (MeSH) and text words. Outcomes were calculated and reported as the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Twelve studies consisting of nine case–control and three cohort studies were analyzed. Significant positive relationships between infection, a family history of autoimmune disease in first-degree relatives, negative stressful life events, CGGGG insertion/deletion polymorphisms in the IRF5 gene and the onset of pSS were found, with pooled ORs and 95% CIs of 2.73 (1.93, 3.86), 5.93 (3.34, 10.52), 1.69 (1.27, 2.24) and 2.69 (1.97, 3.66), respectively. In contrast, the results showed that a history of smoking was not associated with the onset of pSS, with a pooled OR and 95% CI of 1.39 (0.76, 2.53). However, a statistically significant negative association between current smoking and pSS was detected, with a pooled OR and 95% CI of 0.4 (0.29, 0.83). Conclusions: Our research indicated that infection, a family history of autoimmune disease in first-degree relatives, negative stressful life events and CGGGG insertion/deletion polymorphisms in the IRF5 gene might be risk factors for pSS. In contrast, our study demonstrated that a history of smoking was not associated with the onset of pSS, whereas current smoking was negatively associated with pSS onset.

"Engaging students in creating learning resources has demonstrated pedagogical benefits. However, to effectively utilize a repository of student-generated content (SGC), a selection process is needed to separate high- from low-quality resources as some of the resources created by students can be ineffective, inappropriate, or incorrect. A common and scalable approach is to use a peer-review process where students are asked to assess the quality of resources authored by their peers. Given that judgments of students, as experts-in-training, cannot wholly be relied upon, a redundancy-based method is widely employed where the same assessment task is given to multiple students. However, this approach introduces a new challenge, referred to as the consensus problem: How can we assign a final quality to a resource given ratings by multiple students? To address this challenge, we investigate the predictive performance of 18 inference models across five well-established categories of consensus approaches for inferring the quality of SGC at scale. The analysis is based on the engagement of 2141 undergraduate students across five courses in creating 12 803 resources and 77 297 peer reviews. Results indicate that the quality of reviews is quite diverse, and students tend to overrate. Consequently, simple statistics such as mean and median fail to identify poor-quality resources. Findings further suggest that incorporating advanced probabilistic and text analysis methods to infer the reviewers' reliability and reviews' quality improves performance; however, there is still an evident need for instructor oversight and training of students to write compelling and reliable reviews.  © 2008-2011 IEEE."
"Aim: To examine how school nurse practice evolved as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. Design: A scoping review of international literature, conducted and reported in line with Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) framework. Data Sources: Searches were conducted in September 2021. Ten databases were searched: The British Nursing Database, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Consumer Health Database, Health and Medicine, Nursing and Allied Health, Public Health, PsycINFO, PubMed and Web of Science. Relevant grey literature was identified through hand searching. Review Methods: A minimum of three reviewers independently screened articles and two reviewers independently undertook data extraction, with any decisions made collaboratively with the wider team. Much of the literature was not empirical work and so it was not possible to apply a traditional quality appraisal framework. Results: Searches identified 554 papers (after deduplication) which were screened against title and abstract. Following the full-text review, 38 articles underwent data extraction and analysis. The review findings highlighted that school nurses adapted their practice to ensure they were able to continue providing their formal and informal school health offer to children, young people and their families and continued working closely with the multidisciplinary team. In addition, the expanded public health role generated by Covid-19 for school nurses' work was considerable, multi-layered and added to their routine workload. School nurses displayed resilience, adaptability and creativity in their response to delivering services during Covid-19. Conclusion: School nurses took on a leading public health role during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some developments and practices were highlighted as beneficial to continue beyond the pandemic. However, formal evaluation is needed to identify which practices may merit integration into routine practice. Continued investment in staff and infrastructure will be essential to ensuring school nurses continue to expand their practice and influence as public health experts. © 2022 The Authors.

"It is indispensable to understand where the development of the Environmental-Social-Governance (further- ESG) concept is moving. People need to know where to develop in the future, and also understand whether the development of the ESG concept is going the right way. The primary objectives of the paper are to analyze ESG terminology from various sources, constract the ESG concept development model, and discover the relationship between tokens and the papers’ ESG presentation sequence. Four compression methods were considered in the paper: Doc2Vec from the Gensim library, MDS with cosine distance measure, tSNE with cosine distance measure, pre-compression of texts using Doc2Vec into a ten-dimensional space, followed by compression using the tSNE method with a cosine distance measure. The research analysis result shows 65 tokens and 14 bigrams. The experiment showed that dividing paragraphs into 70 clusters achieves the best clustering quality. The results show that the most vital link is between the words “ESG” and “firms”, as well as “stock”, “value”, “social”. “environmental”, and “risk”. It also found a strong connection with tokens “investment decisions” and “performance”, “significant company” and “effect”. With the increasing interconnections links between the “ESG-value-environmental-significant- influence”, the authors suppose that investors are becoming more environmentally conscious when making investment decisions. Although some challenges persist, including inconsistency in terminology, a considerable amount of data to analyze and heterogenous rating standards, ESG investing is likely to play an essential role in new environmentally-oriented values. © 2022 The Authors"
"Objective: To develop a patient-centered text message-based platform that promotes self-management of symptoms of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Methods: Adult women with IC/BPS interested in initiating a first- or second-line treatments per American Urological Association guidelines (recategorized as “behavioral/non-pharmacologic treatments” and “oral medicines” in the 2022 version) participated in rapid cycle innovation consisting of iterative cycles of contextual inquiry, prototype design and development. We delivered treatment modules and supportive messages using an algorithm-driven interactive messaging prototype through a HIPAA-compliant texting platform. Patients provided feedback through narrative text messages and an exit interview. Feedback was analyzed qualitatively and used to iteratively revise the platform until engagement ≥ 85% and accuracy ≥ 80% were achieved. The final version consisted of four treatment module categories (patient education and behavioral modification, cognitive behavioral therapy, pelvic floor physical therapy, and guided mindfulness practices) and supportive messages delivered through an automated algorithm over 6 weeks. Results: Thirty IC/BPS patients with moderate symptom bother (median IC Problem Index score 9, range 6−12) participated in five cycles of contextual inquiry. Qualitative analysis identified three overarching concepts that informed the development of the platform: preference for patient centered terms, desire to gain self-efficacy in managing symptoms, and need for provider support. Patients preferred the term “interstitial cystitis” to “bladder pain syndrome” which carried the stigma of chronic pain. Patients reported greater self-efficacy in managing symptoms through improved access to mind-body and behavioral treatment modules that helped them to gain insight into their motivations and behaviors. The concept of provider support was informed by shared decision making (patients could choose preferred treatment modules) and reduced sense of isolation (weekly check in messages to check on symptom bother). Conclusion: A patient centered text message-based platform may be clinically useful in the self-management of IC/BPS symptoms. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Introduction: Dental staining is a common concern for tobacco users. However, little is known about which components of tobacco are responsible for the staining and whether nicotine may be implicated. This is of increasing relevance with the popularity of novel products such as heated-tobacco products and electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes). Objectives: This systematic review aimed to establish the evidence base for the effect if any, of the various tobacco and nicotine products in causing staining of dental hard tissues and materials. Material and Methods: This systematic review was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines. There were four structured population intervention comparison outcomesquestions. A search was conducted up to December 2021 in three databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science, and manual searching of relevant sources was also completed. Two researchers individually reviewed the titles then abstracts and finally full articles. A reporting quality appraisal was conducted appropriately to the study methodology. Results: Of the 815 records titles identified, 56 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 27 were included for analysis. The included studies were mainly laboratory studies of varying reporting quality. There was evidence from 18 studies that tobacco exposure caused staining of dental hard tissues (pooled results from three studies- enamel/dentine; mean difference [MD]: 16.22; 95% confidence interval[12.11, 20.32; I2: 96%)and materials (pooled result from four studies—resin composite; MD: 11.90; 95% CI: 11.47, 12.34; I2: 100%). There was limited evidence that E-cigarettes 99%) and heated tobacco products (HTPs; pooled results from three studies–−1.07, 6.54; I2: 99%) cause staining, but this was lower than with traditional tobacco/found 11 compounds, of which 8 were terpenoids, from tobacco products implicated in causing staining. Finally, there was some evidence that resin composites stained more than other materials. Conclusions: Tobacco smoking causes dental staining. There was limited evidence that E-cigarettes and HTPs did cause dental staining that was less intense than that caused by traditional tobacco products. © 2022 The Authors.

"Background Assessment is necessary to ensure both attainment and maintenance of competency in gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy, and this can be accomplished through self-assessment. We conducted a systematic review with meta-analysis to evaluate the accuracy of self-assessment among GI endoscopists. Methods This was an individual participant data meta-analysis of studies that investigated self-assessment of endoscopic competency. We performed a systematic search of the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Wiley Cochrane CENTRAL, and ProQuest Education Resources Information Center. We included studies if they were primary investigations of self-assessment accuracy in GI endoscopy that used statistical analyses to determine accuracy. We conducted a meta-analysis of studies using a limits of agreement (LoA) approach to meta-analysis of Bland Altman studies. Results After removing duplicate entries, we screened 7138 records. After full-text review, we included 16 studies for qualitative analysis and three for meta-analysis. In the meta-analysis, we found that the LoA were wide (-41.0% to 34.0%) and beyond the clinically acceptable difference. Subgroup analyses found that both novice and intermediate endoscopists had wide LoA (-45.0% to 35.1% and -54.7% to 46.5%, respectively) and expert endoscopists had narrow LoA (-14.2% to 21.4 %). Conclusions GI endoscopists are inaccurate in self-assessment of their endoscopic competency. Subgroup analyses demonstrated that novice and intermediate endoscopists were inaccurate, while expert endoscopists have accurate self-assessment. While we advise against the sole use of self-assessment among novice and intermediate endoscopists, expert endoscopists may wish to integrate it into their practice. © 2022 Klinische Monatsblätter für Augenheilkunde.

"This article presents a 6.78-MHz wireless power transfer system with transmission power control. The proposed receiver (RX) with a simplified 0X/1X structure can achieve single-stage regulation in series-series resonant tank, where the charge and discharge cycle are only dependent on the hysteresis comparator. Asymmetric pulsewidth modulation is adopted in the proposed transmitter (TX), where the duty ratio (DTX) is switched based on the charge or discharge cycle of RX. With the proposed single-cycle-based DTX control, the DTX will be switched to 0.25 in the discharge cycle, while it is 0.5 in the charge cycle for maximum power transmission. Therefore, the end-to-end (E2E) efficiency especially at light-load conditions can be improved, and the recovery time is nearly instant when loading changes suddenly, i.e., neglectable voltage droop can be achieved. The RX is implemented by a printed circuit board and the TX is fabricated in a 0.18-μm CMOS technology. In the measurement, an output power range from 10 to 1000 mW is achieved with 60.6% peak E2E efficiency. The significant E2E efficiency improvement is observed over 10-255 mW and the maximum improvement is 16.1%. The measured load transient response verifies that the proposed design has instant response and neglectable voltage droop.  © 1986-2012 IEEE."
"Students with language-based learning disabilities (LBLD) can face elevated socio-emotional well-being challenges in addition to literacy challenges. We examined the prevalence of risk and resilience factors among adolescents with LBLD (N = 93), ages 16–18, and the association with reading performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected at the start and end of the first fully remote academic year of COVID-19 (2020–2021). Participants completed standardized word and text reading measures, as well as self-report surveys of executive functions (EF), and socio-emotional skills associated with resilience (grit, growth mindset, self-management, self-efficacy, and social awareness) or risk (anxiety, depression, COVID-19 related PTSD, and perceived COVID-19 impact). Survey data at the start of the school year (Time 1) captured three underlying factors associated with socioemotional risk, socioemotional resilience, and regulation (i.e., EF). Path analyses revealed that students’ Time 2 oral reading scores were significantly and uniquely predicted by socioemotional resilience, even when controlling for word-level reading at Time 1. Socioemotional risk, EF, and perceived COVID-19 impact were not directly related to Time 2 oral reading scores; however, students’ resilience mediated the associations between risk and reading outcomes. These results demonstrate that adolescents’ mental health concerns, self-regulatory ability, and socioemotional resilience were all associated with their experiences of the COVID-19-related stress. However, despite the high-risk context of the pandemic, and socio-emotional challenges faced by students with LBLD, our findings indicate that resilience directly predicts end-of-year reading outcomes and mediates the impact of socioemotional risk on achievement. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"According to recent trends, food production must double by 2050 to meet the world's growing population's expected demand. To achieve this goal, agri-food companies have begun implementing different digital technologies to increase food production while utilising fewer resources, thus reducing production processes' environmental impact. This study aims to review Industry 4.0 and agri-food sustainability research published in the last decade. Text classification and data extraction machine learning techniques have been used to support the literature review process. Notably, text classification was used to support the screening phase of titles and abstracts, while data extraction was used to support the content analysis phase by identifying the main topics on which documents are focused. The descriptive analysis shows a summary of the leading scientific journals in the research field, as well as the most influential countries and the research topic evolution over time. The results of the study allowed us to identify ten main research clusters, providing in-depth discussions and perspectives on critical areas for future research avenues. Finally, this study provides significant implications for the agri-food industry, suggesting firms redesign their business models according to a logic that prioritises long-term, shared value creation over short-term efficiency, and profitability. Incorporating digital technologies may help control farming activities' impact on soil and air quality, minimising the use of natural resources, pollutants, and CO2 emissions, thus providing long-term economic, environmental, and social advantages. © 2022"
"Hydrophones are pivotal measurement devices ensuring medical ultrasound acoustic exposures comply with the relevant national and international safety criteria. These devices have enabled the spatial and temporal distribution of key safety parameters to be determined in an objective and standardized way. Generally based on piezoelectric principles of operation, to convert generated voltage waveforms to acoustic pressure, they require calibration in terms of receive sensitivity, expressed in units of text{V}cdot Pa-1. Reliable hydrophone calibration with associated uncertainties plays a key role in underpinning a measurement framework that ensures exposure measurements are comparable and traceable to internationally agreed units, irrespective of where they are carried out globally. For well over three decades, the U.K. National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has provided calibrations to the user community covering the frequency range 0.1-60 MHz, traceable to a primary realization of the acoustic pascal through optical interferometry. Typical uncertainties for sensitivity are 6%-22% (for a coverage factor {k} = 2), degrading with frequency. The article specifically focuses on the dissemination of the acoustic pascal through NPL's calibration services that are based on a comparison with secondary standard hydrophones previously calibrated using the NPL primary standard. The work demonstrates the stability of the employed dissemination protocols by presenting representative calibration histories on a selection of commercially available hydrophones. Results reaffirm the guidance provided within international standards for regular calibration of a hydrophone in order to underpin measurement confidence. The process by which internationally agreed realizations of the acoustic pascal are compared and validated through key comparisons (KCs) is also described. © 1986-2012 IEEE."
"Background: In adolescents, technology use at bedtime is linked to disrupted sleep and psychological distress. Adolescents are known to sleep later on weekends compared to weekdays but whether this leads to greater technology use, and, hence, additional psychological distress is not known. At greater risk maybe adolescents with a late compared to early chronotype, that is a preference for late versus early sleep onset and offset times. Method: Self-reported measures of sleep timing, chronotype (early, neither early nor late, late), technology medium (social media/texting, TV/streaming, and gaming), and psychological distress (DASS-21) were collected from 462 students attending one Australian high school. Results: Technology use at bedtime was greater on weekends and especially in adolescents with a late chronotype. Social media/texting on weekends was predictive of delayed sleep onset times (β =.120), and shorter sleep (β = −.172). Shorter sleep on weekdays but not on weekends was associated with greater psychological distress. Technology medium and chronotype were not predictive of psychological distress. Conclusions: This study confirmed that technology use and its impact on sleep differed on weekdays compared to weekends and that a late chronotype was associated with greater technology use. However, neither technology medium nor chronotype was found to affect psychological distress. While greater autonomy may be granted to adolescents over the weekend regarding sleep behaviour, young people, parents, and clinicians should be mindful of the link between technology use and sleep. © 2022 The Authors.

"As the number of refugees continues to increase globally, so does the number of older adults forced to migrate from their home region to Western countries. Many of these older refugees lose their social networks and support to the events leading to forced migration and may be unable to recreate them once resettled. We used Arksey and O'Malley's (2005) framework to explore how forced migration has diminished the social networks and support of older refugees in Western countries and its impact on their emotional well-being. Eight databases were searched for the review; abstracts were reviewed using Rayyan QCRi(c) before the full-text review. A total of 25 studies were included in the final analysis, and findings revealed that forced migration reduced the quantity of social networks and the quality of social support older refugees received. The reduced social network and support led to social isolation, increased migration-related grief, and mental health challenges. Advances in digital technology are not yet capable of filling the support gap. With this, we hope to inform future research on the social support needs of older refugees and raise awareness of the need for humanitarian support intervention to cushion the impact of the migration-induced loss of social networks and support. © 2022"
"This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of tsunami evacuation models. The review covers scientific studies from the last decade (2012–2021) and is explicitly focused on models using an agent-based approach. The PRISMA methodology was used to analyze 171 selected papers, resulting in over 53 studies included in the detailed full-text analysis. This review is divided into two main parts: (1) a descriptive analysis of the presented models (focused on the modeling tools, validation, and software platform used, etc.), and (2) model analysis (e.g., model purpose, types of agents, input and output data, and modeled area). Special attention was given to the features of these models specifically associated with an agent-based approach. The results lead to the conclusion that the research domain of agent-based tsunami evacuation models is quite narrow and specialized, with a high degree of variability in the model attributes and properties. At the same time, the application of agent-specific methodologies, protocols, organizational paradigms, or standards is sparse. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Backgroud: Peripheral arterial disease can progress to critical limb ischemia, which requires revascularization. The endovascular approach is associated with a lower long-term patency due to restenosis resulting from neointimal hyperplasia. Statins offer significant advantages in patients undergoing percutaneous interventions. However, there are few studies on statin therapy associated with improved clinical outcomes after endovascular treatment in this patients. Aim: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the effects of statins (in comparison with no statin) on outcomes of lower-limb arterial angioplasty by evaluating patency, amputation and mortality. Method: We searched MEDLINE, Academic Search Premier and CINAHL using a predetermined search strategy from inception to September 21, 2022. Study selection (first by title and abstract and then by full text) and data extraction was conducted by two independent reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. According to data availability, we conducted meta-analysis using RevMan v.5.4. Results: The search identified 841 relevant articles and included 10 studies with 43,543 patients. Statin use in patients before undergoing lower-limb arterial angioplasty was associated with improved primary patency at 12 (12.57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.86–18.28, p < 0.0001) and 24 months (7.19%, 95% CI 1.02–13.37, p = 0.02), decreased mortality in 39% at 12 months (relative risk (RR): 0.61, 95% CI 0.55–0.74, p < 0.00001) and decreased limb loss in 23% in the studied patients (RR: 0.77, 95% CI 0.65–0.91, p = 0.003). Conclusion: Statin therapy before the procedure was associated with significantly improved patency and overall survival and decreased limb loss after lower-limb arterial angioplasty. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Background: No conclusive recommendations exist regarding use of abdominal drainage in hepatectomy. The practice of abdominal drainage remains commonplace despite unfavorable outcomes reported by randomized controlled trials. We aimed to compare the impact of abdominal drainage on outcomes of hepatectomy. Methods: A systematic search of electronic information sources and bibliographic reference lists was conducted. A combination of free text and controlled vocabulary search adapted to thesaurus headings, search operators, and limits in each of the above databases was applied. Overall perioperative and wound-related complications, bile leak, intra-abdominal collections (including those requiring an intervention), and the length of hospital stay were the evaluated outcome parameters. Results: Seven randomized controlled trials reporting 1,064 patients undergoing hepatectomy with (n = 533) or without (n = 531) placement of abdominal drain were included. Patients in both groups were of comparable age (P = .23), sex (P = .49), proportion of major hepatectomy (P = .93), minor hepatectomy (P = .96), cirrhosis (P = .78), and malignant pathologies (P = .61). Drainage after hepatectomy was associated with significantly higher overall complications (RR: 1.37, P = .0003) and wound-related complications (risk ratio: 2.29, P = .01) compared to no drainage. Moreover, there was no significant difference in bile leak (risk ratio: 2.15, P = .19), intra-abdominal collections (risk ratio: 1.13, P = .70), intra-abdominal collections requiring interventions (risk ratio: 1.19, P = .71), or length of hospital stay (mean difference: 0.37, P = .67) between the 2 groups. The trial sequential analysis confirmed conclusiveness of the findings. Conclusion: Abdominal drainage after hepatectomy increases overall and wound-related complications, without any reduction in the risk of intra-abdominal collections needing an intervention. Routine drainage after an uncomplicated hepatectomy should be avoided, with the possible exception of the presence of a bilioenteric anastomosis. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Aims/Hypothesis: Identifying risk factors for tinnitus could facilitate not only the recommendations for prevention measures, but also identifying potential pathways for new interventions. This study reports the first comprehensive systematic review of analytical observational studies able to provide information about causality (i.e., case–control and cohort designs). Methods: A literature search of four electronic databases identified epidemiological studies published on tinnitus and different exposures. Independent raters screened all studies, extracted data, and evaluated study quality using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale. Reported relative risks (RR), hazard ratios (HR), odds ratios (OR), and prevalence ratios (PR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to compute crude estimates of RR for tinnitus risk factors. Results: From 2389 records identified, a total of 374 articles were read as full text (24 reviews, 301 cross-sectional studies, 42 cohort studies, and 7 case–control studies). However, from 49 case–control and cohort studies, only 25 adequately reported risk ratios. Using the findings from these studies, positive causal associations were found for various hearing-related factors (i.e., unspecified hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss, occupational noise exposure, ototoxic platinum therapy, and otitis media). Evidence was also found for a number of non-otological risk factors including temporo-mandibular joint disorder, depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hyperlipidemia. Negative associations indicating preventative effects were found for diabetes and high alcohol consumption. No associations were found for low alcohol consumption, body mass index, head injury, heart failure, hypertension, leisure noise exposure, migraine, rheumatoid arthritis, sex, smoking, stroke, and whiplash. However, with the exception of unspecified hearing loss, these findings resulted from pooling no more than 4 studies, illustrating that the vast majority of the associations still remain inconclusive. Conclusions: These systematic review and meta-analysis confirm a number of otological and non-otological risk factors for tinnitus. By highlighting major gaps in knowledge, our synthesis can help provide direction for future research that will shed light on the pathophysiology, improve management strategies, and inform more effective preventions. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Background: As opioid prescriptions have risen, there has also been an increase in opioid use disorder (OUD) and its adverse outcomes. Accurate and complete epidemiologic surveillance of OUD, to inform prevention strategies, presents challenges. The objective of this study was to ascertain prevalence of OUD using two methods to identify OUD in electronic health records (EHR): applying natural language processing (NLP) for text mining of unstructured clinical notes and using ICD-10-CM diagnostic codes. Methods: Data were drawn from EHR records for hospital and emergency department patient visits to a large regional academic medical center from 2017 to 2019. International Classification of Disease, 10th Edition, Clinic Modification (ICD-10-CM) discharge codes were extracted for each visit. To develop the rule-based NLP algorithm, a stepwise process was used. First, a small sample of visits from 2017 was used to develop initial dictionaries. Next, EHR corresponding to 30,124 visits from 2018 were used to develop and evaluate the rule-based algorithm. A random sample of the results were manually reviewed to identify and address shortcomings in the algorithm, and to estimate sensitivity and specificity of the two methods of ascertainment. Last, the final algorithm was then applied to 29,212 visits from 2019 to estimate OUD prevalence. Results: While there was substantial overlap in the identified records (n = 1,381 [59.2 %]), overall n = 2,332 unique visits were identified. Of the total unique visits, 430 (18.4 %) were identified only by ICD-10-CM codes, and 521 (22.3 %) were identified only by NLP. The prevalence of visits with evidence of an OUD diagnosis in this sample, ascertained using only ICD-10-CM codes, was 1,811/29,212 (6.1 %). Including the additional 521 visits identified only by NLP, the estimated prevalence of OUD is 2,332/29,212 (7.9 %), an increase of 29.5 % compared to the use of ICD-10-CM codes alone. The estimated sensitivity and specificity of the NLP-based OUD classification were 81.8 % and 97.5 %, respectively, relative to gold-standard manual review by an expert addiction medicine physician. Conclusion: NLP-based algorithms can automate data extraction and identify evidence of opioid use disorder from unstructured electronic healthcare records. The most complete ascertainment of OUD in EHR was combined NLP with ICD-10-CM codes. NLP should be considered for epidemiological studies involving EHR data. © 2022"
"The present work shows a computational tool developed in the MATLAB platform. Its main functionality is to evaluate a thermal model of the breast. This computational infrastructure consists of modules in which manipulate the infrared images and calculate breast temperature profiles. It also allows the analysis of breast nodules. The different modules of the framework are interconnected through an interface which the major purpose is to automatize the whole process of the infrared image analysis, in a quick and organized way. The tool is initially supplied with a three-dimensional mesh that represents the substitute geometry of the patient’s breast together with her infrared images which are transformed into temperature matrices. Through these matrices, the frontal and lateral mappings are performed by specified modules. This process generates an image and a text file with all the temperatures associated to the nodes of the surface mesh. The developed tool is also able to manage the use of a commercial mesh generation program and a computational fluid dynamics code, the FLUENT, in order to validate the technique by the use of a parametric analysis. In these analyses, the tumor may have several geometric shapes and different locations within the breast.

"Introduction: Patient engagement in youth mental health research has the potential to inform research on the interventions, services and policies that will benefit youth. At present, there is little evidence to guide mental health researchers on youth engagement. This systematic review aims to describe the impacts of youth engagement on mental health research and to summarize youth engagement in mental health research. Methods: We searched the following databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE and PsycINFO, using a combination of subject headings, keywords and synonyms for the concepts ‘patient engagement’, ‘youth’ and ‘mental health’. Articles that described engaging youth in mental health research were included. Two reviewers performed the study selection. Study characteristics, research activities performed by youth, impacts of youth engagement, challenges, and facilitators to engagement and recommendations for youth engagement described by authors were extracted. Quality appraisal involved determining the level of engagement of youth and the stage(s) of research where youth were involved. Results: The database search returned 2836 citations, 151 full-text articles were screened and 16 articles, representing 14 studies, were selected for inclusion. Youth were involved at nearly all stages of the research cycle, in either advisory or co-production roles. Youth engagement impacts included enhancing relevant research findings, data collection and analysis and dissemination to academic and stakeholder audiences. Both youth and academic researchers reported personal development across many domains. One negative impact reported was the increase in funding and resources needed for engagement. We produced a list of 35 recommendations under the headings of training, youth researcher composition, strategy, expectations, relationships, meeting approaches and engagement conditions. Conclusions: This study provides an understanding of the impacts and recommendations of youth engagement in mental health research. The findings from this study may encourage researchers to engage youth in their mental health research and support youth engagement in funding applications. Patient and Public Contribution: We consulted three youths with experience being engaged in mental health research about the review findings and the discussion. One youth designed a visual representation of the results and provided feedback on the manuscript. All youth's input informed the way the findings were presented and the focus of the discussion. © 2022 The Authors. Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"There are typographical errors within the article and these have been corrected below: In Table 1, the VATI value for weight stable patients is incorrect and is currently written as a repeat of the value above [55.52 (48.40–64.22)]: (Figure presented.) The correct value for weight stable VATI is, in fact, 66.12 (24.02–87.17). The corresponding P value remains correct. In para 1 of p. 1145, we say: ‘Comparing VAT between the groups, we found 2,200 probesets regulated (10-fold up to 2.3-fold down) between CC and CWS, and 1253 probesets regulated (nine-fold up to 2.3-fold down) between CC and control’. The sentence should read: ‘Comparing VAT between the groups, we found 2200 probesets regulated (FDR < 0.05; 10-fold up to 2.3-fold down) between CC and control, and 1253 probesets regulated (FDR < 0.05; 9-fold up to 2.3-fold down) between CWS and control’. The corresponding data in the Abstract and Table 2 remain correct. In Figure 6, the patient groups are labelled incorrectly. Specifically, the ‘CC’ (cancer cachexia) group has been labelled ‘CWL’ (meaning cancer weight-losing, our previous term for this group of patients). ‘CWL’ has not been used as a term in the rest of the manuscript, and it would be more consistent and helpful to the reader to continue to label the group ‘CC’. There is also a missing P value. We include a new version of Figure 6 below with the correct labels. The corresponding text in the manuscript remains correct. (Figure presented.) The methodological technique of principal components analysis has been misspelt throughout the manuscript as principle components analysis. Specifically, this occurs on three occasions: the 1st paragraph of p. 1144; the last paragraph of p. 1144; and the legend to Figure 1 on p. 1144. © 2022 The Authors.

"Abstract: The manuscript aims to clarify the origins of Western rhinosurgery through the ancient texts of the greatest physicians of the past, up to the Byzantine Era, focusing on the “exchange of knowledge” between peoples. This excursus is carried out by quoting the texts of the greatest doctors of the past, such as Hippocrates, Galen and Celsus and by analysing the works of Byzantine authors such as Oribasius, Aetius, Antillus, which, more than others, represent the moment of fusion and interpenetration of Ancient Medical knowledge, paving the way for the Medieval Scholae Medicae in the West. The aim, therefore, is to fill that sort of ""great gap"" (from the foundation of Constantinople in the 4th century AD to the early Arab culture in the 11th century AD) due to the fact that figures such as Branca, Vianeo and, finally, Tagliacozzi, are considered direct actors of a recovery of the “ancient knowledge” of classic authors. This literature tends to less evaluate, instead, that important and huge cultural exchange -literally osmotic- in medical and surgical knowledge between peoples and civilizations, that find a trait d'union in the application of medical knowledge and surgical practical techniques matured in the Byzantine, Arab and Early Medieval period. In final analysis, through the History of Rhinosurgery, this paper aims to highlight how Western medical knowledge is made up of the ensemble of cultures which are apparently distant and different from each other, which merge themselves in a truly universal and transcultural knowledge: the Medical knowledge.

"Issue addressed: Retention of weight gained during pregnancy contributes to overweight and obesity and consequent chronic disease risk. Early programs have been successful in improving diet quality, physical activity levels and reducing postnatal weight retention. However, barriers to program engagement remain. This study aimed to investigate women's healthy eating, physical activity and weight experiences and explore their views regarding digital health interventions to assist meeting their lifestyle goals. Methods: This qualitative descriptive study utilised semi-structured interviews with women who had recently become mothers who had gestational diabetes or a body mass index above 25 kg/m2. Themes were then identified through thematic analysis of interview transcripts. Results: Nine women were interviewed (average age 33.4 ± 4.2 years). The two distinct areas of questioning resulted in two overarching topics: (i) Enablers and barriers to maintaining regular physical activity and a healthy dietary pattern; and (ii) characteristics of a postpartum program to enable meeting of diet, physical activity and weight loss goals. These topics each had their own descriptive themes and sub-themes. Conclusions: Understanding women's needs and viewpoints for a postnatal diet, physical activity and weight program allows researchers to design a program to maximise engagement and outcomes. So what?: Any further postnatal program must leverage off existing infrastructure, integrate learnings from published formative work and harnesses the impact of digital delivery. This will improve program accessibility and provide ongoing contact for sustained behaviour change through text messaging and providing digital resources in a dynamic format women can engage with in their own time. © 2022 The Authors.

"Despite improved ancillary investigations in epilepsy care, patients' narratives remain indispensable for diagnosing and treatment monitoring. This wealth of information is typically stored in electronic health records and accumulated in medical journals in an unstructured manner, thereby restricting complete utilization in clinical decision-making. To this end, clinical researchers increasing apply natural language processing (NLP)—a branch of artificial intelligence—as it removes ambiguity, derives context, and imbues standardized meaning from free-narrative clinical texts. This systematic review presents an overview of the current NLP applications in epilepsy and discusses the opportunities and drawbacks of NLP alongside its future implications. We searched the PubMed and Embase databases with a “natural language processing” and “epilepsy” query (March 4, 2022) and included original research articles describing the application of NLP techniques for textual analysis in epilepsy. Twenty-six studies were included. Fifty-eight percent of these studies used NLP to classify clinical records into predefined categories, improving patient identification and treatment decisions. Other applications of NLP had structured clinical information retrieval from electronic health records, scientific papers, and online posts of patients. Challenges and opportunities of NLP applications for enhancing epilepsy care and research are discussed. The field could further benefit from NLP by replicating successes in other health care domains, such as NLP-aided quality evaluation for clinical decision-making, outcome prediction, and clinical record summarization. © 2022 The Authors.

"In this brief, the Time-Division Multiplier (TDM)-based electronic wattmeter has be integrated for the first time. To integrate the wattmeter and properly select parameters for its circuit, this brief provides the modeling of TDM and the theoretical analysis of three types of errors, which improved the TDM theory. Based on these analysis, the considerations for designing the circuits of the modules of TDM are provided. Besides, the analysis using root locus theory for notch filter design are also provided, which simplified the initialization and determination of the design parameters. The wattmeter circuits, whose maximum input voltage and current amplitudes are ±15 V and ±2.5 mA respectively, is integrated into a chip manufactured by a 0.35- \mu \text{m} high-voltage semiconductor process and occupying area of 1.6\times2.5 mm2. And the precision of this integrated wattmeter is sub-100 ppm, represented by relative systematic error.  © 2004-2012 IEEE."
"This research asks: ‘were there any objectively identifiable signals in the words leaders used in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic that can be associated with ineffective management of the crisis?’ We chose to focus on the leaders of the two English-speaking nations that fared worst and best in the pandemic, the United States and New Zealand. By way of background and in order to contextualise the research, we compared and contrasted Trump’s and Ardern’s leaderships using the toxic triangle framework of destructive leadership. We then focused on the leader behaviour element of the triangle by using computerised text analysis (CTA) to analyse Trump’s and Ardern’s public pronouncements during the critical early stages of the pandemic. Based on a similarity index (S), we identified linguistic markers associated with destructive leader behaviours and negative outcomes (Trump) and non-destructive leader behaviours and positive outcomes (Ardern). We discuss future applications of these linguistic markers for the diagnosis both of incumbent and potential leaders’ responses to crises management. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Objective: This qualitative study examines the linguistic features associated with postpartum depression. Methods: In this longitudinal online study, 53 mothers completed self-report questionnaires assessing symptoms of postpartum depression and an expressive writing exercise about their pregnancy and birth. Mothers were randomly divided into two groups (intervention and control groups). Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count [LIWC] was used to examine the written data for depression and no depression groups. Results: The overall use of words varied depending on the severity of depressive symptoms. Negative emotions and introspective terms were associated with depression and lower use of first-person plural pronouns but not singular pronouns. Additionally, the groups of individuals with depression showed a positive correlation between depressive symptoms and words referring to friends, leisure activities, the body, breastfeeding, exercise, and eating attitudes. Conclusion: In addition to self-disclosure, word analysis and appropriate categorization could be useful for perinatal symptomatology in pregnant women, and interestingly also a meaningful tool that can be taught and used as a preventive care measure among pregnant and postpartum women. © 2022"
"Control algorithms for programmable logic controllers are still developed based on the experience of those responsible for control in the industry. The IEC-61131-3 standard considers five programming languages: Ladder Diagram, Structured Text, Function Block Diagram, Instruction List, and Sequential Function Diagram, which use different function blocks to develop control algorithms. Within the control algorithms for discrete event systems, there are two types of blocks: those with discrete inputs and outputs, and those with discrete and analog inputs and discrete output. Of the latter, the present research shows the analysis and formal model of the blocks including the problems of accumulation of tokens and the restoration of the coils. This proposal includes logical blocks of timers, counters, positive and negative transition detectors and bistable elements, which, together with the AND, OR, AND-OR, contact lock, auto-loop and Set-Reset logics, can be modeled and analyzed control algorithms with a greater degree of complexity. This guarantees the safety of workers as well as machines. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."
"Rural vitalization (RV) has attracted more and more attention in China, especially since the Rural Vitalization Strategy (RVS) was proposed to restrict rural decline in 2017. The evaluation of RV is an effective means to objectively identify the characteristics and problems of rural development, so exploring scientific and rational evaluation methods is important for sustainable rural development. Therefore, this study builds a data-driven evaluation framework from a “bottom-up” perspective, and selects Hubei Province as the object to evaluate the effectiveness of RV. The evaluation index system is formed based on the concept and connotation of RV, which contains six dimensions, namely thriving businesses (TB), pleasant living environments (PLE), social etiquette and civility (SEC), effective governance (EG), living in prosperity (LP), and organization system (OS). The empirical results indicate that there is a low level of variation of the total scores but an obvious disparity in the dimensional scores in 13 prefecture-level and 83 county-level regions. At county-level, the regional development stage has an impact on the effectiveness of RV, and regions with a higher economy or endowed with better resources perform better. The results of spatial analysis further reveal that there is regional agglomeration as well as differences in various dimensions, and regions with characteristic industries or policy support perform better. Compared with the traditional evaluation method, differentiated evaluation objectives and diversified data are considered in the evaluation process of this study. The results and discussion shown in this study could provide empirical evidence for policymakers to effectively promote RV in the future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Objective: To assess deviation from a standardised structure of surgical time-out procedures in a multidisciplinary referral hospital. Materials and Methods: An observational process audit was performed on a convenience sample of surgical cases. A fly-on-the-wall observer assessed surgical time-out procedures in real-time. Pre-induction and recovery checklists were not assessed. Observations were recorded on standardised reporting forms including a checklist and free text. Analysis was performed using a validated framework of four conceptual domains: the purpose, occasion, audience and content of the communication. Field notes were taken to allow retrospective verification of assessments. Observations were compared to a predefined standardised surgical time-out procedure structure. Results: Twenty surgical time-out procedures were observed from a mixture of procedure types. Although all were performed at the specified time and place, only eight (40%) were considered to have fully achieved their purpose with potentially important sections of the communication being omitted in the others. Individuals were not ready for communication to begin in 14 (70%) and distractions occurred in 11 surgical time-out procedures (55%). In seven surgical time-out procedures (35%) superfluous information was communicated. Clinical Significance: In a busy operating theatre environment, surgical time-out procedures may not be performed as they are intended. Communication during surgical time-out procedures should be audited to highlight opportunities for improvement. © 2022 British Small Animal Veterinary Association."
"Purpose: Fall prevention is a safety goal in many hospitals. The performance of the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) in older inpatients is largely unknown. We aimed to assess the JHFRAT performance in a large sample of Dutch older inpatients, including its trend over time. Methods: We used an Electronic Health Records (EHR) dataset with hospitalized patients (≥ 70), admitted for ≥ 24 h between 2016 and 2021. Inpatient falls were extracted from structured and free-text data. We assessed the association between JHFRAT and falls using logistic regression. For test accuracy, we calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Discrimination was measured by the AUC. For calibration, we plotted the predicted fall probability with the actual probability of falls. For time-related effects, we calculated the AUC per 6 months (using data of patients admitted during the 6 months’ time interval) and plotted these different AUC values over time. Furthermore, we compared the model (JHFRAT and falls) with and without adjusting for seasonal influenza, COVID-19, spring, summer, fall or winter periods. Results: Data included 17,263 admissions with at least 1 JHFRAT measurement, a median age of 76 and a percentage female of 47%. The in-hospital fall prevalence was 2.5%. JHFRAT [OR = 1.11 (1.03–1.20)] and its subcategories were significantly associated with falls. For medium/high risk of falls (JHFRAT > 5), sensitivity was 73%, specificity 51%, PPV 4% and NPV 99%. The overall AUC was 0.67, varying over time between 0.62 and 0.71 (for 6 months’ time intervals). Seasonal influenza did affect the association between JHFRAT and falls. COVID-19, spring, summer, fall or winter did not affect the association. Conclusions: Our results show an association between JHFRAT and falls, a low discrimination by JHFRAT for older inpatients and over-prediction in the calibration. Improvements in the fall-risk assessment are warranted to improve efficiency. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to European Geriatric Medicine Society."
"In the toolbox for environmental governance under urban governments, is environmental institutional supply an effective tool to advance the improvement of economic growth quality? This study used data mining and text analysis to obtain the institutional data of 278 cities in China on environmental pollution management and assesses the quality of urban economic growth from the perspective of pollution reduction and total factor productivity improvement. Regression analysis with the temperature inversion in cities as the instrument confirms that environmental institution supply has significantly reduced the PM2.5 emission concentration in China's urban economic growth. Increasing environmental institutional supply has a more salient effect on green transformation in inland cities relative to coastal cities. In a more in-depth discussion, we combined productivity analysis that considering resource and environmental constraints and panel quantile regression and found that, while having a positive effect on cities in the lower quantile of total factor productivity, environmental institutional supply has a negative effect on cities in the higher quantile. Promoting green technological innovation and increasing employment in the field of environmental protection are important channels for environmental institutional supply that shapes a green urban economy. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Objective: To determine effectiveness of text/telephone outreach messages, with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine information. Study design: We conducted an intent-to-treat, multiarm, randomized clinical trial with adolescents aged 12-17 years. Eligible patients did not have an adolescent well-care visit in the past year or scheduled in the next 45 days or an active electronic health record portal account. We randomized participants to the standard message, COVID-19 vaccine message, or no message (control) group and delivered 2 text messages or telephone calls (per family preference) to the message groups. The primary outcome was adolescent well-care visit completion within 8 weeks, and secondary outcomes were adolescent well-care visit scheduled within 2 weeks and receiving COVID-19 vaccine within 8 weeks. Results: We randomized 1235 adolescents (mean age, 14 ± 1.5 years; 51.6% male; 76.7% Black; 4.1% Hispanic/Latinx; 88.3% publicly insured). The standard message group had higher odds of scheduling an adolescent well-care visit compared with the control group (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.21-3.52) and COVID-19 vaccine message group (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.00-2.74). The odds of completing an adolescent well-care visit did not differ significantly (standard message group vs control group; OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 0.88-2.06; COVID-19 vaccine message group vs control group, OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 0.87-2.03). In per-protocol analyses, adolescents in the standard message group were twice as likely as the control group to receive the COVID-19 vaccine (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.05-5.86). Conclusions: Outreach messages were minimally effective. Efforts are needed to address widening disparities. Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04904744. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"In response to the many changes and uncertainties facing the future, sensing opportunities for innovation is an important agenda. Formulating strategies for sensing opportunities in innovation requires an ecosystem perspective that integrates the science, technology, and business (S-T-B) fields that shape the innovation ecosystem. This study was to identify potential in the innovation ecosystem focusing on a text mining technique and similarity-based analysis, which is the fundamental concept of Literature-Based Discovery, an approach to deriving hidden associations between two areas in bibliometric databases. The purpose of this study was sensing innovation opportunities through intelligent trends and interaction analysis in S-T-B fields in the value chain of smart grids, which is the research target area. Topic modeling, and cosine similarity measurements were carried out using scientific papers, patents, business publication data corresponding to the S-T-B ecosystem. Through multi-dimensional data sources corresponding to the S-T-B fields, the evolutionary path of the smart grid value chain and its potential as a strategic tool for future innovative challenges were identified. This study has practical and policy implications in that it identifies a niche in the innovation system and provides meaningful information that could contribute to the revitalization of participation in the private sector and consumers. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"We inhabit two worlds – the world of matter and the world of meaning (see Halliday, ‘On matter and meaning: The two realms of human experience, 2005). In this article, these two worlds and the physical, biological, social and semiotic systems that connect them are investigated. In this respect, semiotic systems are the most complex because they involve physical systems (the material sign), biological systems (human beings), social systems (society and culture) and meaning itself. Semiotic frameworks need to take into account these various dimensions as changes in one system reverberate across the meta-system as a whole. With this in mind, the interplay between material and semiotic worlds from a social semiotic perspective, are explored with a focus on meaning and its significance in relation to human existence. Using examples from various industrial ages, the article explores how semiotic resources (in this case, in mathematics, science and computer programming languages) are organized to structure reality in specific ways, and how semiotic combinations and the technologies arising from those constructions have changed the course of human history. In this discussion, attention is paid to the role of visual communication, both in terms of visual semiotic resources (e.g. graphs, digital images) and visual aspects of multimodal texts. It thus becomes evident that the functionalities of any one semiotic resource (including language) must be viewed in relation to its collective co-deployment with other semiotic resources. Lastly, the author examines semiosis in the digital age and considers the social implications of the current digital ecosystem. In doing so, she conceptualizes digital technologies as a one-way mirror where members of society use digital media for every facet of their lives while being watched, analysed and manipulated by those who have designed and own the digital platforms. It is apparent that semiotics has a major role to play in terms of design, policymaking and activism around future digital technologies. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Objective: To examine the effect of interventions used to enhance cognitive function in patients experiencing cancer-related cognitive impairment. Methods: Studies including adults with a non-metastatic cancer who have received chemotherapy as part of their treatment and who have undergone interventions targeting cancer-related cognitive impairment were included. Studies involving patients with metastatic cancer and pre-existing cognitive deficits were excluded. Academic Search Complete, CINAHL Plus with full text, MEDLINE, Education Full Text, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and ERIC were searched for studies published between January 2011 and September 2022. Data extraction and quality appraisal were conducted by two authors and cross-checked by the review team. Quality appraisal was conducted using 12 items from the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. Findings were presented narratively without meta-analysis. Results: Thirty-one studies were included. Interventions were categorised as integrative/complementary, cognitive behavioural therapy and compensatory strategies, exercise, psychoeducational/psychosocial, brain-training, and pharmacological. Over 100 instruments were identified, including the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive, Trail Making Tests-A and B, and instruments measuring secondary outcomes, including depression. Instruments often measured attention and concentration, language, memory, executive function, and/or patient-reported outcomes. Improvements were reported, with most studies measuring some or various aspects of cognitive functioning and very few studies measuring all domains of cognitive functioning, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions about effectiveness. Conclusions: Various interventions are available to treat cancer-related cognitive impairment. Outcome measurement was inconsistent and future research should prioritise using standardised measures. Current evidence, whilst not being definitive, suggests that certain interventions show greater promise than others, including cognitive behavioural therapy and brain training. © 2022 The Authors.

"Introduction: Patient-centred care (PCC) has come to the forefront for many institutions, funding agencies and clinicians, and is integrated into care. Does a disconnect in understanding still exist between patients, healthcare organizations and clinicians in what PCC means and how outstanding issues might be addressed?. Methods: We conducted interviews and focus groups with self-reported chronic care patients and clinicians providing care to these patients exploring PCC experiences, expectations and practices. These data were initially analysed using inductive thematic analysis. This paper reports on the findings of a secondary analysis examining the alignment between patients and clinicians on five key predetermined dimensions of PCC. Results: Eighteen patients participated, representing a range of chronic conditions. Thirty-eight clinicians participated. One thousand and three hundred patient and 1800 clinician codes were identified and grouped into 5 main topics with 140 unique themes (patients) and 9 main topics with 54 unique themes (clinicians). A total of 166 quotes (patient = 93, clinician = 73) were identified for this PCC definition alignment analysis. Partial or complete alignment of patient and clinician perspectives was seen on most dimensions. Key disconnects were observed in patient involvement, patient empowerment and clinician–patient communication. Only 18% of patients reported experiencing patient-centred communication, whereas 57% of clinicians reported using patient-focused communication approaches. Conclusion: Overall, study patients and clinicians endorse that many PCC elements occur. This study highlights key differences between patients and clinicians, suggesting persistent challenges. Clinician participants relayed their PCC approaches of informing and educating patients; however, patients often perceive these approaches as didactic, role-diminishing and noncollaborative. Collaborative approaches, such as shared decision-making, hold promise to bridge persistent PCC gaps and should be integrated into medical education programmes. Patient or Public Contribution: This project was conceived and executed with a co-design approach wherein patients with chronic conditions who are trained in research (i.e., see descriptions of Patient and Community Engagement Research in the text) were involved in all stages of the research project alongside other researchers on the project team. Healthcare providers were involved as participants and as principal investigators in the project. © 2022 The Authors. Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"While donation-based crowdfunding for health-related purposes raises hundreds of millions of dollars yearly, most campaigns fail to meet their fundraising goals. Crowdfunding campaigners are advised to seek traditional news media coverage of their campaigns to increase donor interest and fundraising success. In this study, we seek to better understand what happens to donor behavior via donation-based crowdfunding campaigns after they receive news media coverage. While research has focused on the impact of social media sharing on donation-based crowdfunding, academic analyses of the impact of news media coverage is largely speculative. We searched the Newsstream and Factiva databases for Canadian news coverage of domestic donation-based health-related crowdfunding campaigns. This news coverage was paired with the crowdfunding campaign reported on in the story. Campaign text and daily fundraising totals and donor amounts were recorded for the 7 days before and after publication of the news article. The authors identified emergent patterns in this data around the amplification of personal information from the crowdfunding campaign to a wider audience and inclusion of new personal details. This process identified 17 relevant pairs of news stories and crowdfunding campaigns over a review period of just under 5 months in 2021–22. These campaigns raised a total of CAD$443,134 (median CAD$20,030) out of a total goal of CAD$772,500 (median CAD$40,000) or 57.4% of the requested funds. Median campaign donations and donor numbers increased for the 3 days following publication of the news article. Our exploratory analysis shows a relationship between crowdfunding campaigns that receive news media coverage and the numbers of donations and total amount donated shortly after this coverage. Campaigners may feel pressure to participate in news media coverage in order to reach their fundraising goals. Media coverage has implications for campaign recipient privacy and the equitable distribution of health-related funding. This exploratory analysis establishes the need for additional research on this topic. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Background: The effect of the ABCDEF bundle (Assess, prevent, and manage pain; Both spontaneous awakening and spontaneous breathing trials; Choice of analgesia and sedation; Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage; Early mobility and exercise; and Family engagement and empowerment) on patient outcomes such as delirium is potentially optimised when the bundle is implemented in its entirety. Objective: To systematically synthesise the evidence on the effectiveness of the ABCDEF bundle delivered in its entirety on delirium, function, and quality of life in adult intensive care unit patients. Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data source: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Joanna Briggs Institute's Evidence Based Practice, Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, and Embase were searched from 2000 until December 2021. Review methods: Inclusion criteria included (1) adult intensive care unit patients (2) studies that described the ABCDE or ABCDEF bundle in its entirety (3) studies that evaluated delirium, functional outcomes, or quality of life. Studies were excluded if they investigated long-term intensive care unit rehabilitation patients. Two reviewers independently screened records and full text, extracted data, and undertook quality appraisals with discrepancies discussed until consensus was reached. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted for delirium but was not possible for other outcomes. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to assess the certainty of the synthesised findings of the body of evidence. The study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD 42019126407). Results: A total of 18 studies (29,576 patients) were included in the descriptive synthesis. Meta-analysis of six studies (2000 patients) identified decreased delirium incidence following implementation of the ABCDEF bundle when compared with standard practice, (risk ratio = 0.57; CI, 0.36–0.90 p = 0.02) although heterogeneity was high (I2 = 92%). When compared with standard practice, a meta-analysis of five studies (3418 patients) showed the ABCDEF bundle statistically significantly reduced the duration of intensive care unit delirium (mean difference (days) – 1.37, 95% CI -2.61 to − 0.13 p = 0.03; I2 96%). Valid functional assessments were included in two studies, and quality of life assessment in one. Conclusions: Although the evidence on the effect of the ABCDEF bundle delivered in its entirety is limited, positive patient delirium outcomes have been shown in this meta-analysis. As this meta-analysis was based on only 4736 patients in eight studies, further evidence is required to support its use in the adult intensive care unit.

"Background: Patients with the dementia subtype idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) may improve clinically following cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion (shunt) surgery, though the predictors of shunt response remain debated. Currently, radiological features play an important role in the diagnosis of iNPH, but it is not well established which radiological markers most precisely predict shunt responsive iNPH. Objective: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify radiological predictors of shunt responsiveness, evaluate their diagnostic effectiveness, and recommend the most predictive radiological features. Methods: Embase, MEDLINE, Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and JSTOR were searched for original studies investigating radiological predictors of shunt response in iNPH patients. Included studies were assessed using the ROBINS-1 tool, and eligible studies were evaluated using a univariate meta-analysis. Results: Overall, 301 full-text papers were screened, of which 28 studies were included, and 26 different radiological features were identified, 5 of these met the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis: disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space (DESH), callosal angle, periventricular white matter changes, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and computerized tomography cisternography. The meta-analysis showed that only callosal angle and periventricular white matter changes significantly differentiated iNPH shunt responders from non-responders, though both markers had a low diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 1.88 and 1.01 respectively. None of the other radiological markers differentiated shunt responsive from shunt non-responsive iNPH. Conclusion: Callosal angle and periventricular changes are the only diagnostically effective radiological predictors of shunt responsive iNPH patients. However, due to the DORs approximating 1, they are insufficient as sole predictors and are advised to be used only in combination with other diagnostic tests of shunt response. Future research must evaluate the combined use of multiple radiological predictors, as it may yield beneficial additive effects that may allow for more robust radiological shunt response prediction. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Objective: Diet may have an impact on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) development; nevertheless, controvertible studies have been published. The aim of this study was to provide evidence from analytical studies on the relationship between diet and GDM development. Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, ISI Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched for articles published in the English language from Jan 2005 to Dec 2020. We included observational studies, assessed their risk of bias, and extracted data on association between diet status and GDM development. Keywords were selected based on the Mesh terms, which included gestational diabetes mellitus“, “GDM”, “diet,” “nutrition,” “food,” “dietary pattern which was combined by ""OR"" and ""AND"" Boolean operators. Two reviewers (SHA and PM) independently reviewed abstracts and full-text articles and extracted data. Results: Among the 5 articles included, 4 were case-control and one was a cross-sectional study. Studies have shown that diets with a high intake of saturated fatty acids (more than 10% of total daily fat intake) and trans fatty acids (more than 1% of total daily fat intake) before and during pregnancy significantly increase the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: High intake of saturated fat and trans fat before and during pregnancy can disturb glucose metabolism and increase the risk of GDM, although all of the studies recommend more widespread observational and clinical trials studies to identify the exact relationship between high saturated and trans fatty acids intake and GDM. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers."
"The natural languages are medium of communication from the inception of civilization. As the technology improves, the text messages, voice messages and videos are the addons in medium of communication. In long distance communication, the analysis of expression is modern area of research. The parameters of assessment are subjective hence the emotion recognition is challenging task. This article furnishes the investigation of various machine learning techniques and novel methods for speech emotion recognition (SER) to determine the feeling/sentiments in a speech. Here, we investigate the three machine learning methods named multinominal Naive Bayes (MNB), logistic regression (LR), and linear support vector machine (LSVM). Further, these techniques are incorporated with the proposed method. The performance of these machine learning techniques is investigated on two different datasets. The datasets consist of voice and text data samples. The prosed method is trained and tested on these datasets. As per the experimentation, it has been observed that the LSVM has outperformed the other two machine learning techniques. © 2023 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved."
"Introduction: The concept of normalization of deviance describes the gradual acceptance of deviant observations and practices. It is founded upon the gradual desensitization to risk experienced by individuals or groups who recurrently deviate from standard operating procedures without encountering negative consequences. Since its inception, normalization of deviance has seen extensive, but segmented, application across numerous high-risk industrial contexts. The current paper describes a systematic review of the existing literature on the topic of normalization of deviance within high-risk industrial settings. Method: Four major databases were searched in order to identify relevant academic literature, with 33 academic papers meeting all inclusion criteria. Directed content analysis was used to analyze the texts. Results: Based on the review, an initial conceptual framework was developed to encapsulate identified themes and their interactions; key themes linked to the normalization of deviance included risk normalization, production pressure, culture, and a lack of negative consequences. Conclusions: While preliminary, the present framework offers relevant insights into the phenomenon that may help guide future analysis using primary data sources and aid in the development of intervention methods. Practical Applications: Normalization of deviance is an insidious phenomenon that has been noted in several high-profile disasters across a variety of industrial settings. A number of organizational factors allow for and/or propagate this process, and as such, the phenomenon should be considered as an aspect of safety evaluations and interventions. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"Due to its accessibility and anonymity, the Internet is a common way for mothers to find information about parenting concerns. The purpose of this study was to explore the parenting questions posted by mothers on parenting online communities to identify the informational needs of parents with young children. We analyzed 31,565 parenting–related questions posted in October 2019. Text mining was performed using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify the most common topics in the dataset. Topics were sorted according to infant age group and a keyword network analysis was performed to identify parenting difficulties. In the LDA, 15 topics were found to be the best-fitting model. From these, we identified parenting situations that lead to many questions, the majority of which were focused on basic childcare related to feeding, baby food, sleeping, medical problems, development, and learning. The distribution of the 15 topics varies according to age group. Keyword network analysis showed that mothers had difficulty putting their babies to sleep and stopping them from crying. This study provides useful information to support parenting and makes suggestions for how parenting programs can meet mothers’ needs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"The construction work classification code is a crucial index for consistently collecting unit cost data from the bill of quantities (BOQ). Appropriate classification codes assigned to detailed construction work item descriptions are required to verify project cost and for quality control. However, the codification system is complicated and time consuming for estimators to follow. This study proposes a framework to recognize the text of detailed construction work item descriptions in the BOQ and automatically assign the most similar work classification code. The automatic assignment algorithm was designed to score the similarity of the tokenized words in the work item description based on whether they contain the same word. The framework was experimented with using the national roadway BOQ; this BOQ is used for the procurement process in South Korea. It transformed work item descriptions from unstandardized BOQs into standardized data with more than 91.12% accuracy. The results of this study can be used as a prerequisite step for standardizing construction life cycle cost data and the automatic generation of BOQs.  © 2022 This work is made available under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license,."
"Background and objective: Periodontitis (PD) is a dysbiotic disease of tooth-supporting structures that has been associated with various systemic diseases including rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To date, evidence demonstrated increased prevalence of RA among PD patients and postulated PD to have a role in the development of autoantibodies in RA patients. Therefore, a systematic review was conducted to assess the available evidence to ascertain the effect of PD on levels of autoantibodies in the serum, saliva and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) of RA patients. Material and methods: The systematic review was conducted in compliance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Relevant literature was searched from PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Ebscohost databases from inception until 31 August 2020. The risk of bias in each study was determined based on the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale tool. Results from random-effect meta-analyses were presented as summary estimates of odds ratios (ORs) for seropositivity and standardised mean difference (SMD) of autoantibody levels with 95% confidence intervals. Sensitivity tests and meta-regression were performed to assess the robustness of the results and potential cause of heterogeneity. Results: The electronic and manual searches gathered 932 articles. Following screening and full-text assessment, a total of 29 studies were included in the analysis. Twenty-eight published observational studies were included in the quantitative analysis in the form of random-effect meta-analysis which revealed that PD was associated with anti-citrullinated proteins autoantibodies (ACPAs) and Rheumatoid Factor (RF) seropositive RA patients (OR for ACPA seropositivity: 1.82; 95% CI: 1.13–2.93) (OR for RF seropositivity: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.05–2.24). Also, RA patients with PD had increased serum levels of ACPA and RF. However, high heterogeneity among studies' results, partially ascribed to the unstandardised case definition of PD and laboratory testing of autoantibodies. Apart from ACPA and RF in serum, studies which reported on other RA-related autoantibodies, as well as autoantibody levels in saliva and GCF were scarce. Conclusion: RA patients with PD tend to have greater ACPA and RF levels in their serum when compared with the RA patients without PD supporting the plausible role of PD in the development of systemic autoimmunity in RA patients. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

"The Iliad, by the Greek poet Homer, is a precious mine of examples of war traumatology. In the specific case of spear wounds in the chest, the death of the Trojan warrior Alcathous is particularly interesting from the point of view of the history of medicine and the evolution of cardiology and knowledge of the heart at the time of ancient Greece. In particular this paper aims to evidence and reconstruct the main anatomical and physiological knowledge of the heart at that time. Indeed, a historical-linguistic analysis of the Greek text prompts some reflections and thoughts on the heartbeat in pathological conditions and on the function of the heart as a hematopoietic organ. Furthermore, Homer's account is a critical text that highlights the relevance of the use of the senses in the ancient description of nosological pictures and it allows us an interesting and suggestive approach to reconstruction from the historical and historiographical point of view. © 2022"
"Objective: To study reactions of control group participants allocated to two different presentations of basic health information in a digital alcohol intervention trial. Method: Control participants were randomised to wait with one of two different presentations of basic health information. Multiple choice questions and free-text comments assessed reactions, four months post randomisation. Effects of differential health information on responses were estimated, as were associations between responses, baseline characteristics and change in alcohol consumption. Result: Of 1066 control group participants, 572 (54%) responded to the questionnaire. Contrasting two different presentations of basic health information revealed no statistically significant differences. Responses revealed that 38% were interested sufficiently to look at the information while 42% felt frustration, irritation, or disappointment about having to wait. Approximately 55% responded that they decided to reduce their drinking whilst 17% stated that they continued to drink as usual, and 11% gave up on the idea of reducing their drinking. The two latter groups reported markedly higher alcohol consumption at follow-up in comparison to the former (probability of association >99.9%). Conclusion: Being made to wait may invite negative research participation effects. Practice implication: Comparator guidance should be updated to reflect the potentially negative consequences which are under researched. © 2022 The Authors"
"Clinical supervision is critical for the uptake of psychotherapy but difficult to facilitate in countries with limited providers, resources, and internet infrastructure. Innovative supervision approaches are needed to increase access to mental health treatments in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs). This study examined the content and feasibility of remote WhatsApp text supervision conducted as part of an open clinical trial in Somaliland. Islamic Trauma Healing ITH) is a brief, group, lay-lead, trauma-focused, mosque-based intervention that has demonstrated initial efficacy in pilot studies in the United States and Somaliland. After a 2-day, in-person training, lay leaders led four groups of five to seven members focused on trauma-related psychopathology and community reconciliation. Somali lay leaders trained in ITH (n = 9) and the research team (n = 6) attended weekly WhatsApp supervision during the intervention. Content was logged and subjected to qualitative analysis by two coders. Comments related to intervention implementation indicated that lay leaders understood the treatment rationale, adhered to treatment procedures, and believed the intervention components to be helpful and culturally relevant. Themes related to engagement suggested perfect attendance across groups and high levels of participation. Lay leader psychoeducation and skill development; supervisor praise, support, and encouragement; and supervisee gratitude emerged as additional themes. Remote text supervision conducted via WhatsApp was technologically feasible and may have facilitated skill development and the effective implementation of this lay-led intervention. When tailored to the local context, remote supervision approaches hold promise for increasing access to services in LMICs with limited resources. © 2022 ReedGroup Ltd.

"The COVID-19 outbreak has affected everyday lives worldwide. As governments started to implement confinement and business closure measures, the economic impact was felt by entire societies immediately. The urgency of such a theme has led researchers to study the phenomenon. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to provide the state of the art on relevant dimensions and hot topics of research to understand the economic impacts of COVID-19. In this survey, we conduct a text mining analysis of 301 articles published during 2020 which analyzed such economic impacts. By defining a set of relevant dimensions grounded on existing literature, we were able to extract a set of coherent topics that aggregate the collected articles, characterized by the predominance of a few sets of dimensions. We found that the impact on “financial markets” was widely studied, especially in relation to Asia. Next, we found a more diverse range of themes analyzed in Europe, from “government measures” to “macroeconomic variables.” We also discovered that America has not received the same degree of attention, and “institutions,” “Africa,” or “other pandemics” were studied less. We anticipate that future research will proliferate focusing on several themes, from environmental issues to the effectiveness of government measures. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the rapid expansion of telehealth service delivery. We explored the experiences of a multidisciplinary palliative care team delivering telepalliative care for oncology inpatients during a 10-weeks COVID-19 surge in New York City. Methods/Participants: We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with a targeted sample, employing a phenomenological approach with applied thematic text analysis. An interdisciplinary coding team iteratively coded data using a mix of a priori and inductive codes. Team members first independently reviewed each category, then met to reach consensus on recurring themes. The sample (n = 11) included a chaplain (n = 1), social worker (n = 1), pharmacist (n = 1), physicians (n = 3), physician assistant (n = 1), and nurse practitioners (n = 4). Results: Participants described multidimensional clinician distress as a primary experience in delivering telepalliative care during the COVD-19 surge, characterized by competing loyalties (e.g., institutional obligations, ethical obligations to patients, resentment and distrust of leadership) and feelings of disempowerment (e.g., guilt in providing subpar support, decisional regret, loss of identity as a provider). Participants provided explicit recommendations to improve telepalliative care delivery for acute oncology inpatients in the future. Conclusion: Palliative care clinicians experienced personal and professional distress providing inpatient telepalliative care during this COVID-19 surge. Clinician strain providing telehealth services must be explored further as the pandemic and utilization of telehealth evolves. Telepalliative care planning must include attention to clinician wellbeing to sustain the workforce and promote team cohesion, and a focus on infrastructure needed to deliver high-quality, holistic care for oncology patients and their families when in-person consultation is impossible. © The Author(s) 2022."
"The delayed resonator (DR) is an active vibration absorber, which yields ideal vibration suppression at its resonance frequency. In this study, we further complement the DR design in a distinctive mechanical path by introducing an amplifying mechanism (AM), so the creation of DRA. Very different from the existing works that focus more on how to enhance the ideal vibration suppression of the DR, we are interested in how the DR behaves under uncertainties and how can the newly proposed DRA abate the arising negative effects. First, we study the effects of such uncertainties in detecting the excitation frequency on the quality of vibration suppression, working space of the absorber, and energy cost. Then, we discuss how the control parameter perturbation affects the system stability. A comparative study between the classic DR and the proposed DRA is presented throughout the text, showing that the enhanced performance and robustness characteristics enabled by the AM are almost all-around while posing no additional controller complexity. We also show using spectral analysis that the AM can also enhance the transient behavior of the system. Finally, three numerical simulations included as core studies vividly exhibit DRA’s practical strength. Copyright © 2022 by ASME."
"Background: Screen behaviours are highly prevalent in adolescents and may be adversely associated with physical and mental health. Understanding how screen behaviours inter-relate with physical activity and sleep may help to clarify pathways through which they impact health and potential routes to behaviour change. This cross-sectional study examines the association of contemporary screen behaviours with physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep in adolescents. Method: Data are from sweep 6 (2015/2016) of the Millennium Cohort Study, conducted when participants were aged 14 years. Outcome variables were accelerometer-assessed overall physical activity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), self-reported sedentary behaviour and sleep duration. Screen behaviours were assessed using a 24-h time-use diary. Multivariable regression was used to examine the association between screen behaviours and each outcome variable separately for weekdays and weekend days. Results: The use of social network sites was associated with (beta coefficient, 95% confidence interval (CI); minutes/day) less time in MVPA (weekdays: − 5.2 (− 10.3, − 0.04); weekend: − 10.0 (− 15.5, − 4.5)), and sedentary behaviours (weekdays: − 19.8 (− 31.0, − 8.6); weekend: − 17.5 (− 30.9, − 4.1)). All screen behaviours were associated with shorter sleep duration on weekdays, whereas only the use of email/texts and social network sites was associated with shorter sleep duration on weekend days. The association of using social network sites with overall physical activity was stronger in girls than in boys; the association of internet browsing with sedentary behaviour was stronger in boys than in girls. Conclusion: Intervention strategies to enhance MVPA and sleep duration by limiting screen-based activities may be warranted. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"This paper compares the practice of holding prime ministers to account in four case studies: Australia, Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Using text analysis, as well as research on prime ministerial responsibilities, it investigates oral questions asked in parliamentary procedures where prime ministers are questioned together with ministers (Question Period in Canada and Question Time in Australia) versus procedures where they are questioned individually (PMQs in the United Kingdom and Oral Questions to the Taoiseach in Ireland), and explores the degree to which they are questioned for matters that are within their remit. It argues that the practice of prime ministerial accountability is decisively shaped by procedural features such as whether written notice is required for questions, as well as by the broader role of the questioning mechanism in the political system, and less by the collective or individualised nature of questioning. © The Author(s) 2021."
"Internet-Delivered Psychological Treatment (IDPT) has become necessary in the medical field. Deep neural networks (DNNs) require large, diverse patient populations to train models that achieve clinician-level performance. However, DNN models trained on limited datasets have poor clinical performance when used in a new location with different data. Thus, increasing the availability of diverse as well as distinct training data is vital. This study proposes a structural hypergraph as well as an emotional lexicon for word representation. An embedding model based on federated learning was developed for mental health symptom detection. The model treats text data as a collection of consecutive words. The model then learns a low-dimensional continuous vector while maintaining contextual linkage. The generated models with attention-based mechanisms as well as federated learning are then tested experimentally. Our strategy is suitable for vocabulary diversification, grammatical word representation, as well as dynamic lexicon analysis. The goal is to create semantic word representations using an attention network model. Later, clinical processes are used to mark the text by embedding it. Experimental results show the encoding of emotional words using the structural hypergraph. The 0.86 ROC was achieved using the bidirectional LSTM architecture with an attention mechanism.  © 2013 IEEE."
"Background: Natural language processing (NLP) may be a tool for automating trauma teamwork assessment in simulated scenarios. Methods: Using the Trauma Nontechnical Skills Assessment (T-NOTECHS), raters assessed video recordings of trauma teams in simulated pre-debrief (Sim1) and post-debrief (Sim2) trauma resuscitations. We developed codes through directed content analysis and created algorithms capturing teamwork-related discourse through NLP. Using a within subjects pre-post design (n = 150), we compared changes in teams' Sim1 versus Sim2 T-NOTECHS scores and automatically coded discourse to identify which NLP algorithms could identify skills assessed by the T-NOTECHS. Results: Automatically coded behaviors revealed significant post-debrief increases in teams' simulation discourse: Verbalizing Findings, Acknowledging Communication, Directed Communication, Directing Assessment and Role Assignment, and Leader as Hub for Information. Conclusions: Our results suggest NLP can capture changes in trauma team discourse. These findings have implications for the expedition of team assessment and innovations in real-time feedback when paired with speech-to-text technology. © 2022 Elsevier Inc."
"Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a class of effective deep generative models, with the objective to approximate the true, but unknown data distribution. VAEs make use of latent variables to capture high-level semantics so as to reconstruct the data well with the help of informative latent variables. Yet, training VAEs tends to suffer from posterior collapse, when the decoder is parameterized by an autoregressive model for sequence generation. VAEs can be further enhanced by introducing multiple layers of latent variables, but the posterior collapse issue hinders the adoption of such hierarchical VAEs in real-world applications. In this paper, we introduce InfoMaxHVAE, which integrates mutual information estimated via neural networks into hierarchical VAEs to alleviate posterior collapse, when powerful autoregressive models are used for modeling sequences. Experimental results on a number of text and image datasets show that InfoMaxHVAE can outperform the state-of-the-art baselines and exhibits less posterior collapse. We further show that InfoMaxHVAE can shape a coarse-to-fine hierarchical organization of the latent space.  © 1979-2012 IEEE."
"Aim: The study aimed to critically review and synthesize the best available evidence about the effectiveness of therapist-guided internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) in terms of reducing sickness absence (SA). Methods: We searched Medline (PubMed), Embase, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central (up to November 2020) for English language peer-reviewed papers that described randomized controlled trials of therapist-guided iCBT compared with usual treatment for SA in adults with common mental disorders. Eligible studies were assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias 1 tool, meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effects model, and standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. A subgroup analysis investigated potential moderating variables (diagnosis, SA at baseline, and estimated accuracy of self-report). Results: We identified 2788 references, of which 68 remained after the completion of the systematic screening process. A hand search of reference lists yielded no additional studies. The full texts of these 68 studies were appraised critically, and 11 were deemed to be suitable for a meta-analysis. SA was similar for iCBT and usual treatment groups (SMD: 0.02, 95% CI, –0.08 to 0.11), and remained similar even after the removal of two studies in which the recall time was over 3 months (SMD: 0.00, –0.11 to 0.12). Similar SA levels in intervention and control groups at 6-month and 12-month follow-up were observed in studies of participants with depression symptoms. Conclusions: iCBT did not appear to be effective in terms of reducing (largely self-assessed) SA in adults with common mental disorders. There is a need to improve the method and consistency of assessing SA. © Author(s) 2022."
"The backbone of the semantic web is ontology, dealing with the context of details associated with a specific domain. Domain ontology (DO) is an important source of information for knowledge-based systems. Nonetheless, developing DO is a time-consuming procedure that is heavily reliant on the developer's expertise. Here, a novel semi-automated technique for creating Ontologies in the terrorism domain is suggested. Terrorism actions provide critical information that can be used to improve a country's security system. To obtain the most up-to-date knowledge of the domain, online social network (OSN) data, specifically Twitter text data, is retrieved, and then concepts and associated relationships are recognized and mapped through formal concept analysis (FCA). The fluent editor tool (FET) displays a number of user-defined associations. Knowledge is also extracted using a query-based approach and a reasoner window in the FET. The created DO is broadcast on the web using an ontology web language (OWL) that may be used in a variety of other applications. The suggested work is notable because it creates broad-coverage DO for the terrorist domain using a tool called Fluent Editor (FE) instead of the typical tool (protégé), and semantic information is retrieved with 100% correctness, similar to a query-based search system (QBS). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management."
"Following the deaths of many Black Americans in spring 2020, public consciousness rose around the societal mega-threat of racism. In response, many organizations released public statements to condemn racism and affirm their stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). However, little is known about the specific thematic contents covered in such diversity statements and their implications on important organizational outcomes. Taking both inductive and deductive approaches, we conducted two studies to advance our understanding in this area. Study 1 employed structural topic modeling (STM)—an advanced unsupervised machine-learning text-mining technique—and comprehensively analyzed the latent semantic topics underlying the diversity statements publicly released by Fortune 1000 companies in late May and early June 2020. The results uncovered six underlying latent semantic topics: (1) general DEI terms, (2) supporting Black community, (3) acknowledging Black community, (4) committing to diversifying the workforce, (5) miscellaneous words, and (6) titles and companies. Furthermore, drawing from the identity-blindness and identity-consciousness theoretical frameworks and leveraging millions of data points of employees’ DEI ratings retrieved from Glassdoor.com, Study 2 further tested and supported hypotheses that companies were more positively rated by their employees on organizational diversity and inclusion if they (1) released (vs. did not release) diversity statements and (2) emphasized identity-conscious (vs. identity-blind) topics in their diversity statements. Our findings shed light on important theoretical implications for the current research and offer practical recommendations for organizational scientists and practitioners in diversity management. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Background: In clinical trial development, it is a critical step to submit applications, amendments, supplements, and reports on medicinal products to regulatory agencies. The electronic common technical document is the standard format to enable worldwide regulatory submission. There is a growing trend of using R for clinical trial analysis and reporting as part of regulatory submissions, where R functions, analysis scripts, analysis results, and all proprietary code dependencies are required to be included. One unmet and significant gap is the lack of tools, guidance, and publicly available examples to prepare submission R programs following the electronic common technical document specification. Methods: We introduce a simple and sufficient R package, pkglite, to convert analysis scripts and associated proprietary dependency R packages into a compact, text-based file, which makes the submission document self-contained, easy to restore, transfer, review, and submit following the electronic common technical document specification and regulatory guidelines (e.g. the study data technical conformance guide from the US Food and Drug Administration). The pkglite R package is published on Comprehensive R Archive Network and developed on GitHub. Results: As a tool, pkglite can pack and unpack multiple R packages with their dependencies to facilitate the reproduction and make it an off-the-shelf tool for both sponsors and reviewers. As a grammar, pkglite provides an explicit trace of the packing scope using the concept of file specifications. As a standard, pkglite offers an open file format to represent and exchange R packages as a text file. We use a mock-up example to demonstrate the workflow of using pkglite to prepare submission programs following the electronic common technical document specification. Conclusion: pkglite and the proposed workflow enable the sponsor to submit well-organized R scripts following the electronic common technical document specification. The workflow has been used in the first publicly available R-based submission to the US Food and Drug Administration by the R Consortium R submission working group (https://www.r-consortium.org/blog/2022/03/16/update-successful-r-based-test-package-submitted-to-fda). © The Author(s) 2022."
"Due to the continuous progression of social media networking sites, people share their thoughts, viewpoints, videos, speech and images through short texts. But the short texts are manually understandable but hard for the machine to collect data for clarification. The limited terms present in the short texts seem difficult while categorizing, analyzing as well as evaluating. Since social media and Bibliographic repositories like Digital Bibliography and Library Project (DBLP) contains a substantial amount of information, it is necessary to mine only useful information from the existing short texts. To achieve effectiveness and efficiency in short text categorization, the content-related characteristics derived from various machine learning techniques are admired. The significant objective of the proposed approach involves the categorization of short text and enhancing its accuracy, which can improve further ﬁnding collaborative research communities. In this work, a hybrid convolutional neural network-long short term memory (CNN-LSTM) based new Caledonian crow optimization (NC2LO) model is utilized to classify the short texts. The crows utilize both social and asocial learning for developing tool modelling skills. Getting attracted to the behaviour of this variety of crows, and motivated by the learning strategy of crows, a new Caledonian crow optimization model referred to as NC2LO model is established. The conceptual framework of the proposed methodology consists of four different phases namely the data collection phase, data preparation phase, data pre-processing phase and short text categorization phase to classify the short texts with a high accuracy rate. Then, the proposed CNN-LSTM based NC2LO for short text categorization is evaluated using four different types of datasets namely IMDb, AG news, Twitter, and Tagmy News. Finally, the comparative analysis is carried out to evaluate the accuracy rate for various approaches and the analysis demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves a high accuracy rate of about 97%. © 2022"
"Integrating outside knowledge for reasoning in visio-linguistic tasks such as visual question answering (VQA) is an open problem. Given that pretrained language models have been shown to include world knowledge, we propose to use a unimodal (text-only) train and inference procedure based on automatic off-the-shelf captioning of images and pretrained language models. More specifically, we verbalize the image contents and allow language models to better leverage their implicit knowledge to solve knowledge-intensive tasks. Focusing on a visual question answering task which requires external knowledge (OK-VQA), our contributions are: (i) a text-only model that outperforms pretrained multimodal (image-text) models of comparable number of parameters; (ii) confirmation that our text-only method is specially effective for tasks requiring external knowledge, as it is less effective in standard a VQA task (VQA 2.0); and (iii) our method attains results in the state-of-the-art when increasing the size of the language model. We also significantly outperform current multimodal systems, even though augmented with external knowledge. Our qualitative analysis on OK-VQA reveals that automatic captions often fail to capture relevant information in the images, which seems to be balanced by the better inference ability of the text-only language models. Our work opens up possibilities to further improve inference in visio-linguistic tasks. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"In this study, a novel Improved Affine Algorithm (IAA) for color image encryption is proposed. Affine Algorithm (AA) is generally known as an algorithm used for plain text encryption. In the proposed IAA algorithm, Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR), XOR encryption, and the AA are combined for color images encryption. The plane image is firstly split into three channels: R, G, and B. The RGB channel image is encrypted using AA encryption with ten keys based on pixel locations and pixel values. The rows and columns of the image are encrypted with LFSR keys and XOR encryption procedures. Finally, the proposed algorithm is tested in Matlab environment to obtain the Histogram, Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Unified Average Changing Intensity (UACI), Number of Pixel Change Rate (NPCR), and Entropy analyses. The values are compared with other algorithms. The results show that the proposed image encryption algorithm is secure and powerful, outperforming other algorithms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Binarization is an essential pre-processing step for many document image analysis tasks. Binarization of handwritten documents is more challenging than printed documents because of the non-uniform density of ink and the variable thickness of strokes. Instead of traditional scanners, people nowadays use the mobile camera to capture documents, including text written on white and glass boards. The quality of the camera-captured document images is often poor when compared with scanned document images. This impacts binarization accuracy. This paper presents a deep learning-based binarization framework called Deep Semantic Binarization (dsb) to binarize various document images. We pose document image binarization problem as a pixel-wise two-class classification task. Deep networks (including dsb) require many training images during training. However, the benchmark datasets with a limited number of training images are publicly available in the literature. We explore various training strategies, including transfer learning, to handle the data scarcity during training. Due to the unavailability of mobile-captured whiteboard and glass board images, we created two datasets, namely wbids-iiit and gbids-iiit, with associated ground truths. We validate dsbn on the public benchmark dibco dataset and wbids-iiit and gbids-iiit datasets. We empirically demonstrate that the dsb outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques for wbids-iiit, gbids-iiit and public datasets. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Research Summary: Researchers increasingly use unstructured text data to construct quantitative variables for analysis. This goal has traditionally been achieved using keyword-based approaches, which require researchers to specify a dictionary of keywords mapped to the theoretical concepts of interest. However, recent machine learning (ML) tools for text classification and natural language processing can be used to construct quantitative variables and to classify unstructured text documents. In this paper, we demonstrate how to employ ML tools for this purpose and discuss one application for identifying artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in patents. We compare and contrast various ML methods with the keyword-based approach, demonstrating the advantages of the ML approach. We also leverage the classification outcomes generated by ML models to demonstrate general patterns of AI technological innovation development. Managerial Summary: Text-based documents offer a wealth of information for researchers and business analysts. However, researchers often need to find a way to classify these documents to use in subsequent research projects. In this paper, we demonstrate how supervised ML methods can be used to automate the process of classifying textual documents into pre-defined categories or groups. We provide an overview of when such techniques may be used in comparison to other methods, and the considerations and tradeoffs associated with each method. We apply these methods to identify AI-based technologies from all patents in the United States, based on patent abstract text. This allows us to show interesting patterns of AI innovation development in the United States. We also provide the code and data used in this paper for future research. © 2022 The Authors.

"Objective: To determine the clinical outcomes of adult patients with single-sided deafness (SSD) undergoing ipsilateral cochlear implantation. Data Source: An electronic search of Medline and Embase articles. Review Methods: A systematic review was performed with a search strategy developed by a licensed librarian to identify studies of adult patients with SSD who underwent ipsilateral cochlear implantation. Articles were managed in Covidence and evaluated by 2 independent reviewers. Risk of bias was assessed and data were extracted, including patient demographics, etiology of deafness, duration of deafness, and postoperative change in speech recognition, tinnitus, sound localization, and quality of life (QoL). A meta-analysis was performed, and pooled mean differences were calculated for each outcome of interest via random effects models by each outcome, as well as subgroup analyses by the individual clinical score used. Results: Of 2309 studies identified, 185 full texts were evaluated, and 50 were ultimately included involving 674 patients. Speech perception scores in quiet and noise, tinnitus control, sound localization, and QoL all significantly improved after implantation. Pooled outcomes demonstrated score improvements in speech perception (standardized mean difference [SMD], 2.8 [95% CI, 2.16-3.43]), QoL (SMD, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.45-0.91]), sound localization (SMD, −1.13 [95% CI, −1.68 to −0.57]), and tinnitus score reduction (SMD, −1.32 [95% CI, −1.85 to −0.80]). Conclusions: Cochlear implantation in adults with SSD results in significant improvements in speech perception, tinnitus control, sound localization, and QoL.

"Background: Though both neurosurgeons and orthopedic spinal surgeons are keenly aware of the clinical importance of epidural fat (EF), surgical practice varies amongst individual surgeons and across both fields. Thus, an in-depth understanding of the anatomical structure and composition of EF is vital, as it will play a significant role in the therapeutic management and the surgical choice of treatment. Objective: We aim to extensively review the anatomical and biological properties of EF and further outline the surgical importance of EF management. Study Methodology: (i) MEDLINE search 1966-July 2019. Keywords: Review of the Literature. Authorship, Meta-analysis, Descriptive/Narrative overview; (ii) CINAHL search from 1982 to May 2019. Keywords: Review of the Literature spinal epidural fat; Authorship; Meta-analysis; Descriptive/Narrative overview; (iii) Hand searches of the references of retrieved literature; (iv) Personal and college libraries were searched for texts on research methods and literature reviews; and (v) 200 articles were downloaded, 50 were excluded because of similarity of topics and also because of new update on the same topics. (vi) Discussions with experts in the field of reviews of the literature. Discussion: Though excessive or reductive amounts of EF usually exacerbates neurological symptoms and lead to various pathologic conditions such as spinal epidural lipomatosis, but there is no basic science, experimental, or clinical research that proves the role of EF in the aforementioned pathologic situations. Conclusion: Anatomical illustration, biological function and properties of EF knowledge may lead to changes in the stages of the surgical approach to avoid postoperative complications. However, the role of EF is exclusively bound to a scientific hypothesis as one cannot be sure if an excessive or reductive amount in EF is entirely responsible for the pathologic findings, or just only an incidental finding. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the demand for personal protective equipment, in particular face masks, thus leading to a huge amount of healthcare waste generated worldwide. Consequently, such an unprecedented amount of newly emerged waste has posed significant challenges to practitioners, policy-makers, and municipal authorities involved in waste management (WM) systems. This research aims at mapping the COVID-19-related scientific production to date in the field of WM. In this vein, the performance indicators of the target literature were analyzed and discussed through conducting a bibliometric analysis. The conceptual structure of COVID-19-related WM research, including seven main research themes, were uncovered and visualized through a text mining analysis as follows: (1) household and food waste, (2) personnel safety and training for waste handling, (3) sustainability and circular economy, (4) personal protective equipment and plastic waste, (5) healthcare waste management practices, (6) wastewater management, and (7) COVID-19 transmission through infectious waste. Finally, a research agenda for WM practices and activities in the post-COVID-19 era was proposed, focusing on the following three identified research gaps: (i) developing a systemic framework to properly manage the pandemic crisis implications for WM practices as a whole, following a systems thinking approach, (ii) building a circular economy model encompassing all activities from the design stage to the implementation stage, and (iii) proposing incentives to effectively involve informal sectors and local capacity in decentralizing municipal waste management, with a specific focus on developing and less-developed countries. © 2022 International Association for Gondwana Research"
"Plans can only impact practice when elected officials adopt, enact, and approve funding for specific strategies. We explore ways to track implementation from the planning documents to elected officials’ priorities and to their voting patterns to identify the consistencies and gaps that may limit the impact of plans. We use Twitter data mining, text content analysis, and voting records from the digitized council minutes in Calgary, Alberta, between the 2017 municipal election and the last quarter of 2020. We connect the expressed preferences to votes for each councilor over the study period. On the two most salient topics—transit and affordable housing—those who expressed support on Twitter also supported investments. With one exception of an anti-tax councilor, over time, the rest of the councilors reached agreements on public investments (supra-local funding lightened the financial burdens for the city facilitating “yes” votes). Planners can derive meaningful information from the elected officials’ social media communication, such as concerns and support for specific planning initiatives, to promote successful plan implementation. This information can also enhance voters’ awareness of local officials’ views and actions on planning initiatives. © The Author(s) 2022."
"This study presents an innovative text mining methodology that supports policy analysts with problem recognition, definition and selection. The empirical analysis is based on four years of online news articles published in the period 2016–2019. Using a combination of text mining methods (analysis of term-frequencies, co-occurrence and sentiment analysis), we identify trending terms and explore selected regulatory issues. The analysis demonstrates that while each text mining algorithm provides insightful results, their combination yields more detailed and robust overview of regulatory problems. The results present early signals and trends, the connections between trending topics, and the changing public attitudes towards them. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"This paper investigates the role of sentiment in the US economy from 1920 to 1934 using digitised articles from The Wall Street Journal. We derive a monthly sentiment index and use a 10-variable vector error correction model to identify sentiment shocks that are orthogonal to fundamentals. We show the timing and strength of these shocks and their resultant effects on the economy using historical decompositions. Intermittent impacts of up to 15 per cent on industrial production, 10 per cent on the S&P 500 and bank loans, and 37 basis points for the credit risk spread suggest a large role for sentiment. © 2022 The Authors.

"Culture(s) and lived experience are vital considerations in meaningful learning opportunities for young children. Informational texts are used in daily life and play an important role in schooling, but they are scarcely found and used in classrooms across much of Botswana. Classroom writing experiences tend to differ greatly from children’s everyday experiences, particularly in Botswana’s public schools. The purpose of this study was to examine two genres of culturally sustaining informational texts (informative/explanatory and procedural) written by Standard 2 students in Botswana. Writing samples were collected from 22 children both before and after participation in a unit focused on authentic literacy events using culturally sustaining texts. Content analyses focused on the genre features used within the texts. Writing samples were examined individually for use of genre attributes and for any change in attributes between pre- and post-assessments. Findings indicate that children included more features specific to each genre after participating in the unit. Additionally, many students composed their texts entirely in Setswana or codemeshed using Setswana and English in the post-assessment despite the primary language of instruction being English. This exploratory study could inform practice and research related to young children’s use and creation of informational texts while attending to culture(s) and lived experience. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"As free online encyclopedias with massive volumes of content, Wikipedia and Wikidata are key to many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, such as information retrieval, knowledge base building, machine translation, text classification, and text summarization. In this paper, we introduce WikiDes, a novel dataset to generate short descriptions of Wikipedia articles for the problem of text summarization. The dataset consists of over 80k English samples on 6987 topics. We set up a two-phase summarization method — description generation (Phase I) and candidate ranking (Phase II) — as a strong approach that relies on transfer and contrastive learning. For description generation, T5 and BART show their superiority compared to other small-scale pre-trained models. By applying contrastive learning with the diverse input from beam search, the metric fusion-based ranking models outperform the direct description generation models significantly up to ≈ 22 ROUGE in topic-exclusive split and topic-independent split. Furthermore, the outcome descriptions in Phase II are supported by human evaluation in over 45.33% chosen compared to 23.66% in Phase I against the gold descriptions. In the aspect of sentiment analysis, the generated descriptions cannot effectively capture all sentiment polarities from paragraphs while doing this task better from the gold descriptions. The automatic generation of new descriptions reduces the human efforts in creating them and enriches Wikidata-based knowledge graphs. Our paper shows a practical impact on Wikipedia and Wikidata since there are thousands of missing descriptions. Finally, we expect WikiDes to be a useful dataset for related works in capturing salient information from short paragraphs.

"Background: Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a very common complication in men with diabetes mellitus (DM). Low-intensity extracorporeal shockwave therapy (Li-ESWT) offers a promising nonsurgical treatment option for ED. A systematic scoping review investigating the outcomes of Li-ESWT in diabetic men with ED has not yet been performed. Objectives: To systematically review animal and clinical studies related to the use of Li-ESWT for treatment of DM-related ED. Data sources: PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched, unrestricted by dates or study design. Materials and methods: We included qualitative studies, quantitative studies, primary research studies, meta-analyses, and research letters written in English. Full text reviewing was completed in all animal and human studies discussing Li-ESWT for the treatment of ED in subjects with DM. Data extracted included the journal citation, publication year, country of origin, study design, and a summary of the pertinent findings. Results: Our search yielded nine clinical studies and 10 animal studies. The results of the clinical studies suggest that Li-ESWT is a safe and effective treatment in men with well-controlled DM and moderate or better ED. However, the benefit is less durable in diabetic men than nondiabetic men. The results of the animal studies suggest that Li-ESWT can significantly improve erectile function in diabetic rat models with ED. Conclusions: The examined studies present encouraging results for the use of Li-ESWT to treat diabetic men with ED. Future studies, particularly robust randomized controlled trials, are necessary to confirm these findings and provide long-term follow-up. © 2022 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology."
"Small and cluttered objects are common in real-world which are challenging for detection. The difficulty is further pronounced when the objects are rotated, as traditional detectors often routinely locate the objects in horizontal bounding box such that the region of interest is contaminated with background or nearby interleaved objects. In this paper, we first innovatively introduce the idea of denoising to object detection. Instance-level denoising on the feature map is performed to enhance the detection to small and cluttered objects. To handle the rotation variation, we also add a novel IoU constant factor to the smooth L1 loss to address the long standing boundary problem, which to our analysis, is mainly caused by the periodicity of angular (PoA) and exchangeability of edges (EoE). By combing these two features, our proposed detector is termed as SCRDet++. Extensive experiments are performed on large aerial images public datasets DOTA, DIOR, UCAS-AOD as well as natural image dataset COCO, scene text dataset ICDAR2015, small traffic light dataset BSTLD and our released S $^{2}$2 TLD by this paper.

"Background: Systematic reviews to date have neglected to exclusively include studies using a validated diagnostic scale for postoperative delirium and monitoring patients for more than 24 h. Evidence on current risk factors is evolving with significantly heterogeneous study designs, inconsistent reporting of results, and a lack of adjustment for bias. Methods: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify risk factors for postoperative delirium in an adult patient population. Study designs suitable for this review included full-text articles, RCTs, observational studies, cohort studies, and case-control studies. Extracted variables from the 169 (7.4%) selected studies were included in qualitative synthesis, quantitative synthesis, and a postoperative delirium checklist. The 16 variables included in the checklist were selected based on consistency, direction of effect, number of studies, and clinical utility as a reference for future studies. Results: A total of 576 variables were extracted, but only six were eligible for meta-analysis. Age (mean difference [MD]=4.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.93–6.94; P<0.001), American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status >2 (odds ratio [OR]=2.27; 95% CI, 1.47–3.52; P<0.001), Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥2 (OR=1.9; 95% CI, 1.11–3.25; P=0.0202), and Mini-Mental State Examination (MD=–1.94; 95% CI, –3.6 to –0.27; P=0.0224) were statistically significant. Conclusions: Risk factors can assist in clinical decision-making and identification of high-risk patients. Literature analysis identified inconsistent methodology, leading to challenges in interpretation. A standardised format and evidence-based approach should guide future studies. © 2022 British Journal of Anaesthesia"
"This paper presents a two-stage parameter-free technique for the physical layout analysis of a document. In the first stage, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Expectation-Maximization (EM) is applied followed by recursive merging to obtain the best number of components from the height-frequency data. Such components are classified into running text, titles, and graphical elements. Using a Next Nearest Neighbor analysis, running-text and title text are grouped into blocks in the initial layout. At the second stage, the graphical elements are further divided into text boxes, light-colored text on a dark background, line separators, and graphics that give the final layout. Our proposed method achieved an accuracy of 86.30% and 75.14% in recognizing text and non-text elements from our generated dataset, which contains over 700 documents. Results on the ICDAR dataset show accuracy comparable to some of the best and most popular algorithms such as MHS (winner of the ICDAR-RDCL2015 competition) and PRImA’s Aletheia. The strength of our algorithm is that it is entirely free of manually tuned parameters. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Flapless and fully guided implant placement has the potential to maximize efficacy outcomes and at the same time to minimize surgical invasiveness. The aim of the current systematic review was to answer the following PICO question: “In adult human subjects undergoing dental implant placement (P), is minimally invasive flapless computer-aided fully guided (either dynamic or static computer-aided implant placement (sCAIP)) (I) superior to flapped conventional (free-handed implant placement (FHIP) or cast-based/drill partially guided implant placement (dPGIP)) surgery (C), in terms of efficacy, patient morbidity, long-term prognosis, and costs (O)?” Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) fulfilling specific inclusion criteria established to answer the PICO question were included. Two review authors independently searched for eligible studies, screened the titles and abstracts, performed full-text analysis, extracted the data from the published reports, and performed the risk of bias assessment. In cases of disagreement, a third review author took the final decision during ad hoc consensus meetings. The study results were summarized using random effects meta-analyses, which were based (wherever possible) on individual patient data (IPD). A total of 10 manuscripts reporting on five RCTs, involving a total of 124 participants and 449 implants, and comparing flapless sCAIP with flapped FHIP/cast-based partially guided implant placement (cPGIP), were included. There was no RCT analyzing flapless dynamic computer-aided implant placement (dCAIP) or flapped dPGIP. Intergroup meta-analyses indicated less depth deviation (difference in means (MD) = −0.28 mm; 95% confidence interval (CI): −0.59 to 0.03; moderate certainty), angular deviation (MD = −3.88 degrees; 95% CI: −7.00 to −0.77; high certainty), coronal (MD = −0.6 mm; 95% CI: −1.21 to 0.01; low certainty) and apical (MD = −0.75 mm; 95% CI: −1.43 to −0.07; moderate certainty) three-dimensional bodily deviations, postoperative pain (MD = −17.09 mm on the visual analogue scale (VAS); 95% CI: −33.38 to −0.80; low certainty), postoperative swelling (MD = −6.59 mm on the VAS; 95% CI: −19.03 to 5.85; very low certainty), intraoperative discomfort (MD = −9.36 mm on the VAS; 95% CI: −17.10 to −1.61) and surgery duration (MD = −24.28 minutes; 95% CI: −28.62 to −19.95) in flapless sCAIP than in flapped FHIP/cPGIP. Despite being more accurate than flapped FHIP/cPGIP, flapless sCAIP still resulted in deviations with respect to the planned position (intragroup meta-analytic means: 0.76 mm in depth, 2.57 degrees in angular, 1.43 mm in coronal, and 1.68 in apical three-dimensional bodily position). Moreover, flapless sCAIP presented a 12% group-specific intraoperative complication rate, resulting in an inability to place the implant with this protocol in 7% of cases. Evidence regarding more clinically relevant outcomes of efficacy (implant survival and success, prosthetically and biologically correct positioning), long-term prognosis, and costs, is currently scarce. When the objective is to guarantee minimal invasiveness at implant placement, clinicians could consider the use of flapless sCAIP. A proper case selection and consideration of a safety margin are, however, suggested. © 2022 The Authors. Periodontology 2000 published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Background: In the digital environment, users' academic reading behaviour has changed, working with many articles simultaneously to search, filter, scan, link, annotate and analyse content fragments. The semantic enhancement environment has been widely set with semantic technologies to offer additional and handy support for users and thus facilitate the reading process. Despite many efforts devoted to developing a semantic enhancement environment, less attention has been paid to its actual effects. Objectives: This study aims to explore the effects of a semantic enhancement environment. Methods: Elaborating on cognitive load theory and focusing on academic reading, this study compared users' cognitive load and reading effect under the semantic enhancement environment and plain text environment and verified the three hypotheses. Results and conclusions: Through experiments and statistical analysis, this study found that, under a semantic enhancement environment, users had their cognitive load reduced and their reading effect improved. Consequently, a semantic enhancement environment promotes academic reading. Takeaways: This study adds to previous literature on semantic publishing by empirically corroborating the conducive effects of semantic enhancement environment in academic reading. Additionally, it justifies semantic publishing and provides a reference for the future design of semantically enhanced reading environments. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"Cross-modal retrieval tasks, which are more natural and challenging than traditional retrieval tasks, have attracted increasing interest from researchers in recent years. Although different modalities with the same semantics have some potential relevance, the feature space heterogeneity still seriously weakens the performance of cross-modal retrieval models. To solve this problem, common space-based methods in which multimodal data is projected into a learned common space for similarity measurement have become the mainstream approach for cross-modal retrieval tasks. However, current methods entangle the modality style and semantic content in the common space and neglect to fully explore the semantic and discriminative representation/reconstruction of the semantic content. This often results in an unsatisfactory retrieval performance. To solve these issues, this paper proposes a new Deep Supervised Dual Cycle Adversarial Network (DSDCAN) model based on common space learning. It is composed of two cross-modal cycle GANs, one for the image and one for the text. The proposed cycle GAN model disentangles the semantic content and modality style features by making the data of one modality well reconstructed from the extracted modal style feature and the content feature of the other modality. Then, a discriminative semantic and label loss is proposed by fully considering the category, sample contrast, and label supervision to enhance the semantic discrimination of the common space representation. Besides this, to make the data distribution between two modalities similar, a second-order similarity is presented as a distance measurement of the cross-modal representation in the common space. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the Wikipedia, Pascal Sentence, NUS-WIDE-10k, PKU XMedia, MSCOCO, NUS-WIDE, Flickr30k and MIRFlickr datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a higher performance than the state-of-the-art methods.  © 1991-2012 IEEE."
"Purpose: Tinnitus is a common symptom with multiple causes and treatment options. Previous studies have investigated the effect of lidocaine iontophoresis. The aim of this review is to systematically present the effects on tinnitus and to derive possible effects. Methods: In accordance to the PRISMA statement, the search and analysis were performed. An abstract in German or English and a performed intervention with lidocaine iontophoresis for the treatment of tinnitus, independent of the study design, were considered as inclusion criteria. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, only a narrative synthesis was performed. Results: The search yielded 179 studies of which 170 were excluded. Six full-texts and three abstracts were included. In total, 957 patients were treated with lidocaine iontophoresis. The percent improvement in symptoms after lidocaine iontophoresis ranged from 4% to 62%. The qualitative assessment of the studies resulted in an overall “weak” rating for all of them. Conclusions: Due to the heterogeneity and the limited quality of the studies found, no clear statement can be made about the efficacy. The number of those who benefited from therapy varied widely. In addition, it cannot be ruled out that the effect was merely due to electrical stimulation of the cochlea. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Since radiology reports needed for clinical practice and research are written and stored in free-text narrations, extraction of relative information for further analysis is difficult. In these circumstances, natural language processing (NLP) techniques can facilitate automatic information extraction and transformation of free-text formats to structured data. In recent years, deep learning (DL)-based models have been adapted for NLP experiments with promising results. Despite the significant potential of DL models based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN), the models face some limitations to implement in clinical practice. Transformers, another new DL architecture, have been increasingly applied to improve the process. Therefore, in this study, we propose a transformer-based fine-grained named entity recognition (NER) architecture for clinical information extraction. We collected 88 abdominopelvic sonography reports in free-text formats and annotated them based on our developed information schema. The text-to-text transfer transformer model (T5) and Scifive, a pre-trained domain-specific adaptation of the T5 model, were applied for fine-tuning to extract entities and relations and transform the input into a structured format. Our transformer-based model in this study outperformed previously applied approaches such as ANN and CNN models based on ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2, ROUGE-L, and BLEU scores of 0.816, 0.668, 0.528, and 0.743, respectively, while providing an interpretable structured report. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Society for Imaging Informatics in Medicine."
"Changes in human lifestyle have led to an increase in the number of people suffering from depression over the past century. Although in recent years, rates of diagnosing mental illness have improved, many cases remain undetected. Automated detection methods can help identify depressed or individuals at risk. An understanding of depression detection requires effective feature representation and analysis of language use. In this article, text classifiers are trained for depression detection. The key objective is to improve depression detection performance by examining and comparing two sets of methods: hybrid and ensemble. The results show that ensemble models outperform the hybrid model classification results. The strength and effectiveness of the combined features demonstrate that better performance can be achieved by multiple feature combinations and proper feature selection.  © 2014 IEEE."
"Deep product quantization networks (DPQNs) have been successfully used in image retrieval tasks, due to their powerful feature extraction ability and high efficiency of encoding high-dimensional visual features. Recent studies show that deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to input with small and maliciously designed perturbations (a.k.a., adversarial examples) for classification. However, little effort has been devoted to investigating how adversarial examples affect DPQNs, which raises the potential safety hazard when deploying DPQNs in a commercial search engine. To this end, we propose an adversarial example generation framework by generating adversarial query images for DPQN-based retrieval systems. Unlike the adversarial generation for the classic image classification task that heavily relies on ground-truth labels, we alternatively perturb the probability distribution of centroids assignments for a clean query, then we can induce effective non-targeted attacks on DPQNs in white-box and black-box settings. Moreover, we further extend the non-targeted attack to a targeted attack by a novel sample space averaging scheme ($\text{S}^{2}$S2AS), whose theoretical guarantee is also obtained. Extensive experiments show that our methods can create adversarial examples to successfully mislead the target DPQNs. Besides, we found that our methods both significantly degrade the retrieval performance under a wide variety of experimental settings.

"Introduction and objectives: To determine the dose-response association between current and past leisure-time physical activity (LTPA), total and at different intensities, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) functionality parameters. Methods: Study participants (n = 642) were randomly drawn from a large population-based survey. Mean age of the participants was 63.2 years and 51.1% were women. The analysis included data from a baseline and a follow-up visit (median follow-up, 4 years). LTPA was assessed using validated questionnaires at both visits. Two main HDL functions were assessed: cholesterol efflux capacity and HDL antioxidant capacity, at the follow-up visit. Linear regression and linear additive models were used to assess the linear and nonlinear association between LTPA and HDL functionality. Results: Total LTPA at follow-up showed an inverse and linear relationship between 0 and 400 METs x min/d with HDL antioxidant capacity (regression coefficient [beta]: −0.022; 95%CI, −0.030, −0.013), with a plateau above this threshold. The results were similar for moderate (beta: −0.028; 95%CI, −0.049, −0.007) and vigorous (beta: −0.025; 95%CI, −0.043, −0.007), but not for light-intensity LTPA. LTPA at follow-up was not associated with cholesterol efflux capacity. Baseline LTPA was not associated with any of the HDL functionality parameters analyzed. Conclusions: Current moderate and vigorous LTPA showed a nonlinear association with higher HDL antioxidant capacity. Maximal benefit was observed with low-intermediate doses of total LTPA (up to 400 METs x min/d). Our results agree with current recommendations for moderate-vigorous LTPA practice and suggest an association between PA and HDL functionality in the general population.

"By focussing on Imma – a virtual influencer from Japan – this article provides a critical examination of Japanese raciality and gender within the context of virtuality, (im)materiality and digital consumption. This piece has two key concerns. Firstly, the article proposes the idea of semiotic immaterialism as a way to theorise the ‘virtual influencer’, a relatively new phenomenon in ‘the West’ to emerge from the consumer-driven world of social media and online influencers. Here, the discussion will focus predominantly on the various racialised and gendered (im)materialities involved in the digital consumption of virtuality, and its relationship to prosumerist practices online. Secondly, this study also problematises the ways in which ‘Western’ popular media texts present Japanese virtuality to consumers. It is argued that these constitute digital-Orientalist discourses of racialised and gendered Japanese Otherness. How does virtuality complicate the idea of (im)material consumption? How do virtual influencers challenge and/or reinforce normative ideologies of race and gender? Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the study addresses these questions through textual analyses conducted on Imma’s Instagram images and captions, alongside ‘Western’ popular media texts about Imma. Ultimately, it is argued that Imma, as a virtual influencer, represents how the (im)materiality of Japanese race and gender is materialised through the digital- and self-Orientalist commodification of Japanese virtuality. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Social network events are related to the national economy and people's livelihood, so timely perception and processing of massive social network events data are becoming increasingly important for public opinion analysis. How to fully exploit the access feature of event information to store and manage social network events is of great significance for accurate and real-time query analysis. We propose a social network event storage management method based on microblog text clustering and hot/cold data classification. First, for the microblog text data, we construct a keyword provenance graph by using the information entropy to measure the weight of the edge between keyword nodes. Then, we cluster the events using the provenance-based community partition (PCP) with local modularity to improve the event clustering accuracy. In addition, we can further filter noisy data via incremental clustering, enable hot/cold event data classification and dynamic migration, and compress cold data to save space on a hybrid storage architecture. The experimental results show that the clustering purity can reach more than 93% and the query time can be reduced by more than 70% using clustering and hybrid storage policy.  © 2014 IEEE."
"This paper suggests novel proposed cancellable biometric realization technique recognition and template protection. This algorithm is based on encrypt data securely with the benefits of graph theory properties. The new symmetric encryption algorithm utilizes the concepts of bipartite graph to generate a complex cipher text using a shared key. In this paper, the Graph First Decomposition Mask (GFH) encoding algorithm is utilized for cancelable face system. In the suggested scheme, the GFH algorithm is applied on the face images. The resultant map is encrypted, in order to the second GFH utilized in production from the picture. This scheme can be used to develop a frequency domain procedure for making this system for biometric template protection. Simulation results using evaluation metrics False Positive Rate (FPR), False Negative Rate (FNR), Equal Error Rate (EER), Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and Area under ROC (AROC) prove that the proposed cancelable biometric technique is the best performance with comparing the other techniques.The obtained results clear that the suggested technique has sucesseded in cancelable face biometric. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Scene text recognition is an indispensable part of computer vision, which aims to extract text information from an image. However, effective extraction of texts following spelling rules remains a challenge for scene text recognition. We propose a cross-domain Transformer, called STR Transformer (STRT), which can not only extract texts from an image but also correct characters effectively according to their spelling rules. Specifically, we propose a Spline Transformer to extract hierarchical features of images without the convolution layers, which has the flexibility to build models with various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. Furthermore, an iterative Text Transformer is designed to predict the probability distribution of current character in the character sequence, which can effectively reduce the impact of noise. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed STRT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark datasets of scene text recognition. The qualitative and quantitative analysis proves the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed STRT method. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Objective: Identifying digital markers of sleep disturbance—a known suicide risk factor—may aid in the detection of imminent suicide risk. This study examined sleep-related communication and texting patterns in personal text messages (N = 86,705) of suicide attempt survivors. Method: Twenty-six participants provided dates of past suicide attempts and 2-week periods of positive mood, depressed mood, or suicidal ideation. Linguistic Inquiry Word Count was used to identify sleep-related texts via a custom dictionary. Mixed effect models were fitted to test the association between suicide/mood episode type (e.g., attempt versus ideation) and three outcomes: likelihood of a text including sleep-related content, nightly count of texts sent from midnight to 5:00 AM, and sum of unique hour bins from midnight to 5:00 AM with outgoing texts. Results: Analyses with a sleep dictionary that was manually revised to be more accurate (but not the original unedited dictionary) showed sleep-related communication was more likely during depressed mood episodes than positive mood episodes. Otherwise, there were no significant differences in sleep-related communication or objective texting patterns across episode type. Conclusions: Although we did not detect differences in sleep-related communication tied to suicidal thoughts or behaviors, sleep-related communication may differ as a function of within-person mood level. © 2022 The Authors.

"Introduction and objectives: The role of emergency coronary angiography (CAG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in patients without ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) remains unclear. We aimed to assess whether emergency CAG and PCI would improve survival with good neurological outcome in this population. Methods: In this multicenter, randomized, open-label, investigator-initiated clinical trial, we randomly assigned 69 survivors of OHCA without STEMI to undergo immediate CAG or deferred CAG. The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of in-hospital survival free of severe dependence. The safety endpoint was a composite of major adverse cardiac events including death, reinfarction, bleeding, and ventricular arrhythmias. Results: A total of 66 patients were included in the primary analysis (95.7%). In-hospital survival was 62.5% in the immediate CAG group and 58.8% in the delayed CAG group (HR, 0.96; 95%CI, 0.45-2.09; P = .93). In-hospital survival free of severe dependence was 59.4% in the immediate CAG group and 52.9% in the delayed CAG group (HR, 1.29; 95%CI, 0.60-2.73; P = .4986). No differences were found in the secondary endpoints except for the incidence of acute kidney failure, which was more frequent in the immediate CAG group (15.6% vs 0%, P = .002) and infections, which were higher in the delayed CAG group (46.9% vs 73.5%, P = .003). Conclusions: In this underpowered randomized trial involving patients resuscitated after OHCA without STEMI, immediate CAG provided no benefit in terms of survival without neurological impairment compared with delayed CAG.

"Background: Troubled conscience among nurses and other healthcare workers represents a significant contributor to healthcare worker moral distress, burnout and attrition. While research in this area has examined critical care in hospitals, less knowledge has been obtained from long-term care contexts such as nursing homes, despite widely recognised challenges with regard to vulnerable patients, increasing workload and maintaining workforce sustainability among nurses. Objective: The aim of this study was to illuminate and interpret the meaning of the lived experience of troubled conscience among registered nurses (RNs) working in nursing homes. Research design: This qualitative research employed narrative interviews with eight nurses to obtain essential meanings of their lived experiences of troubled conscience. The interview texts were analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach. Ethical considerations: Participation was voluntary, informed and was conducted with written consent. The Norwegian Centre for Research Data approved the data processing of personal data. Findings: The analysis uncovered two themes: (1) troubled conscience means abandoning ideals, with the subthemes: failing dependent patients; being disloyal to colleagues; being inadequate in the performance of work tasks and (2) troubled conscience means facing realities, with the subthemes: accepting being part of the system; responding to barriers. Discussion: Troubled conscience meant experiencing continuous and simmering tension between one’s ideals and realities and feeling a drive to preserve accountability and one’s moral integrity. Endangered ideals were often under cross-pressure and included humanistic values, professional values, working life values and the values of the organisation. Conclusion: Nurses’ troubled conscience refers to a struggle, but also a force that plays out at various levels and arenas in long-term care. Openness and dialogue about how professional values and the welfare state’s intentions can be realised within the given framework are important for individual nurses’ occupational health as well as the quality of care provided to patients. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Background: Postoperative delirium (POD) is the most common serious postoperative complication in older adults. It has uncertain aetiology, limited preventative strategies, and poor long-term outcomes. This updated systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the effect of processed electroencephalography (pEEG)-guided general anaesthesia during surgery on POD incidence. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis by searching OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) electronic databases. Studies of adult patients having general anaesthesia for any surgery where pEEG was used and POD was an outcome measure were included. Full-text reports of RCTs published from database inception until August 28, 2021, were included. Trials were excluded if sedation rather than general anaesthesia was administered, or the setting was intensive care. The primary outcome was POD assessed by validated tools. The study was prospectively registered with PROSPERO. Results: Nine studies, which included 4648 eligible subjects, were identified. The incidence of POD in the pEEG-guided general anaesthesia or lighter pEEG target group was 19.0% (440/2310) compared with 23.3% (545/2338) in the usual care or deeper pEEG target group (pooled odds ratio=0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.60–1.00; P=0.054). Significant heterogeneity was detected (I2=53%). Conclusions: Our primary analysis demonstrated a highly sensitive result with a pooled analysis of trials in which the intervention group adhered to manufacturer's recommended guidelines, showing reduced incidence of POD with pEEG guidance. High clinical heterogeneity limits inferences from this and any future meta-analyses. Clinical trial registration: CRD42020199404 (PROSPERO). © 2022 British Journal of Anaesthesia"
"Deep learning (DL) models for natural language processing (NLP) tasks often handle private data, demanding protection against breaches and disclosures. Data protection laws, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), thereby enforce the need for privacy. Although many privacy-preserving NLP methods have been proposed in recent years, no categories to organize them have been introduced yet, making it hard to follow the progress of the literature. To close this gap, this article systematically reviews over sixty DL methods for privacy-preserving NLP published between 2016 and 2020, covering theoretical foundations, privacy-enhancing technologies, and analysis of their suitability for real-world scenarios. First, we introduce a novel taxonomy for classifying the existing methods into three categories: data safeguarding methods, trusted methods, and verification methods. Second, we present an extensive summary of privacy threats, datasets for applications, and metrics for privacy evaluation. Third, throughout the review, we describe privacy issues in the NLP pipeline in a holistic view. Further, we discuss open challenges in privacy-preserving NLP regarding data traceability, computation overhead, dataset size, the prevalence of human biases in embeddings, and the privacy-utility tradeoff. Finally, this review presents future research directions to guide successive research and development of privacy-preserving NLP models. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"A trusted execution environment (TEE) is a system-on-chip and CPU system with a wide security solution available on today's Arm application (APP) processors, which dominate the smartphone market. Generally, mobile APPs create a trusted application (TA) in the TEE to process sensitive information, such as payment or message encryption, which is transparent to the APPs running in the rich execution environments (REEs). In detail, the REE and TEE interact and eventually send back the results to the APP in the REE through the interface provided by the TA. Such an operation definitely increases the overhead of mobile APPs. In this paper, we first present a comprehensive analysis of the performance of open-source TEE encrypted text. We then propose a high energy-efficient task scheduling strategy (ETS-TEE). By leveraging the deep learning algorithm, our policy considers the complexity of TA tasks, which are dynamically scheduled between modeling on the local device and offloading to an edge server. We evaluate our approach on Raspberry Pi 3B as the local mobile device and Jetson TX2 as the edge server. The results show that compared with the default scheduling strategy on the local device, our approach achieves an average of 38.0% energy reduction and 1.6 × speedup. This greatly reduces the performance loss caused by mobile devices in order to protect the safe execution of applications, so that the trusted execution environment has both security and high performance.  © 1996-2012 Tsinghua University Press."
"Learning predictive models in new domains with scarce training data is a growing challenge in modern supervised learning scenarios. This incentivizes developing domain adaptation methods that leverage the knowledge in known domains (source) and adapt to new domains (target) with a different probability distribution. This becomes more challenging when the source and target domains are in heterogeneous feature spaces, known as heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA). While most HDA methods utilize mathematical optimization to map source and target data to a common space, they suffer from low transferability. Neural representations have proven to be more transferable; however, they are mainly designed for homogeneous environments. Drawing on the theory of domain adaptation, we propose a novel framework, Heterogeneous Adversarial Neural Domain Adaptation (HANDA), to effectively maximize the transferability in heterogeneous environments. HANDA conducts feature and distribution alignment in a unified neural network architecture and achieves domain invariance through adversarial kernel learning. Three experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance against the state-of-the-art HDA methods on major image and text e-commerce benchmarks. HANDA shows statistically significant improvement in predictive performance. The practical utility of HANDA was shown in real-world dark web online markets. HANDA is an important step towards successful domain adaptation in e-commerce applications.  © 1979-2012 IEEE."
"Introduction and hypothesis: Articles are getting published on the use of tissue adhesive for vesicovaginal fistula. The objective is to carry out a systematic review on their effectiveness and complications. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Two reviewers screened abstracts and full-text and extracted data independently. A narrative synthesis was conducted given the heterogeneity of studies. Results: A total of 1032 studies were identified after searching the database, and 14 articles were included in this systematic review. Of the 84 women included, 12 (14.3%) presented failure or recurrence of their fistula tract. The mean time of follow-up was 11.46 months. The average size of the fistula was 1.05 (range 0.1 to 3.9) cm. Most fistulas (81) included were vesicovaginal fistulas. Nine papers reported the usage of fibrin glue in which only three (6.5%) women reported recurrence of the fistula in a delay of 2 weeks to 26 months. The other studies used cyanoacrylate (14 women) and autologous fibrin injection from the patients’ blood (31 women). No significant complications were reported. Complications reported were urinary tract infections in 3 women (3.6%), hematuria in 2 women (2.4%), overactive bladder symptoms in 6 women (7.2%) and septic pelvic thrombosis in one woman (1.2%). Conclusions: Tissue adhesive appears to be a promising alternative for management of urogenital fistulas without reported important complications. © 2022, The International Urogynecological Association."
"Mind wandering (MW), a shift of attention away from external tasks toward internally generated thoughts, has been frequently associated with costs in reading comprehension (RC), although with some contrasting results and many reported potential intervening factors. The aim of the meta-analysis was to evaluate the relationship between MW and RC, considering the role of participants’ and text’s characteristics, as well as methodological issues in the measurement of the two constructs. From a set of 25 selected full texts (73 correlation coefficients), pooled correlation (r = −0.21) revealed a negative significant relationship. Using trait-based questionnaires to assess MW compared with online probes resulted in an average significant change of 0.30 in the correlation between MW and RC, leading to a null correlation. A significant effect of age was also found, with more negative correlations with increasing age. None of the other moderating variables considered (i.e., language, text type, text length, RC assessment, text difficulty, text interest, and working memory) resulted in a significant effect. From the present meta-analysis, we might suggest that MW and RC are partially overlapping and vary, within a swing effect, in relation to a set of shared factors, such as working memory, interest, and text length. There might also be side-specific factors that drive the movement of primarily one side of the swing, and future research should further consider the role of individual differences in RC. Implications for research and educational settings are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Software knowledge community contains a large scale of software knowledge entity information, complex structure and rich semantic correlations. It is significant to recognize and extract software knowledge entity from software knowledge community, as it has great impact on entity-centric tasks such as software knowledge graph construction, software document generation and expert recommendation. Since the texts of the software knowledge community are unstructured by user-generated texts, it is difficult to apply the traditional entity extraction method in the domain of the software knowledge community due to the problems of entity variation, entity sparsity, entity ambiguity, out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words and the lack of annotated data sets. This paper proposes a novel software knowledge entity extraction model, named AttenSy-SNER, which integrates syntactic features and semantic augmentation information, to extract fine-grained software knowledge entities from unstructured user-generated content. The input representation layer utilizes Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) model to extract the feature representation of the input sequence. The contextual coding layer leverages the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for contextual information and syntactic dependency information, and a semantic augmentation strategy based on attention mechanism is introduced to enrich the semantic feature representation of sequences as well. The tag decoding layer leverages Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to solve the dependency between the output tags and obtain the global optimal label sequence. The results of model comparison experiments show that the proposed model has better performance than the benchmark model in software engineering domain. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"While stylistics has successfully integrated the study of language use in film and television, relatively little research has tried to systematically classify the functions of television or film dialogue – i.e. to taxonomise its range of potential stylistic functions such as characterisation or the creation of consistency. Most stylistic research has also focussed on traditional US (Hollywood) or European narrative mass media, rather than culturally-diverse or Indigenous-authored film and television. This article aims to make a contribution to both of these under-examined fields by offering a case study of the stylistic functions of Australian Aboriginal English lexis in three successful Indigenous-authored television series. The three series (Redfern Now, Cleverman and Mystery Road) are all important for the television canon and were broadcast in Australia as well as exported internationally. Using an existing corpus with dialogue from these series as repository, this article illustrates the different functions of Australian Aboriginal English lexis in its surrounding text by critically examining multiple dialogue extracts from the three narratives. Quotations from Indigenous screen creatives are interwoven with the analysis where relevant. We argue that such lexis fulfils many functions beyond characterisation and demonstrate the significance of communicating culture and identity in Indigenous-authored drama. The study has implications both for the stylistic analysis of the multiple functions of television/film dialogue and for the study of narratives that feature significant creative involvement by marginalised, subjugated, colonised, or otherwise historically excluded communities – including but not limited to Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait islander people(s) in Australia. © The Author(s) 2022."
"The history of science has a unique value to teaching, and textbooks play an important role in permeating the history of science in science courses. This study aims to compare the presentation of history of science in two versions of high school physics textbooks in China. We selected the 2019 edition of the national and local textbooks as samples. The revised Leite’s checklist is used to conduct statistics and comparative analysis on the history of science content in the two versions of textbooks, referred to as the PEP and Luke versions described in more detail in the paper. The results show that, in terms of the quantity and presentation of the history of science, the PEP version contains more history of science, while the Luke version presents the historical content more intuitively. In terms of the type and organization of the history of science, the Luke version describes scientists and the type of evolution in more detail. In the presentation of the history of science, both of the two versions of textbooks are mainly based on texts written by textbook authors, supplemented by pictures of scientists and instruments. In the description of the contexts of the history of science, both tend to use the scientific context to present the history of science. In terms of the status of the history of science content, it mostly acts as a fundamental role in the Luke version while plays a complementary one in the PEP version. As for the learning activities related to the history of science, both tend to set up normal-level activities. The two versions of textbooks are relatively poor in the internal consistency of the textbooks with respect to the historical information and interdisciplinary activity design. Only Compulsory Book 1 of PEP version has the content of history of science as bibliography, and both of the two versions of textbooks seldom have history of science books as its bibliography. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are commonly used to evaluate the impact of a health condition on quality of life (QOL). This study aimed to identify the range of PROMs that are currently in common use in clinical trials in dysphagia following stroke and to qualitatively analyse these PROMs by mapping the content to both the International Classification of Functioning and Disability Framework (ICF) and the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) Taxonomy for outcome classification. With consideration for the PRISMA-ScR checklist, a scoping review was conducted to identify commonly used PROMs in randomised controlled trials reported in persons with dysphagia stroke. A search of five databases was conducted. Studies were excluded if they included pediatric participants i.e. < 18 years of age, or if the text was not available in the English language. 110 papers met the inclusionary criteria. Twelve of these 110 papers included a dysphagia PROM. Two PROMs were identified as being in common use—the SWAL-QOL and the EAT-10. These two tools consisted of 47 items and 78 meaningful concepts, which were subsequently mapped to the ICF and the COMET Taxonomy. Mapping to the ICF showed that neither tool directly assessed the impact of ‘Environmental Factors’ on the experience of dysphagia. Mapping to the COMET Taxonomy showed that neither tool considered the impact of ‘Role Functioning’ on the person’s experience of dysphagia. The development of a suitable and appropriate patient-reported assessment tool for use in those with dysphagia following stroke is warranted. © 2022, Crown."
"Due to the recent advances in natural language processing, social scientists use automatic text classification methods more and more frequently. The article raises the question about how researchers’ subjective decisions affect the performance of supervised deep learning models. The aim is to deliver practical advice for researchers concerning: (1) whether it is more efficient to monitor coders’ work to ensure a high quality training dataset or have every document coded once and obtain a larger dataset instead; (2) whether lemmatisation improves model performance; (3) if it is better to apply passive learning or active learning approaches; and (4) if the answers are dependent on the models’ classification tasks. The models were trained to detect if a tweet is about current affairs or political issues, the tweet’s subject matter and the tweet author’s stance on this. The study uses a sample of 200,000 manually coded tweets published by Polish political opinion leaders in 2019. The consequences of decisions under different conditions were checked by simulating 52,800 results using the fastText algorithm (DV: F1-score). Linear regression analysis suggests that the researchers’ choices not only strongly affect model performance but may also lead, in the worst-case scenario, to a waste of funds. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"Background: Physicians and nurses face high levels of burnout. The role of care teams may be protective against burnout and provide a potential target for future interventions. Objective: To explore levels of burnout among physicians and nurses and differences in burnout between physicians and nurses, to understand physician and nurse perspectives of their healthcare teams, and to explore the association of the role of care teams and burnout. Design: A mixed methods study in two school of medicine affiliated teaching hospitals in an urban medical center in Baltimore, Maryland. Participants: Participants included 724 physicians and 971 nurses providing direct clinical care to patients. Main Measures and Approach: Measures included survey participant characteristics, a single-item burnout measure, and survey questions on care teams and provision of clinical care. Thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative survey responses from physicians and nurses. Key Results: Forty-three percent of physicians and nurses screened positive for burnout. Physicians reported more isolation at work than nurses (p<0.001), and nurses reported their care teams worked efficiently together more than physicians did (p<0.001). Team efficiency was associated with decreased likelihood of burnout (p<0.01), and isolation at work was associated with increased likelihood of burnout (p<0.001). Free-text responses revealed themes related to care teams, including emphasis on team functioning, team membership, and care coordination and follow-up. Respondents provided recommendations about optimizing care teams including creating consistent care teams, expanding interdisciplinary team members, and increasing clinical support staffing. Conclusions: More team efficiency and less isolation at work were associated with decreased likelihood of burnout. Free-text responses emphasized viewpoints on care teams, suggesting that better understanding care teams may provide insight into physician and nurse burnout. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of General Internal Medicine."
"Nowadays, we are witnessing a paradigm shift from the conventional approach of working from office spaces to the emerging culture of working virtually from home. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, many organisations were forced to allow employees to work from their homes, which led to worldwide discussions of this trend on Twitter. The analysis of this data has immense potential to change the way we work but extracting useful information from this valuable data is a challenge. Hence in this study, the microblogging website Twitter is used to gather more than 450,000 English language tweets from 22nd January 2022 to 12th March 2022, consisting of keywords related to working from home. A state-of-the-art pre-processing technique is used to convert all emojis into text, remove duplicate tweets, retweets, username tags, URLs, hashtags etc. and then the text is converted to lowercase. Thus, the number of tweets is reduced to 358,823. In this paper, we propose a fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyse Twitter data. The input to our deep learning model is an annotated set of tweets that are effectively labelled into three sentiment classes, viz. positive negative and neutral using VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning). We also use a variation in the input vector to the embedding layer, by using FastText embeddings with our model to train supervised word representations for our text corpus of more than 450,000 tweets. The proposed model uses multiple convolution and max pooling layers, dropout operation, and dense layers with ReLU and sigmoid activations to achieve remarkable results on our dataset. Further, the performance of our model is compared with some standard classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. From the results, it is observed that on the given dataset, the proposed CNN with FastText word embeddings outperforms other classifiers with an accuracy of 0.925969. As a result of this classification, 54.41% of the tweets are found to show affirmation, 24.50% show a negative disposition, and 21.09% have neutral sentiments towards working from home. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Cloud technology is a modern data storing technique that gives opportunities for outsourcing of storage and computation. While storing sensitive data (such as medical records) at the cloud side can violate personal privacy, Homomorphic Encryption (HE) was presented as a special type of encryption that leverages users’ privacy by allowing computation over cipher-texts at the cloud side. In our prior work, we developed and tested a new additive HE scheme (SAVHO) that has been proven to be a good competitor for the Paillier scheme. The aim of this paper is to build a new secure and efficient multiplicative HE scheme competitor for the well-known multiplicative HE scheme ElGamal. The proposed scheme is called Logarithm Operation for Randomization and Multiplicative Homomorphic Encryption scheme (LORMHE). Security and performance analyses have proven its high level of security and its efficiency in comparison with ElGamal scheme and its efficiency for real world applications. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to predict sentiment polarities of given aspects in text. Most current approaches employ attention-based neural methods to capture semantic relationships between aspects and words in one sentence. However, these methods ignore the fact that sentences with the same aspect and sentiment polarity often share the structure and semantic information in a domain, which leads to lower model performance. To mitigate this problem, we propose a heterogeneous aspect graph neural network (HAGNN) to learn the structure and semantic knowledge from intersentence relationships. Our model is a heterogeneous graph neural network since it contains three different kinds of nodes: word nodes, aspect nodes, and sentence nodes. These nodes can pass structure and semantic information between each other and update their embeddings to improve the performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use a heterogeneous graph to capture relationships between sentences and aspects. The experimental results on five public datasets show the effectiveness of our model outperforming some state-of-the-art models.  © 2014 IEEE."
"Free text answers to short questions can reflect students' mastery of concepts and their relationships relevant to learning objectives. However, automating the assessment of free text answers has been challenging due to the complexity of natural language. Existing studies often predict the scores of free text answers in a 'black box' manner without analyzing their semantic components, which at least partially limit the prediction performance. In this article, we focus on fine-grained semantic facets in free text answers that correspond to knowledge to be mastered. Using a dataset with semantic facet annotation, we first show the correspondence of semantic facet matching states and answer quality, as well as the importance of semantic facets in automatic assessment of answer quality. We then extend the work to a dataset without semantic facet annotation and demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed automated methods in assessing answer quality, including semantic facet extraction, matching state prediction based on a neural framework, and feature engineering with semantic facets. The contribution of this research is twofold: 1) the proposed methods improve state-of-the-art performance of automatic assessment of free text answers and 2) it delves into fine-grained semantic components of free text answers, making it possible to explain the scores and generate detailed feedback. © 2008-2011 IEEE."
"The academic literature of social sciences records human civilization and studies human social problems. With its large-scale growth, the ways to quickly find existing research on relevant issues have become an urgent demand for researchers. Previous studies, such as SciBERT, have shown that pre-training using domain-specific texts can improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. However, the pre-trained language model for social sciences is not available so far. In light of this, the present research proposes a pre-trained model based on the abstracts published in the Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) journals. The models, which are available on GitHub (https://github.com/S-T-Full-Text-Knowledge-Mining/SSCI-BERT), show excellent performance on discipline classification, abstract structure–function recognition, and named entity recognition tasks with the social sciences literature. © 2022, Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest, Hungary."
"Digital technology and literacy can heighten the transformation of teaching and learning in higher education institutions (HEIs). This study uncovers the extent to which digital technologies have been used to advance the teaching and learning process in HEIs, and the barriers and bottlenecks to why it may not have been effectively implemented across the HEIs. The study used nine selected countries in Latin America (LATAM) based on the main focus of the educators, commercial, and financial investors; to show the level of impact/implications of computer technologies on the teaching and learning processes. We applied a two-step (mixed) methodology (through a quantitative and qualitative lens) for the research investigation, using data collected from survey we administered to faculty members in HEIs across the different countries in LATAM. In turn, we implemented a Text Mining technique (sentiment and emotional valence analysis) to analyze opinions (textual data) given by the participants to help determine challenges and obstacles to using the digital technologies for teaching and learning in the region. Quantitatively, we applied a Kruskal–Wallis H-test to analyze the collected multiple choice and ranked items in the questionnaire in order to identify prominent factors that consummately influence the reach, barriers, and bottlenecks, and where the differences may lie across the different LATAM countries. The results show that the users upheld the emphasis on lack of training, infrastructures and resources, access to internet and digital platforms, as the main challenges to the teaching–learning process. The study also empirically discussed and shed light on critical factors the HEIs, particularly in LATAM, should resolve and adopt in support of the decision-making strategies, operational policies and governance, financial investments, and policymaking, at a time when “digital technologies” have become an inevitable and indispensable part of education and learning. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Novel warnings on individual cigarettes represent a potentially effective means for reducing tobacco use. This study evaluated perceptions of Australians towards health warnings on cigarettes. Participants rated and commented on their perceived effectiveness of current cigarette packaging warnings, and 12 text warnings (divided into four themes) on cigarette sticks in preventing non-smokers from smoking, and prompting current smokers to quit. Quantitative data were analysed using proportional odds logistic regression, and qualitative data using conceptual content analysis. From 637 participants, three themes were rated as more effective than current cigarette packaging warnings: mortality statistics, health condition consequences, and social and financial consequences of smoking. Packaging warnings were perceived as less effective due to desensitisation and smoker self-exemption. Stick warnings were considered more novel and engaging, especially the financial costs of smoking. Novel warnings on cigarettes that describe a broader range of consequences of smoking may be effective in combatting tobacco use. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Objective: To characterize the literature, reported enablers, and gaps on the use of patient experience feedback for person-centered rehabilitation quality improvement and codesign activities. Design: Scoping Review. Data sources: Scientific databases (PubMed, CINAHL, Rehabdata, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest), website searches (e.g. Beryl Institute), snowballing, and key-informant recommendations. Methods: Two independent reviewers performed title and abstract screenings and full-text reviews. Eligibility focused on English-language, peer-reviewed (all time) and gray literature (last five years) that used patient experience feedback in rehabilitation improvement activities. The aims, settings, methods, findings, implications, and reported limitations were extracted, followed by content analyses identifying reported enablers and gaps. Results: Among the 901 unique references and 52 full texts reviewed, ten were included: four used patient experience surveys for improving patient experiences; six used codesign methodologies to engage patient feedback in service improvement activities. Implementation enablers included securing managerial support, having a structured methodology and facilitator, using efficient processes, engaging staff experiences, and using appreciative inquiry. Reported study gaps included limited follow-up, low sample sizes, analytical limitations, lack of reported limitations, or narrow range of perspectives (e.g. not from people with severe impairments). Conclusion: Few examples of the use of patient experience feedback in quality improvement or codesign activities were found in the rehabilitation literature. Patient experience improvement activities relied exclusively on retrospective survey data, which were not combined with often more actionable forms (e.g. qualitative, real time) of patient experience feedback. Further research might consider design of activities that collect and use patient experience feedback for rehabilitation service improvements. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Purpose: To perform a systematic review that provides an overview of the current literature on fatigue behavior of removable partial denture (RPD) clasp materials based on different retentive areas. Materials and methods: The review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Electronic searches were done via PubMed, Scopus, and OVID for studies reporting on RPD clasps and the fatigue failure of clasp materials. Inclusion criteria were English language with full text and in vitro studies only. Exclusion criteria were studies that did not assess the fatigue of RPD clasp materials. A quality assessment and selection of full-text articles were performed according to Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials criteria. Results: A total of 182 articles were initially identified and screened. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 15 articles were selected for the final analysis. Seven of the included studies utilized a vertical insertion/removal testing approach. Ten studies used the constant deflection test. Three studies used untapered specimens, and 12 studies used tapered specimens. Ten studies performed post-test analysis. Conclusions: Cobalt-chromium (CoCr) is the strongest material in terms of fatigue in relation to the undercut depth and the modern, digitally manufactured RPD clasp materials also exhibit comparable fatigue behavior. Recent RPD clasp materials such as polyetheretherketone (PEEK) or laser sintered CoCr, however, require further study in terms of their fatigue behavior. In order to improve the quality of future studies, a standardized and calibrated fatigue testing method is needed with standardized specimen size and shape, which will reduce the risk of bias and enable meta-analysis for bulk comparison between studies. © 2022 The Authors.

"Eye movements have been examined as an index of attention and comprehension during reading in the literature for over 30 years. Although eye-movement measurements are acknowledged as reliable indicators of readers’ comprehension skill, few studies have analyzed eye-movement patterns using network science. In this study, we offer a new approach to analyze eye-movement data. Specifically, we recorded visual scanpaths when participants were reading expository science text, and used these to construct scanpath networks that reflect readers’ processing of the text. Results showed that low ability and high ability readers’ scanpath networks exhibited distinctive properties, which are reflected in different network metrics including density, centrality, small-worldness, transitivity, and global efficiency. Such patterns provide a new way to show how skilled readers, as compared with less skilled readers, process information more efficiently. Implications of our analyses are discussed in light of current theories of reading comprehension. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"To assess the efficacy as well as the safety between uncut Roux-en-Y (RY) reconstruction and Billroth II (BII) anastomosis after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (LDG) for gastric cancer. The combination of mesh terms and free-text phrases were generally utilized to explore the database. Computer retrieval of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI), and Wanfang data were conducted by means of clinical efficacy and safety. The time is limited from the construction of the library to July 2021. All statistical evaluations were carried out by Review Manager 5.3. A total of 1208 patients from 11 studies were included in this meta-analysis. The results demonstrated that the hospital stay and time to first flatus of uncut RY were significantly shorter than that of the BII. Moreover, the gastric residue, gastritis, and bile reflux incidences of uncut RY were significantly lower than BII. The results of the meta-analysis revealed that there were no substantial differences between the two groups in the operative time, intraoperative blood loss, nutritional status, and incidence of duodenal stump leakage and anastomotic leakage. Uncut RY reconstruction did not increase operative blood loss, hospital stay, and time to first flatus, effectively reducing gastric residue, gastritis, and bile reflux incidences after LDG. Although it is comparable to BII anastomosis, uncut RY does not offer the advantages such as shorter operative time and better nutritional status. More large-sample, high-quality multicenter RCTs should be able to validate the above conclusions. © 2022, Association of Surgeons of India."
"Companies have an increasing access to very large datasets within their domain. Analysing these datasets often requires the application of feature selection techniques in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data and prioritize features for downstream knowledge generation tasks. Effective feature selection is a key part of clustering, regression and classification. It presents a myriad of opportunities to improve the machine learning pipeline: eliminating redundant and irrelevant features, reducing model over-fitting, faster model training times and more explainable models. By contrast, and despite the widespread availability and use of categorical data in practice, feature selection for categorical and/or mixed data has received relatively little attention in comparison to numerical data. Furthermore, existing feature selection methods for mixed data are sensitive to number of objects by having nonlinear time complexities with respect to number of objects. In this work, we propose a generic multiple association measure for mixed datasets and a novel feature selection algorithm that uses multiple association across features. Our algorithm is based upon the belief that the most representative chosen set of features should be as diverse and minimally dependent on each other as possible. The proposed algorithm formulates the problem of feature selection as an optimization problem, searching for the set of features that have minimum association amongst them. We present a generic multiple association measure and two associated feature selection algorithms: Naive and Greedy Feature Selection Algorithms called NFSA and GFSA, respectively. Our proposed GFSA algorithm is evaluated on 15 benchmark datasets, and compared to four existing state of the art feature selection techniques. We demonstrate that our approach provides comparable downstream classification performance outperforming other leading techniques on several datasets. Both time complexity analysis and experimental results show that our proposed algorithm significantly reduces the processing time required for unsupervised feature selection algorithms especially for long datasets which have a huge number of objects, whilst also yielding comparable clustering and classification performance. On the other hand, we do not recommend our approach for wide datasets where the number of features is huge with respect to the number of objects e.g., image, text and genome datasets. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Purpose: Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) represents a highly profitable biological therapy. Platelet-rich plasma is widely used to treat musculoskeletal disorders despite mixed evidence of its efficacy. As evidenced by literature from other domains, industry funding may influence the results of clinical trials. The objective of the current study was to determine the association between industry funding and positive results for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the efficacy of PRP in musculoskeletal disorders. Methods: A search of four databases was conducted. Included studies were RCTs comparing PRP to any non-PRP comparator in adults (18 years old or over) with musculoskeletal disorders and had full text available in English. Studies were excluded if they were published before 2016 or were non-human trials. A multivariate binomial logistic regression model was created to explore predictors of statistically significant findings. Covariates included the presence of industry funding, sample size, and length of study follow-up. 1440 records were screened with 87 trials included in the final analysis. Results: Of the 87 studies, 61 (70%) reported a statistically significant primary outcome. The presence of industry funding was not predictive of a statistically significant primary outcome [OR = 0.36, 95% CI 0.096–1.36, (n.s.)]. Studies that did not state whether industry funding was present had a higher chance of reporting a statistically significant primary outcome (OR = 3.61, 95% CI 1.1–11.9, p = 0.035). Sample size and length of follow-up were not predictive of a statistically significant primary outcome. Conclusion: The results of the current study conclude that industry funding had no impact on the reporting of positive results for RCTs investigating PRP in musculoskeletal disorders. However, not disclosing sources of funding was associated with a higher likelihood of reporting positive results. The results of trials that fail to disclose funding sources should be interpreted with caution in the PRP literature.

"The aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) task mainly detects the sentiment polarities of aspect terms, or achieves the aspect-opinion co-extraction. Existing ABSA methods usually divide the task into two independent sub-tasks to execute separately, which will result in getting many meaningless pairs due to the following two reasons: the aspect-sentiment pairs extraction task has no reference opinion terms for the interaction, and the aspect-opinion co-extraction task has no reference to their corresponding sentiment dependencies. In recent years, the triplet extraction task is based on above problems with ABSA task to extract aspect terms, opinion terms and sentiment. However, existing triplet extraction methods still have insufficient interaction among the three sub-tasks and serious error propagation problems. Besides, actual sentences often have overlapping aspect words and opinion words. In this paper, we formulate the ABSA as an opinion triplet extraction (OTE) task under the multi-task learning framework. Meanwhile, a method of sharing sentence vectors for opinion triplet extraction (OTE-SSV) is proposed to enhance the extraction ability of text semantic representation and strengthen the interaction among the elements of triplet extraction. Unlike the existing OTE approaches that rely on a pipeline manner for multiple tasks, OTE-SSV uses a concurrent way to extract multiple sub-tasks, which greatly reduces the errors presenting in the previous subtask propagate into the next subtask extraction task. It is experimentally verified that OTE-SSV can also correctly and efficiently extract triplet in sentences with overlapping aspect words and opinion words. Experimental results on four ABSA semeval benchmarks show that F1 measures of OTE-SSV are 1% to 2% obviously superiorer to series of state-of-the-art technologies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Dynamic topic analysis can examine the data from different perspectives and know the distribution of data with different correlation degrees thoroughly. It is a challenge to perform dynamic topic analysis on domain text data due to the smaller semantic differences among subtopics. This paper proposes a method of dynamically constructing topic hierarchy, which uses formal concept analysis (FCA)-based information retrieval (IR) as the technical basis and sememes as the semantic basis to perform hierarchical processing from fine-grained to coarse-grained on Chinese domain text data according to the topics of user’s query. It can meet the user’s need for different scales of the query results, and realize multi-angle inspection of the whole dataset and high-precision retrieval of the query. Taking sememes as formal attributes reduces the size of the concept lattice and expands the application of FCA technology to large-scale text data. The sememe-based word meaning identification (WMI) algorithm and semantic similarity measurement method for long text enable the topic hierarchy to be fine, and the coarse and fine filtering strategy renders the FCA-based method more efficient. Experimental results based on the open dataset show that the method proposed is an efficient and flexible topic-based hierarchical approach. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Situational awareness tries to grasp the important events and circumstances in the physical world through sensing, communication, and reasoning. Tracking the evolution of changing situations is an essential part of this awareness and is crucial for providing appropriate resources and help during disasters. Social media, particularly Twitter, is playing an increasing role in this process in recent years. However, extracting intelligence from the available data involves several challenges, including (a) filtering out large amounts of irrelevant data, (b) fusion of heterogeneous data generated by the social media and other sources, and (c) working with partially geo-tagged social media data in order to deduce the needs of the affected people. Spatio-temporal analysis of the data plays a key role in understanding the situation, but is available only sparsely because only a small fraction of people post relevant text and of those very few enable location tracking. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on data analytics to assess situational awareness from social media big data.  © 2022 IEEE."
"Background: Most health literacy measures require in-person administration or rely upon self-report. Objective: We sought to develop and test the feasibility of a brief, objective health literacy measure that could be deployed via text messaging or online survey. Design: Participants were recruited from ongoing NIH studies to complete a phone interview and online survey to test candidate items. Psychometric analyses included parallel analysis for dimensionality and item response theory. After 9 months, participants were randomized to receive the final instrument via text messaging or online survey. Participants: Three hundred six English and Spanish-speaking adults with ≥ 1 chronic condition Main Measures: Thirty-three candidate items for the new measure and patient-reported physical function, anxiety, depression, and medication adherence. All participants previously completed the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) in parent NIH studies. Key Results: Participants were older (average 67 years), 69.6% were female, 44.3% were low income, and 22.0% had a high school level of education or less. Candidate items loaded onto a single factor (RMSEA: 0.04, CFI: 0.99, TLI: 0.98, all loadings >.59). Six items were chosen for the final measure, named the HL6. Items demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (α=0.73) and did not display differential item functioning by language. Higher HL6 scores were significantly associated with greater educational attainment (r=0.41), higher NVS scores (r=0.55), greater physical functioning (r=0.26), fewer depressive symptoms (r=−0.20), fewer anxiety symptoms (r=−0.15), and fewer barriers to medication adherence (r=−0.30; all p<.01). In feasibility testing, 75.2% of participants in the text messaging arm completed the HL6 versus 66.2% in the online survey arm (p=0.09). Socioeconomic disparities in completion were more common in the online survey arm. Conclusions: The HL6 demonstrates adequate reliability and validity in both English and Spanish. This performance-based assessment can be administered remotely using commonly available technologies with fewer logistical challenges than assessments requiring in-person administration. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of General Internal Medicine."
"Rationale and Objectives: This study evaluated the completeness of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in radiology using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Diagnostic Test Accuracy (PRISMA-DTA) and PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts guidelines between articles published before and those published after the issuance of the guideline and identify areas that have been poorly reported. Materials and Methods: PubMed were searched for systematic reviews on DTA with or without meta-analyses published in general radiology journals between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2020. The identified articles were assessed for completeness of reporting according to the PRISMA-DTA. Subgroup analyses were performed for association of completeness of reporting with multiple cofactors. Results: The search identified 183 reviews from 12 journals. The mean numbers (standard deviation) of reported PRISMA-DTA and PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts items in the full texts and abstracts were 18.45 (2.02) and 5.66 (1.28), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that compared to the corresponding reference groups, a higher mean number of reported PRISMA-DTA items was associated with publication during July 2018–December 2020 [(17.82 (2.01) vs 18.89 (1.91); p = 0.034), citation of the PRISMA-DTA [17.62 (1.86) vs 20.27 (2.02); p < 0.001], and inclusion of supplementary materials [17.64 (2) vs 19.09 (1.8); p < 0.001] on multiple-linear regression analysis. Conclusion: Completeness of reporting with respect to the PRISMA-DTA and PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts has improved modestly since the publication of the PRISMA-DTA guideline; however, increasing awareness of the specific weakness provides the chance for completeness improvement. © 2022 The Association of University Radiologists"
"Readers have different motivations and approaches to text that covers a range of topics and difficulty levels. We introduce the concept of readers’ approaches to text to establish a link between motivational and cognitive aspects of reading comprehension. Study 1 describes the development of a self-report measure of readers’ approaches to text with a community sample. An exploratory factor analysis revealed that The Readers’ Approaches to Text Questionnaire (TReAT-Q) had four subscales: (1) intrinsic goals, (2) extrinsic goals and strategies, (3) effort at understanding, and (4) avoidance of text difficulty. Aside from avoidance of text difficulty, these factors predicted adults’ reading experience above and beyond the related, but more general, measure of need for cognition. A confirmatory factor analysis on TReAT-Q in Study 2 revealed that all subscales except effort at understanding contributed to a readers’ approaches to text latent construct for college students. A subsequent structural equation model (SEM) evaluating a cognitive model of reading comprehension showed that college students’ TReAT-Q scores predicted reading comprehension through an indirect pathway, mediated by reading experience and vocabulary knowledge. Readers who enjoy reading and deploy reading strategies to meet a desired level of understanding tend to have more reading experiences. The SEM also demonstrated the mediating role of vocabulary knowledge in text comprehension by linking reading experience and reading comprehension. Extending beyond measures of motivation, TReAT-Q incorporates the positive and negative approaches readers have to texts, which is fundamental for assessing what readers gain from their reading experiences that assists reading comprehension. © 2022, The Psychonomic Society, Inc."
"We develop new techniques involving group symmetries and complex analysis to obtain exact solutions for the transition probabilities of the M/M/1/k queueing process. These methods are based on the underlying Markovian structure of these random processes and do not involve any generating functions, Laplace transforms, or advanced special functions. Our techniques exploit the intrinsic group symmetries for both the state spaces and the matrix generators of the Markov processes related to the M/M/1/k queue. These results complement and extend the previous transient solutions given by Takács (Introduction to the theory of queues. University texts in the mathematical sciences, Oxford University Press, New York, 1962). Much of the inspiration for this work comes from viewing this queueing process as a fundamental Markovian model for the dynamics of a bike sharing station. The exact transient analysis for a related stopped version of this process can be used to address fundamental decision-making issues for managing bike-sharing services. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Purpose: Social determinants of health (SDoH) impact psychiatric conditions. Routinely collected health data are frequently used to evaluate important psychiatric clinical and health services outcomes. This study explored how key SDoH are used in psychiatric research employing routinely collected health data. Methods: A search was conducted in PubMed for English-language articles published in 2019 that used routinely collected health data to study psychiatric conditions. Studies (n = 19,513) were randomly ordered for title/abstract review; the first 150 meeting criteria progressed to full-text review. Three key SDoH categories were assessed: (1) gender and sex, (2) race and ethnicity, and (3) socioeconomic status. Within each category, data were extracted on how variables were included, defined, and used in study design and analysis. Results: All studies (n = 103) reported on at least one of the key SDoH variables; 102 (99.0%) studies included a gender and/or sex variable, 30 (29.1%) included a race and/or ethnicity variable, and 55 (53.4%) included a socioeconomic status variable. No studies explicitly differentiated between gender and sex, and SDoH were often defined only as binary variables. SDoH were used to define the target population in 14 (13.6%) studies. Within analysis, SDoH were most often included as confounders (n = 65, 63.1%), exposures or predictors (n = 23, 22.3%), and effect modifiers (n = 14, 13.6%). Only 21 studies (20.4%) disaggregated results by SDoH and 7 (6.8%) considered intersections between SDoH. Conclusions: Results suggest improvements are needed in how key SDoH are used in routinely collected health data-based psychiatric research, to ensure relevance to diverse populations and improve equity-oriented research. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."
"Abstract: In the past 10 years, how to visualize human emotions in communication has become an important topic. For providing personalized customer service for enterprises from self-reflection in psychology to opinion mining, emotional visualization uses coded emotional computing results to make various basic charts, and some novel visual analysis systems for all-round analysis which intuitively reveal personal views and emotional styles. Emotion visualization uses coded emotion computing results to reflect the emotion analysis tasks, such as self-reflection in psychology or social media opinion mining results. With the help of various basic charts, infographics, and some novel visual analysis systems, it makes all directions’ analysis and intuitively reveals personal opinions and emotional styles. At present, emotional visualization has developed to use different platforms or multiple platforms to analyze various complex data, including text, sound, image, video, physiological signal or any mixed data. In this paper, we discuss a total of 75 approaches from four different categories: data source type, emotional computing, visual coding and visualization and visual analysis tasks, and 15 subcategories, including visual works mentioned in published paper and interactive visual works published on the Internet. Then, we discuss the further research approaches of emotional visualization and the prospects of emotional visualization under multidimensional data collaboration. We expect that this survey can help researchers interested in emotional visualization of varied data to find a more suitable visualization method for their data and projects.

"Text classification is a method that assigns a specific category to each piece of written information. It is one of the fundamental tasks in natural language processing that has a wide range of applications like spam detection, sentiment analysis, etc. One type of text classification is news classification which can help the reader to focus on news as per their choice. In this paper, we propose a novel method for multiclassification of Punjabi news articles using a pretrained language generation model based optimized and regularized long short-term memory model. The proposed method employs Averaged Stochastic Gradient Descent Weight-Dropped LSTM model, which uses a recurrent regularization technique known as DropConnect on hidden-to-hidden weights and a variant of the averaged stochastic gradient method wherein the averaging trigger is determined using a non-monotonic condition instead of being tuned by the user. The proposed news classification method works in three stages. In the first stage, we train a language model on Punjabi text acquired from Wikipedia, and in the second stage, we fine-tune the language model on the Punjabi news dataset. Finally, we train a classifier using the pretrained encoder part of the language model. The pretrained encoder part of the language model helps the classifier in the linguistic understanding of the text, resulting in better classification results on the text. The results obtained from the proposed work indicate that the proposed method outperforms the other direct methods of news classification, which are not using pretrained language generation models. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Purpose: Numerous approaches to the management of juvenile and aneurysmal bone cysts (ABC) are described in the specialist literature together with discussion of the associated healing and recurrence rates. Since there is currently no evidence-based treatment standard for these conditions, the aim of this systematic literature review with meta-analysis was to examine the different management approaches, evaluate the corresponding clinical outcomes and, as appropriate, to formulate a valid treatment recommendation. Methods: A systematic search on OVID Medline® based on a pre-existing search strategy returned 1333 publications. Having defined inclusion and exclusion criteria and analysis of the relevant full texts, 167 publications were included in the descriptive analysis and 163 in the meta-analysis. For this purpose, different subgroups were created, based on the type of cyst and the therapeutic procedure. Those subgroups were then analysed in relation to their healing rates, the number of recurrences and complication rates. Results: For aneurysmal bone cysts, both surgical removal and Doxycycline injection lead to excellent outcomes (98% healing) and low recurrence rates (6% and 11% resp.). Curettage (91% healing), including its combination with autologous cancellous bone graft (96% healing), showed very good healing rates but higher recurrence rates (22% and 15%, resp.), which were however improved by preoperative selective arterial embolization. A critical view must be taken of radiotherapy (90% healing) and the injection of alcohol (92% healing) because of their high complication rates (0.43/cyst and 0.42/cyst, resp.). In the management of juvenile bone cysts, surgical interventions like curettage and cancellous bone graft (87% healing) are far superior to non-surgical approaches (51% healing), furthermore, the application of autologous cancellous bone graft reduced the recurrence rate (3% recurrence) compared to curettage alone (20% recurrence). In subgroup analysis, treatment by ESIN was found to produce excellent outcomes (100% healing), though the patient collectives were small. Conclusion: Surgical procedures to treat aneurysmal bone cysts appear to be the method of choice whereby Doxycycline injection may be an alternative. A surgical approach should be preferred in the treatment of juvenile bone cysts. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Background: Many women experience giving birth as a negative or even as a traumatic event. Birth space and its occupants are fundamentally interconnected with negative and traumatic experiences, highlighting the importance of the social space of birth. Aim: To explore experiences of women who have had a negative or traumatic birth to identify the value, sense and meaning they assign to the social space of birth. Methods: A feminist standpoint theory guided the research. Secondary discourse analysis of 51 qualitative data sets/transcripts from Dutch and Czech Republic postpartum women and 551 free-text responses of the Babies Born Better survey from women in the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Spain, and the Czech Republic. Findings: Three themes and associated sub-themes emerged: 1. The institutional dimension of social space related to staff-imposed boundaries, rules and regulations surrounding childbirth, and a clinical atmosphere. 2. The relational dimension of social space related to negative women-healthcare provider interactions and relationships, including notions of dominance, power, authority, and control. 3. The personal dimension of social space related to how women internalised and were affected by the negative social dimensions including feelings of faith misplaced, feeling disconnected and disembodied, and scenes of horror. Discussion/conclusion: The findings suggest that improving the quality of the social space of birth may promote better birth experiences for women. The institutional, relational, and personal dimensions of the social space of birth are key in the planning, organisation, and provision of maternity care. © 2023 Australian College of Midwives"
"Background: Early relapse is an adverse outcome of facelift surgery. The rate of early relapse is an indirect measure of the longevity and efficacy of facelift techniques. However, early relapse after facelift is ill-defined, under-evaluated, and under-reported, and literature data on the subject are dispersed. In this systematic review, we aimed to analyze facelift studies using relapse-related outcomes (RROs). Our secondary aim was to highlight the importance of early relapse as an essential outcome measure. Methods: The study design was a systematic review of the English literature and meta-analysis of RROs after facelift surgery. RROs that occurred within the first 2 years after surgery were considered “early”. Performance, analysis, and reporting were performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. The systematic search was conducted using the PubMed database as of February 2020. Initial screening was performed using the keywords “facelift”, “rhytidectomy”, “surgical rejuvenation”, “face lift”, “rhytidoplasty”, and “facial rejuvenation”. Articles were excluded by using a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: RROs were reported only in 4.4% (19/433) of the papers that underwent full-text review. The frequency of RROs ranged between 0.2 and 50% among facelift papers. The weighted median rate of RROs after facelift surgery was found to be 2.4% in the meta-analysis. Conclusions: Future research on preventive measures will be successful upon acknowledgment of the actual prevalence of this problem. Consensus on its definition and objective criteria for its diagnosis are required for further progress.

"This brief presents an X/Ku concurrent dual-wideband power amplifier (PA) monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) fabricated with 0.25{\mu }\text{m} GaN-on-SiC technology. The input matching network (IMN) and output matching network (OMN) of the proposed PA are designed based on electric and magnetic coupled symmetric multi-resonator matching networks (MRMNs) respectively to obtain four reflection zeros. Through symmetrical network analysis method, the four reflection zeros of the matching network are equally divided into two sub frequency bands and an optimal dual-wideband matching performance is realized. The proposed PA obtains average saturated output power of 36.9dBm and 35.9dBm in 9GHz-10GHz and 13.5GHz-16GHz. The measured average power-added efficiency (PAE) are 34.8% and 32.6% in 9GHz-10GHz and 13.5GHz-16GHz.  © 2004-2012 IEEE."
"The growth of videos in our digital age and the users' limited time raise the demand for processing untrimmed videos to produce shorter versions conveying the same information. Despite the remarkable progress that summarization methods have made, most of them can only select a few frames or skims, creating visual gaps and breaking the video context. This paper presents a novel weakly-supervised methodology based on a reinforcement learning formulation to accelerate instructional videos using text. A novel joint reward function guides our agent to select which frames to remove and reduce the input video to a target length without creating gaps in the final video. We also propose the Extended Visually-guided Document Attention Network (VDAN+), which can generate a highly discriminative embedding space to represent both textual and visual data. Our experiments show that our method achieves the best performance in Precision, Recall, and F1 Score against the baselines while effectively controlling the video's output length.  © 1979-2012 IEEE."
"The paper analyses how the discourse on climate governance is re-worked in the urban context. It does so in order to better understand the meaning and possible impact of a growing rhetoric that proclaims the leadership in terms of climate governance of cities that are transitioning towards sustainable futures. By using an approach that employs critical discourse analysis, it examines the institutional climate governance discourse issued by public and private actors in the city of Barcelona, and compares it with the locally-contextualised discourses issued by these same actors during the Car-Free Day campaigns in 2005, 2012 and 2015. The objective is to analyse if private and public discourses internalise and take on the city’s leadership discourse and transfer it to urban climate governance. The comparative examination of texts released by public and private actors points to the discursive strategies of climate governance at the city level taking on meanings that are more descriptive than normative. The paper claims that this has implications for expectations regarding the city’s leadership in transitions towards sustainable futures. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Power and communication line corridors are usually mixed with urban trees, and this mixing can be the source of multiple issues like fires and communication failures. Nevertheless, urban trees are a valuable resource to the city as they dissipate heat island effects, reduce air pollution and increase general health perception. This work proposes a deep learning approach to detect trees entangled to power and communication lines using street-level imagery and perform quick quantitative and qualitative analyses based on the Grad-CAM++ method. Testing the method was performed using 1001 images from urban trees from the cities of São Paulo and Porto Alegre (both in Brazil). We found an overall accuracy of 74.6% (73.6% for São Paulo and 75.6% for Porto Alegre), suggesting that the methodology could be suitable in the future for city management to avoid risks of accidents due to contact between trees and electrical wiring. This text describes the method, a new data set of urban images, the experimental setup design and tests, and some possible future improvements. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Enormous reports, like scanned medical pictures and electronic patient records, are generated by modern healthcare equipment, and these reports must be secured for future access. Conventional storage technologies are incapable of storing large amounts of data. Cloud storage systems, fortunately, satisfy because of their features, like availability and scalability. Although medical images can be saved in the cloud, majority of cloud service providers store them in plain text format. Because of hackers and the increasing computer power, current image encryption methods are vulnerable to attacks. Therefore, a Block chain based Chaotic Deep Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) Encryption Scheme is proposed. The BCDGE uses blockchain technology to protect personal information and verify the authenticity of the data. Secondly, the Chaotic Deep GAN Encryption method uses confusion, substitution, and diffusion principles to encrypt the medical image. The Deep GAN creates image-specific secret keys to improve the resilience against hackers, produced keys utilized as an input for confusion and diffusion phases. The sender transfers the encrypted medical picture to the cloud server, signs the ciphertext ID, and saves it to block chain. The security and performance analysis of the proposed scheme gives better results than the existing schemes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Using massive text data, building a knowledge graph to implement in-depth association analysis and mining can help identify entities and make decisions. The accuracy of traditional Chinese Named Entity Recognition methods is low, and traditional frequent itemset mining methods are also difficult to obtain different types of categories, and their novelty is not high. In this paper, we propose an association rule mining method based on named entity recognition and text classification (ARMTNER). First, the TextCNN model is used to extract the word vector information of the text data; secondly, bidirectional LSTM is used the model extracts the contextual features of the text; then the neural network model is used to automatically extract the word features and the global features of the text for text classification; finally, the text sequence labeling and entity recognition are performed. Then the association rules be used to mine frequent itemsets through two-level classification of text classification and entity classification. The experimental results showed that, our method can achieve an F1-score of 97.3% on the public data set in Chinese Named Entity Recognition, and the novelty of frequent itemsets increased by 0.279%. © 2022, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."
"Background: Prevalence of depression and anxiety in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF) and their caregivers is high, however, results have been inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to estimate the prevalence of depression and anxiety in PwCF and their caregivers and explore sources of heterogeneity. Method: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL plus and PsychINFO databases were searched from inception to January 2021. Studies were included if a specific psychometric tool (PT) to assess depression or anxiety (rather than quality of life) was used and did not involve a transitory patient state. Random-effects models were applied due to high anticipated heterogeneity and I2estimates were calculated. Sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup comparisons. The presence of small-study effects was investigated visually using funnel plots and statistically using the Egger test. Results: A total of 94 articles (48 full-text publications, 46 abstracts) were included. Depression prevalence in adolescents aged 12–18 years (n = 2386), adults (n = 9206) and caregivers (n = 6617) were 18.7% (95% CI 12.8–25.3%, I2 = 89.2%), 27.2% (95% CI 23.6–31%, I2 = 90.4%), and 32.8% (95% CI 27.9–37.9%, I2 = 90.3%), respectively. Anxiety prevalence in adolescents aged 12–18 years (n = 2142) was 26% (95% CI 19.6–33%, I2 = 86.4%), 28.4% (95% CI 25–31.9%, I2 = 85%) for adults (n = 8175), and 38.4% (95% CI 30.8–46.2%, I2 = 94.6%) for caregivers (n = 5931). Prevalence differed by the PT used and study location. Discussion: This comprehensive analysis found the prevalence of depression and anxiety in PwCF and their caregivers to be high, supporting recommendations for regular screening. Choice of PT significantly influenced prevalence, indicating a need for future studies to identify the optimal PT for each CF population to identify those most at risk. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Efficient word representation techniques (word embeddings) with modern machine learning models have shown reasonable improvement on automatic text classification tasks. However, the effectiveness of such techniques has not been evaluated yet in terms of insufficient word vector representation for training. Convolutional Neural Network has achieved significant results in pattern recognition, image analysis, and text classification. This study investigates the application of the CNN model on text classification problems by experimentation and analysis. We trained our classification model with a prominent word embedding generation model, Fast Text on publically available datasets, six benchmark datasets including Ag News, Amazon Full and Polarity, Yahoo Question Answer, Yelp Full, and Polarity. Furthermore, the proposed model has been tested on the Twitter US airlines non-benchmark dataset as well. The analysis indicates that using Fast Text as word embedding is a very promising approach. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Prior work suggests those who lie prolifically tend to be younger and self-identify as male compared to those who engage in everyday lying, but little research has developed an understanding of prolific lying beyond demographics. Study 1 (N = 775) replicated the prior demographic effects and assessed prolific lying through situation-level (e.g., opportunistic cheating) and individual-level characteristics (e.g., dispositional traits, general communication patterns) for white and big lies. For these two lie types, prolific lying associated with more opportunistic cheating, the use of fewer adjectives, and being high on psychopathy compared to everyday lying. Study 2 (N = 1,022) replicated these results and observed a deception consensus effect reported in other studies: the more that people deceived, the more they believed that others deceived as well. This piece develops a deeper theoretical understanding of prolific lying for white and big lies, combining evidence of situational, dispositional, and communication characteristics. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Oropharyngeal dysphagia is common post-stroke and can have serious consequences for patients. Understanding dysphagia recovery is critically important to inform prognostication and support patients and professionals with care planning. This systematic review was undertaken to identify clinical predictors of dysphagia recovery post-stroke. Online databases (EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, and Cochrane) were searched for studies reporting longitudinal swallowing recovery in adults post-stroke. Dysphagia recovery was defined as improvement measured on a clinical swallowing scale or upgrade in oral and/or enteral feeding status by the end of the follow-up period. The search strategy returned 6598 studies from which 87 studies went through full-text screening, and 19 studies were included that met the eligibility criteria. Age, airway compromise identified on instrumental assessment, dysphagia severity, bilateral lesions, and stroke severity were identified as predictors of persistent dysphagia and negative recovery in multiple logistic regression analysis. The available literature was predominated by retrospective data, and comparison of outcomes was limited by methodological differences across the studies in terms of the choice of assessment, measure of recovery, and period of follow-up. Future prospective research is warranted with increased representation of haemorrhagic strokes and uniform use of standardized scales of swallowing function. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"Background: An article published in 2012 in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology discussed the historical sources presenting the Byzantine Empress Zoe Porphyrogenita as an expert in cosmetic and pharmacological remedies that could give their users a youthful appearance and a kind of eternal youth. However, it did not take into account a dermatological recipe attributed to Zoe which text transmission has preserved. Aims: To examine some ingredients of Zoe's recipe from a historical medical point of view and contextualize the text in the tradition of ancient medical matter, physiology of aging, and gender pharmacological skills. Methods: After contextualizing the recipe from the historical medical point of view, some of its ingredients have been analyzed in relation not only to their use in the most authoritative pharmacological and medical sources of antiquity but also to their symbolic meaning. Results: The analysis of Zoe's dermatological recipe allowed to highlight: The links between cosmetics and medicine in Greek and Roman Antiquity. The reason why ancient sources dealing with medical matter attributed to certain substances and plants the power to save the human body from old age and decay. The consistency between the ingredients of Zoe's recipe and the humoral physiology by genders and by age of Hippocrates. The existence of a female tradition in pharmacological competence. Conclusion: Cosmetic dermatology of antiquity is the perfect point in which survival of the myth and rational pharmacology overlap. © 2022 The Authors.

"Learner satisfaction is the degree of consistency between learners’ perception and expectation of learning experience. In massive online open courses, analyzing the influencing factors of learner satisfaction is of great significance to improving the quality of course development and learning experience. Taking the open course reviews as data source, the paper adopted topic sentiment analysis and intermediary hierarchical linear modelling to analyze the impact of different student and course level features on learner satisfaction. The data analysis shows that the schedule, workload and completion status, as well as the video, instructor, content and evaluation topics play significant roles in explaining learner satisfaction; However, perceived difficulty, structure and interaction are not related to learner satisfaction; Meanwhile, sentiment-mediated analysis found that, teachers and evaluation topics have significant mediating effect on schedule; Video topic has a significant mediating effect on workload. Based on the above analysis, enlightenment to curriculum designers and developers are also provided. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Online reviews influence customer decisions and present publicly available data to investigate differences between customer evaluations for local and chain businesses. We conduct a text analysis on a sample of 80,728 online customer reviews of quick-service restaurants to examine how the impact of dining experience attributes on customer evaluation differs between the two restaurant types. Estimation of multilevel multinomial models reveals that customer reviews for local restaurants have less polarized sentiment than chain restaurants. This polarization is also evident for sentiment usage related to four dining experience attributes: food, service, ambience, and price. Although food offerings are essential to get high ratings for local restaurants, service quality has a relatively greater impact on customer satisfaction for chains. Although customer reviews favor local restaurants, they need powerful testimonials for differentiation due to high review valence among their local competitors. © The Author(s) 2022."
"Introduction: The clavicle's nutrient foramen is a surrogate marker for its nutrient artery. Knowing its location may be useful for interpreting fractures and to avoid iatrogenic lesions. The aim of this review was to determine the prevalence, number, location, and direction of the nutrient foramen. Methods: Embase, Medline, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched and supplemented by Google Scholar, hand-searching major anatomical journals, and the reference list of included studies (updated March 08, 2022). Titles and abstracts were screened for eligibility, and observational studies with quantitative data were included based on full text evaluation. Internal validity was assessed using the anatomical quality assessment tool. Pooled prevalence proportions were derived using a random effects DerSimonian-Laird model using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation with Miller's inverse back-transformation. Results: From 18,889 unique reports, 33 studies with 3760 clavicles and 3358 foramina were included. All studies suffered from untransparent reporting. The prevalence of the nutrient foramen was 97.75%, 95% confidence interval 94.70%–99.60%. It was mainly found as a single foramen on the middle third segment's posterior surface with acromial (lateral) obliquity. Results were stable over time, robust to sensitivity analyses, albeit limited by unexplained heterogeneity and asymmetry. Conclusion: This review may aid in interpreting fractures passing through a high-risk area (mean foraminal index range 36.31–61.03%) for lesions to the nutrient artery. Practical implications are a need to update current inaccurate textbook descriptions and further advocate evidence-based anatomy to improve conduct and reporting of anatomical research. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"Introduction: The global pandemic caused by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to an unprecedented demand on critical care resources. The United Kingdom experienced its ‘first wave’ of Coronavirus–19 (Covid-19) disease in Spring 2020. Critical care units had to make major changes to their working practices in a short space of time and faced multiple challenges in doing so, including the challenge of caring for patients in multiple organ failure secondary to Covid-19 infection in the absence of an established evidence base of best practice. We undertook a qualitative investigation of the personal and professional challenges faced by critical care consultants in one Scottish health board in acquiring and evaluating information to guide clinical decision making during the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Methods: Critical care consultants in NHS Lothian working in critical care from March to May 2020 were eligible to participate in the study. Participants were invited to take part in a one-to-one semi structured interview conducted using Microsoft Teams videoconferencing software. Reflexive thematic analysis was used as the method for data analysis using qualitative research methodology informed by a subtle realist position. Results: Analysis of the interview data generated the following themes: The Knowledge Gap; Trust in Information; and Implications for Practice. Illustrative quotes are presented in the text and thematic tables. Discussion: This study explored the experiences of critical care consultant physicians in acquiring and evaluating information to guide clinical decision making during the first wave of the SARS CoV2 pandemic. This study revealed that clinicians were profoundly affected by the pandemic and the ways in which it changed how they could access information to guide clinical decision making. The paucity of reliable information on SARS-CoV-2 posed a significant threat to the clinical confidence of participants. Two strategies were adopted to ease mounting pressures – an organised approach to data collection and the establishment of a local community of collaborative decision-making. These findings contribute to the wider literature by describing health care professionals’ experiences in unprecedented times and could inform recommendations for future clinical practice. This could include governance around responsible information sharing in professional instant messaging groups, and medical journal guidelines on suspension of usual peer review and other quality assurance processes during pandemics. © The Intensive Care Society 2022."
"In 2019 there was an outbreak of coronavirus pandemic also known as COVID-19. Many scientists believe that the pandemic originated from Wuhan, China, before spreading to other parts of the globe. To reduce the spread of the disease, decision makers encouraged measures such as hand washing, face masking, and social distancing. In early 2021, some countries including the United States began administering COVID-19 vaccines. Vaccination brought a relief to the public; it also generated a lot of debates from anti-vaccine and pro-vaccine groups. The controversy and debate surrounding COVID-19 vaccine influenced the decision of several people in either to accept or reject vaccination. Because of data limitations, social media data, collected through live streaming public tweets using an Application Programming Interface (API) search, is considered a viable and reliable resource to study the opinion of the public on Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy. Thus, this study examines 3 sentiment computation methods (Azure Machine Learning, VADER, and TextBlob) to analyze COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Five learning algorithms (Random Forest, Logistics Regression, Decision Tree, LinearSVC, and Naïve Bayes) with different combination of three vectorization methods (Doc2Vec, CountVectorizer, and TF-IDF) were deployed. Vocabulary normalization was threefold; potter stemming, lemmatization, and potter stemming with lemmatization. For each vocabulary normalization strategy, we designed, developed, and evaluated 42 models. The study shows that Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy slowly decreases over time; suggesting that the public gradually feels warm and optimistic about COVID-19 vaccination. Moreover, combining potter stemming and lemmatization increased model performances. Finally, the result of our experiment shows that TextBlob + TF-IDF + LinearSVC has the best performance in classifying public sentiment into positive, neutral, or negative with an accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score of 0.96752, 0.96921, 0.92807 and 0.94702 respectively. It means that the best performance was achieved when using TextBlob sentiment score, with TF-IDF vectorization and LinearSVC classification model. We also found out that combining two vectorizations (CountVectorizer and TF-IDF) decreases model accuracy. © 2022 The Authors"
"The current study extends the literature on emerging adults by examining their communication with parents and peers simultaneously. Specifically, emerging adults’ communication patterns and the relationships among communication, well-being, and their perceptions of parents’ involvement and autonomy support are explored. Emerging adults (N = 328) reported their frequency of communication in person, over the phone, via text message, and on social networking sites with mother, father, and closest friend. A Latent Profile Analysis revealed four communication patterns (Low communication, Friend-oriented, Parent-oriented, and Multimedia). Communication patterns with mothers and fathers were similar; youth used more text messaging and social networking with friends. A Friend-oriented communication pattern was associated with psychological well-being while the Multimedia group reported higher social well-being. © 2022 Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood and SAGE Publishing."
"Issue addressed: Australian sport policy calls for a diverse sector to get more individuals more active. This study contributes to an evidence base of alternative sport options that may increase physical activity levels in adolescents, as we sought to understand why Australians decide to participate in fencing when aged <18 years. Methods: A retrospective, mixed-methods survey design was employed to measure why a participant started fencing and what participants like about fencing compared to other sports. Free-text qualitative data were analysed thematically. Quantitative data were collected to answer secondary objectives, using nonparametric tests to determine significance between the median scores prefencing and postfencing for enjoyment and frequency of participation. Results: One hundred and one fencers across Australia who started fencing aged <18 years completed the survey. Respondents primarily started fencing for fun/enjoyment, followed by the desire to try something different/alternative/nonmainstream. Four themes were identified relating to why a participant decided to start fencing: (i) external motivators, (ii) influence of interest and imagination, (iii) developing the self and (iv) the supportive culture. Conclusions: Fencing may encourage adolescent participation in physical activity due to unique characteristics which attracts individuals for reasons beyond the need to be active alone, and instead affords a space for self-exploration, learning, and belonging. Further research is required to identify how fencing can engage different cohorts of adolescents, and any barriers to participation. So what?: Fencing could be utilised to promote engagement in physical activity among Australian adolescents by emphasising the creative, mental, and inclusive aspects of the sport. © 2022 The Authors.

"Importance: Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on COVID-19 are increasingly being posted as preprints before publication in a scientific, peer-reviewed journal. Objective: To assess time to journal publication for COVID-19 RCT preprints and to compare differences between pairs of preprints and corresponding journal articles. Evidence Review: This systematic review used a meta-epidemiologic approach to conduct a literature search using the World Health Organization COVID-19 database and Embase to identify preprints published between January 1 and December 31, 2021. This review included RCTs with human participants and research questions regarding the treatment or prevention of COVID-19. For each preprint, a literature search was done to locate the corresponding journal article. Two independent reviewers read the full text, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool. Time to publication was analyzed using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Differences between preprint and journal article pairs in terms of outcomes, analyses, results, or conclusions were described. Statistical analysis was performed on October 17, 2022. Findings: This study included 152 preprints. As of October 1, 2022, 119 of 152 preprints (78.3%) had been published in journals. The median time to publication was 186 days (range, 17-407 days). In a multivariable model, larger sample size and low risk of bias were associated with journal publication. With a sample size of less than 200 as the reference, sample sizes of 201 to 1000 and greater than 1000 had hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.23 (95% CI, 0.80-1.91) and 2.19 (95% CI, 1.36-3.53) for publication, respectively. With high risk of bias as the reference, medium-risk articles with some concerns for bias had an HR of 1.77 (95% CI, 1.02-3.09); those with a low risk of bias had an HR of 3.01 (95% CI, 1.71-5.30). Of the 119 published preprints, there were differences in terms of outcomes, analyses, results, or conclusions in 65 studies (54.6%). The main conclusion in the preprint contradicted the conclusion in the journal article for 2 studies (1.7%). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that there is a substantial time lag from preprint posting to journal publication. Preprints with smaller sample sizes and high risk of bias were less likely to be published. Finally, although differences in terms of outcomes, analyses, results, or conclusions were observed for preprint and journal article pairs in most studies, the main conclusion remained consistent for the majority of studies. © 2023 American Medical Association.

"The ""Four Orientations"" (orienting to the world science and technology frontier, orienting to the main battlefield of the economy, orienting to the major needs of the country, and orienting to the health of the people) has become a pointer to the China's scientific development in the new era. Governance is not only a comprehensive field that reflects the international research frontier of ""Four Orientations"", but also the core point of geography and other disciplines. This paper focuses on the key issues of challenges in geography researches governance. Based on the concept of human-nature coupling, by using comprehensive methods such as bibliometrics and text analysis, this paper systematically sorts out the research trajectory and characteristics of governance research in geography at home and abroad. What is more, this paper explores the geography research paths for governance from the four dimensions of value, thought, method, and technology. By closely combining the development of geography and the practice of governance modernization, it improves the integration strategies of geography and governance at basic research, platform construction and talents cultivation. The purpose of this paper is to enhance the influence of Chinese geography in governance research worldwide and promote the integration of geography with other disciplines, to apply the thinking and approach of human-nature coupling in the practice of social governance, and to improve people's well-being and serve the national strategies and regional sustainable development. © 2023, Science Press.

"This collection explores the links between multimodality and multilingualism, charting the interplay between languages, channels and forms of communication in multilingual written texts from historical manuscripts through to the new media of today and the non-verbal associations they evoke. The volume argues that features of written texts such as graphics, layout, boundary marking and typography are inseparable from verbal content. Taken together, the chapters adopt a systematic historical perspective to investigate this interplay over time and highlight the ways in which the two disciplines might further inform one another in the future as new technologies emerge. The first half of the volume considers texts where semiotic resources are the sites of modes, where multiple linguistic codes interact on the page and generate extralinguistic associations through visual features and spatial organizaisation. The second half of the book looks at texts where this interface occurs not in the text but rather in the cultural practices involved in social materiality and text transmission. Enhancing our understandings of multimodal resources in both historical and contemporary communication, this book will be of interest to scholars in multimodality, multilingualism, historical communication, discourse analysis and cultural studies.

"Introduction Digital technologies present tremendous opportunities for enabling long-term measurement of mental health in the general population. Emerging studies have established preliminary efficacy of collecting self-report data digitally. However, a key challenge when developing a new self-report instrument is navigating the abundance of existing instruments to select relevant constructs for measurements. This review is a precursor to developing a novel future integrated digital instrument for repeated measurements. We interrogate the literature as the first step towards optimal measurement of the multifaceted mental health concept, in the context of digital repeated measurement. This review aims to identify (1) digital self-report instruments administered repeatedly to measure the mental health of the general adult population; (2) their structure and format; (3) their psychometric properties; (4) their usage in empirical studies; and (5) the constructs these instruments were designed to measure (as characterised in the original publication), and the constructs the instruments have been used to measure in the identified empirical studies. Methods and analysis Five major electronic databases will be searched. Studies administering mental health instruments (in English) repeatedly to community dwellers in the general adult population are eligible. A reviewer will preliminarily screen for eligible studies. Then, two reviewers will independently screen the full text of the eligible articles and extract data. Both reviewers will resolve any disagreement through discussion or with a third reviewer. After the data extraction, a reviewer will manually search for the structure, format, psychometric properties and the original constructs these instruments were developed to measure. This review will synthesise the results in a narrative approach. The reporting in this review will be guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required as no data will be collected. Findings of the systematic review will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. PROSPERO registration number CRD42022306547  © 2022 Emergency Medicine Journal.

"Purpose: The extant literature has utilized the SERVQUAL scale to measure service quality dimensions and their importance towards customer-satisfaction using close-ended survey-based questions and not open-ended questions and/or user-generated qualitative responses. On the other hand, while measuring customer-satisfaction drivers from user-generated content (UGC), extant studies have majorly used overall or aspect-wise evaluations and not evaluations specific to SERVQUAL dimensions. In this study, the authors try to bridge the gap. Design/methodology/approach: The authors suggest a methodology consisting of text mining, machine learning and econometric techniques that can measure consumer evaluations of SERVQUAL dimensions. The authors used qualitative and quantitative UGC obtained from 27,052 online reviews on 362 airlines by reviewers of 158 nationalities for our analysis. Findings: The authors established a unique method which combines qualitative and qualitative UGC to measure service quality. The authors have also uncovered the comparative importance of such dimensions in creating customer-satisfaction and recommendation in the context of the airline industry. Originality/value: The paper is one of the pioneering studies that try to find measures of SERVQUAL dimensions from online consumer reviews and their influence on customer satisfaction. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"A two-round Delphi study was conducted to explore priorities for addressing online risk to individuals. A corpus of literature was created based on 69 peer-reviewed articles about privacy risk and the privacy calculus published between 2014 and 2019. A cluster analysis of the resulting text-base using Pearson’s correlation coefficient resulted in seven broad topics. After two rounds of the Delphi survey with experts in information security and information literacy, the following topics were identified as priorities for further investigation: personalisation versus privacy, responsibility for privacy on social networks, measuring privacy risk, and perceptions of powerlessness and the resulting apathy. The Delphi approach provided clear conclusions about research topics and has potential as a tool for prioritising future research areas. © The Author(s) 2021."
"The present essay analyses Paz Encina’s film Hamaca Paraguaya (2006), the first feature film made in Paraguay since 1978, focusing on the way in which the Paraguayan filmmaker conceives the transmutation of the Guarani indigenous myth into the language of cinema and fiction. The text examines formal choices in Encina's film, such as the desynchronization between image and sound and, above all, the important and singular aesthetic and temporal exercise with the out-of-frame, addressing both its spectrality and its staging of the visible and the invisible. © Autor(es)."
"Outbreak updates are an integral part of crisis communication during epidemics. Regarding the COVID-19 crisis communication, localities in China present different strategies for managing outbreak updates, which largely determine the effect of crisis communication and the evolution of social psychology. Depending on the analysis of the update texts from 31 provincial (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government) health committees in China, the study found the differences among the provincial outbreak updates and summarizes 12 innovative crisis communication ways. A coupling analysis was applied using the equilibrium-cognitive-psychosocial transition model to further expound on the psychological connotation and intervention potential of the crisis communication innovations. Coupling crisis communication with interventions has a positive effect on designing crisis communication strategies by taking into account psychological factors. It can help construct and optimize the public crisis communication systems and emphasize “care” in modernizing the emergency management capacity. Copyright © 2023 Zhou, Yu, Tang and Li."
"Institutions—defined as strategies, norms and rules (Ostrom Understanding institutional diversity, Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2005)—are omnipresent in third sector contexts. In this paper, we present the Institutional Grammar (IG) as a theoretically informed approach to support institutional analysis in third sector research. More specifically, the IG coding syntax allows the researcher to systematically wade through rich text and (transcribed) spoken language to identify and dissect institutional statements into finer syntactical segments of interest to the researcher. It is a versatile method that can generate data for small- or large-N research projects and can be integrated with mixed-method research designs. After first introducing and describing the IG, we present a case study to illustrate how a IG-based syntactic analysis can be leveraged to inform third sector research. In the case, we ask: Do the rules embedded in regulatory text addressing the involuntary dissolution of charity organizations differ between bifurcated and unitary jurisdictions in the United States? Using IG’s ABDICO 2.0 syntax, we identify eleven “Activation Condition” (AC) categories that trigger action and assess variation among the 46 jurisdictions. We ultimately conclude that the rules do not differ between bifurcated and unitary jurisdictions, but that finding is not the primary concern. The case demonstrates IG as an important methodological advance that yields granular, structured analyses of rules, norms and strategies in third sector settings that may be difficult to identify with other methods. We then emphasize four areas of third sector research that could benefit from the addition of IG-based methods: analysis of (1) rule compliance, (2) inter-organizational collaboration, (3) comparative study of institutional design, and (4) the study of institutional change. We close the paper with some reflections on where IG-based analysis is headed. © 2021, The Author(s)."
"The sentiment analysis has gained its importance in recent years. People had improved their way of expressing their opinions about products, services, celebrities, and current topics in internet portals, blogs and social networks. The social network websites like Face book, Twitter, WhatsApp, LinkedIn and Hike messenger, providing the users to express their feelings by using the different symbols like smiley’s, funny faces, etc., These social media websites provide a platform to display peoples’ opinions on topics like movies, products, fashion trends, politics, technologies were expressed. The E-Commerce portals like Amazon, Flip Kart, Snap deal etc., help the people to express their opinions on products. A framework is proposed in this work to find the scores of the opinions and derive conclusions. The classification of opinions is called opinion mining, whereas deriving the scores for those opinions are called sentiment analysis. Here the Classification techniques are used for opinion mining and the scores to those opinions are given by taking a scale from –5 to +5.In this work, a movie review data set has been collected from the twitter reviews (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) between the years 2003 and 2012. The Word net lexicon dictionary is used to compare the emotions for obtaining the score. In this paper, the proposed improved RBF kernel of SVM-performed with 98.8% of accuracy when compared with the existing SVM-RBF classifier and other models. © 2020, Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management."
"This paper provides quantitative comparison between the text embedding of a text pre-trained model (i.e., RoBERTa) and a multi-modal pre-trained model (i.e., WenLan). Two quantitative comparison methods are proposed, in an embedding space: representing the semantics of a word using the set of k-nearest words to it and then analyze the semantic changes of the word in the two spaces using the Jaccard similarity of the two sets; forming pairs between each word and its nearest k words to analyze the relationship. The results show that the multi-modal pre-training brings more semantic changes for more abstract words (e.g., success, love), and the multi-modal pre-trained model can better differentiate antonyms and discover more hypernyms or hyponyms, while text pre-training works better in finding synonyms. Moreover, multi-modal pre-trained model can construct a more extensive associative relationship between words. © 2023 Peking University. All rights reserved."
"Introduction: Reading is an attempt to comprehend the writer’s message for personal growth and success in the relevant fields. Thus, psychologists consider it a multifaceted cognitive process of constructing meanings from texts. The present study was conducted to determine the relationships among students’ reading habits, study skills, and academic achievement in English at the secondary level in Punjab, Pakistan. Methods: The (n = 1614) students enrolled in the science section for the academic year 2019–2020 participated in this descriptive correlational survey, selected from 40 high schools in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, through a non-proportionate stratified random sampling technique. The Reading Habits Questionnaire (RHQ) and the Study Skills Scale (SSS) were used to collect data about students’ reading habits and study skills. At the same time, academic achievement was the students’ grades obtained in the ninth class in the subject of English that were determined by the Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) Lahore in 2019. Students’ responses were analyzed through descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: The results indicated that students have competent reading habits and study skills. The correlational findings showed a strong positive relationship among reading habits, study skills, and academic achievement in English, while moderate positive relationships between reading habits and academic achievement in English. However, regression analysis results were significant, while reading habits and study skills moderately predicted academic achievement. Discussion: It is implicated that teachers should plan such assignments and tasks based on reflective thinking by considering the role of study skills in academic achievement. Moreover, teachers and school administrators could mutually create timetables for library lessons to build reading habits and study skills among learners.

"Cinema, the medium showcasing moving images, has undergone dynamic change across history. From silent films to films being shot entirely over a green screen, the development seems indisputable. While globalization boosted the possibility of films entering newer boundaries, the storytelling evolved to fit the demands of newer audiences and contexts. The linguistic difference among landscapes required modes of translation for cinema. There emerged the prospect of subtitles, present as text at the bottom of the screening, and functioning as a visual facilitator to audiences. Although its function innately was to act as a visual facilitator, subtitles on-screen heavily impact the story's narrative and manipulate how the audience perceives it. This paper intends to study how subtitles' presence hinders audiences' experience viewing a foreign film. The paper considers the influence of subtitles on the audience's attention to the smallest unit of a film, i.e., the frames, and then goes ahead to access the idea of novelty imparts through its presence to the whole film. It also explores how the technical know-how of filmmaking, such as coloring, editing, and cinema coloring, is influenced. It also analyses the foreignness that lack of familiarity with subtitles' language is often a barrier to an effective understanding of a story. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

"Purpose: In accommodation-sharing, hosts must provide satisfactory stay experiences for guests, who will then express intentions to revisit (behavioral loyalty) and/or recommend the experiences to others (attitudinal loyalty) in their reviews. Through the lens of expectation-confirmation theory, this study aims to investigate the service dimensions customers focus on in their reviews and their relationships with customer-loyalty manifestations in accommodation-sharing. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses topic modeling to discover distinctive dimensions from Airbnb reviews from a micro perspective and map them onto overarching themes from a macro perspective, and further examine the relationships among topics using cluster analysis. Findings: This study reveals “information” as an important theme rarely mentioned in the literature. Besides, “homeliness” is a unique dimension associated with behavioral and attitudinal loyalty toward accommodation-sharing. Practical implications: The findings help accommodation-sharing platforms and hosts identify customer concerns and the drivers of customer loyalty in accommodation-sharing. Originality/value: In the existing literature, customer perceptions and loyalty are largely determined through surveys, and the findings are not univocal due to the inconsistencies of measurement items used, the potential response bias and limited sample sizes. This study capitalizes on the wealth of user-generated content and extracts service dimensions and customer loyalty directly from textual reviews, overcoming previous research limitations. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"This study presents preliminary observations of a collection of manuscripts from a private household in the town of Lo Monthang, in Mustang, Nepal. The manuscripts, which were used by generations of royal priests belonging to a family named Drangsong, contain for the most part ritual texts for the protection and prosperity of the kingdom of Mustang and its subjects. The collection of 280 manuscripts, assembled from different parts of Tibet and the Himalaya over six centuries, was subjected to codicological and text-historical research. The shuffled folios were first sorted into distinct texts that were numbered and photographed. Further analyses were then undertaken on the basis of images and notes taken in situ, as well as loose pieces of paper from the most damaged leaves identified within individual volumes. Knowledge of the materials and ritual practices involved in the creation of physical objects have been applied to better understand the textual, material and social aspects of this unknown, unique and endangered collection. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

"Background: Mobile applications (apps) exist to promote early child development; however, few studies have examined use of these apps among low-income families. Our objectives were to measure engagement with the Engage, Develop, Learn (EDL) app and determine if it promoted engagement and behavior change among low-income caregivers. Methods: We conducted a pilot study among English and Spanish-speaking, low-income families with children ages 12 to 15 months who received either the EDL app or injury prevention text messages. Baseline data were collected and interventions delivered over two home visits. App engagement was measured using messages opened. Caregiver development-promoting behaviors were measured with STIMQ score changes from baseline to follow-up at child age 2 years. We conducted key informant interviews among families randomized to receive the EDL app to identify barriers and facilitators to app use. Results: A total of 100 caregivers were recruited at their children’s preventive care visit with 50 randomized to receive the EDL app and 50 to receive the injury prevention text messages; however, only 25 in the development app and 34 in the injury prevention group completed both home visits. Follow-up data were collected from 14 in the development app group and 30 in the injury prevention group. Over 10 weeks, 24% (6/25) remained engaged with the development app. STIMQ scores did not differ between groups. Barriers included technical difficulties accessing the app, social stressors, and ‘forgetting’ to use it. Conclusions: Our pilot randomized trial of a child development app suggests that it may not be effective for promoting behavior change among low-income caregivers due to low engagement. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Background: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) affects almost half the population, and several treatments intending to regenerate a normal scalp hair phenotype are used. This is the first study comparing treatment efficacy response and resistance using standardized continuous outcomes. Objective: To systematically compare the relative efficacy of treatments used for terminal hair (TH) regrowth in women and men with AGA. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted (from inception to August 11, 2021) to identify randomized, Placebo-controlled trials with ≥ 20 patients and reporting changes in TH density after 24 weeks. Efficacy was analyzed by sex at 12 and 24 weeks using Bayesian network meta-analysis (B-NMA) and compared to frequentist and continuous outcomes profiles. Results: The search identified 2,314 unique articles. Ninety-eight were included for full-text review, and 17 articles met the inclusion criteria for data extraction and analyses. Eligible treatments included ALRV5XR, Dutasteride 0.5 mg/day, Finasteride 1 mg/day, low-level laser comb treatment (LLLT), Minoxidil 2% and 5%, Nutrafol, and Viviscal. At 24 weeks, the B-NMA regrowth efficacy in TH/cm2 and significance (**) in women were ALRV5XR: 30.09**, LLLT: 16.62**, Minoxidil 2%: 12.13**, Minoxidil 5%: 10.82**, and Nutrafol: 7.32**, and in men; ALRV5XR: 21.03**, LLLT: 18.75**, Dutasteride: 18.37**, Viviscal: 13.23, Minoxidil 5%: 13.13**, Finasteride: 12.38, and Minoxidil 2%: 10.54. Two distinct TH regrowth response profiles were found; Continuous: ALRV5XR regrowth rates were linear in men and accelerated in women; Resistant: after 12 weeks, LLLT, Nutrafol, and Viviscal regrowth rates attenuated while Dutasteride and Finasteride plateaued; Minoxidil 2% and 5% lost some regrowth. There were no statistical differences for the same treatment between women and men. B-NMA provided more accurate, statistically relevant, and conservative results than the frequentist-NMA. Conclusion: Some TH regrowth can be expected from most AGA treatments with less variability in women than men. Responses to drug treatments were rapid, showing strong early efficacy followed by the greatest resistance effects from flatlining to loss of regrowth after 12–16 weeks. Finasteride, Minoxidil 2% and Viviscal in men were not statistically different from Placebo. LLLT appeared more efficacious than pharmaceuticals. The natural product formulation ALRV5XR showed better efficacy in all tested parameters without signs of treatment resistance (see Graphical abstract).

"Android is the most preferred mobile operating system in the world. Applications are available from both official application repositories and other application stores. For these reasons, there has been a remarkable increase in malware for the Android operating system in recent years. In this study, a novel Android malware detection system is proposed by using filter-based feature selection methods. The proposed approach is static Android malware detection based on machine learning. Permissions extracted from application files are used as features in the developed system. Dimension reduction is carried out with eight different feature selection methods to enhance the running time and efficiency of machine learning algorithms. While four of these methods are used in Android malware detection systems, the remaining four methods are adapted from text classification studies. The adapted methods are compared in terms of both extracted features and classification results. When the results are examined, it is shown that the adapted methods improve the efficiency of the classification algorithms and can be used in this field. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."

"In order to stimulate research and development in their companies, managers, and technical experts might aim at identifying frugal patents from third parties by means of advanced text mining techniques. The same may be true for scientists who wish to improve their understanding of frugal inventions. For this purpose, we present a process model in four steps, and particularly analyze the evaluation step by applying different text-mining methods, namely search string refinement and topic modeling. Testing the process model in the technological field of white goods, we find that the process model as a whole as well as both evaluation methods are able to detect frugal patent candidates. Nevertheless, both methods have different profiles in terms of precision and recall. As a theoretical contribution, we suggest differentiating between two types of frugal invention namely those with frugal attributes concentrated in parts of the description and those with frugal attributes distributed throughout the description. As a managerial contribution, we show that a hybrid solution may be effective in identifying frugal patent candidates while reducing manual efforts for evaluation at the same time.  © 2022 IEEE."
"With the supposition that architectural discourse has an interdisciplinary nature, this study aims to display the way literary fiction borrows several themes from architectural discourse in order to form its “literary spaces” as well as the way architectural discourse borrows several themes from other social sciences, especially from sociology. Thus, new wave science fiction writer J.G. Ballard’s literature provides a fruitful resource for the construction of this study. It will be demonstrated that spatial data within the five selected works of Ballard exist in a similar way within architectural discourse of the recent past that criticizes modern architectural movement via several themes. An analysis will be made parallel to the discourses of the critiques of modern architectural discourse. In this sense, intersecting both the discourse of architecture and that of Ballard, there emerge three common themes to focus on: social isolation, class discrimination as a result of social isolation, and alienation in the modern world. While displaying the mediatory role of architectural discourse between sociology and literary fiction through reading in the spatiality of the text, the study will also draw lessons to be learned from Ballard’s works emphasizing the production of design theory through the field of discourse. © The Author(s) 2020."
"The commercial homogenization of ancient town tourism destination is the main manifestation of the homogenization of this type of tourism destination. Although to some extent this phenomenon promotes the economic development of the tourism destination, it also affects the tourism experience of tourists and leads to the disorder of the commercial operation of the destination. Taking Dali ancient city as an example, this study obtained the street view image data inside the ancient city through programming, and used computer vision, machine learning, and other technologies to identify the shop sign text information in the street view images. On this basis, this study constructed an index model to measure the commercial homogeneity of the case, and examined the spatial characteristics and formation mechanism of the commercial homogenization of the ancient town tourism destination. The conclusions are as follows: 1) Spatially, the overall commercial homogeneity of Dali ancient city presents the characteristics of core-periphery distribution. The commercial homogenization degree of stores is high in the core tourism area, showing the characteristics of street-level distribution, while the commercial homogenization degree of service firms is high in the peripheral tourism area, showing the characteristics of city block-level distribution. 2) The distribution of tourism resources, planning and regulation, location conditions, and capital intervention are the main factors leading to commercial homogenization. Competition and spatial aggregation are the two leading mechanisms to form commercial homogenization. 3) Using computer vision and machine learning technologies to extract the shop sign text information in the street view images and taking the repetition number and agglomeration level of the same type of shops as indicators to build a model, combined with GIS spatial analysis method, we can realize the spatial measurement of the commercial homogeneity of the ancient town tourism destination. © 2023, Editorial office of PROGRESS IN GEOGRAPHY.

"Phonological impairment contributes to deficits in repetition and spoken naming in logopenic variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA), but weakened phonology can also affect written language skills. In this experimental case report, we demonstrate phonological text agraphia in a 71-year-old woman in the early stages of lvPPA that undermined her ability to write meaningful, grammatical sentences. We investigated the therapeutic value of a rigorous treatment protocol to strengthen phonological manipulation skills coupled with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Intervention took place 5 days a week for 2 weeks with active tDCS, followed by a 2-month rest period, and then a second period of phonological treatment with sham tDCS. Over the course of treatment, our participant demonstrated improved phonological transcoding and manipulation skills as well as marked improvement in the proportion of grammatically well-formed, meaningful written narratives. Improvements in spelling and letter selection were also observed. Treatment gains were documented during phonological intervention in both active tDCS and sham treatment phases and were maintained 2 months after the conclusion of intervention. Importantly, improvements were observed in the context of a progressive disorder. These data present compelling evidence regarding the impairment-based approach that targets compromised phonological skills, presenting opportunity for improving functional written communication skills relevant to the everyday lives of individuals with lvPPA.

"There is an established agenda seeking to disentangle the relationship between journal articles’ title, keywords, or abstract attributes and their association with bibliometric performance. To date, however, there have been few comparative, benchmarking studies in MBR (management-business research), particularly between top-tier, mid-tier, and periodicals with predatory features. This study aims to provide such a benchmark by identifying significant differences/similitudes in the lexical structure of article titles and abstracts of six MBR journals: Academy of Management Journal and Strategic Management Journal, both distinguished journals in the discipline; Corporate Reputation Review and Journal of Global Information Management, two mid-tier journals; and WSEAS Transactions on Business and Economics and Problems and Perspectives in Management, both identified as journals with predatory features. Three content analysis methods were used: (i) semantic networks; (ii) text readability; (iii) and lexical diversity indices (i.e., Flesch-Kincaid grade level and Yule’s K). Kruskal–Wallis tests were also implemented to identify differences between groups. The findings showed no significant differences in article length, irrespective of groups. Significant differences were found, however, in the readability and lexical diversity of the abstracts, with those in the top-tier group having a lower median readability and higher median lexical diversity. Key-terms with higher betweenness were also found to be similar to those central to MBR in developing countries and top-tier journals on strategy. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Introduction Relevant clinical information is vital to inform the analytical and interpretative phases of most investigations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of implementation of computerised provider order entry (CPOE), featuring order-specific electronic order entry forms (eOEFs), on the quality and quantity of clinical information included with investigation requests. Methods The CPOE module of a commercially available electronic health record (Cerner Millennium) was implemented at a large, tertiary care centre. The laboratory information management system was interrogated to collect data on specimens sent for microbiological culture 1 year before implementation of CPOE (2018), immediately post implementation (2019) and 6 months post implementation (2020). An interrupted time series analysis was performed, using text mining, to evaluate the quality and quantity of free-text clinical information. Results In total, 39 919 specimens were collected from 16 458 patients. eOEFs were used to place 10 071 out of 13 735 orders in 2019 (73.3%), and 9155 out of 12 229 orders in 2020 (74.9%). No clinical details were included with 653 out of 39 919 specimens (1.6%), of which 22 (3.4%) were ordered using eOEFs. The median character count increased from 14 in 2018, to 41 in 2019, and 38 in 2020. An anti-infective agent was specified in 581 out of 13 955 requests (4.2%) in 2018; 5545 out of 13 735 requests (40.4%) in 2019; and 5215 out of 12 229 requests (42.6%) in 2020. Ciprofloxacin or piperacillin-tazobactam (Tazocin) were mentioned in the clinical details included with 421 out of 15 335 urine culture requests (2.7%), of which 406 (96.3%) were ordered using eOEFs. Subsequent detection of in vitro non-susceptibility led to a change in anti-infective therapy for five patients. Conclusions Implementation of CPOE, featuring order-specific eOEFs, significantly and sustainably improves the quality and quantity of clinical information included with investigation requests, resulting in changes to patient management that would not otherwise have occurred.  © 2023 Author(s).

"Purpose: This study aims to explore how corporate social responsibility (CSR) has assumed a new meaning today, with the COVID-19 pandemic. This, in turn, has changed the way companies now view the impact of their activities on the environment, customers, employees, community and other stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: This paper uses a qualitative case study approach and draws a critical lens to document the complex interplay between dimensions of CSR, business sustainability and social issues, applying theoretical tools such as social capital theory and stakeholder theory to elucidate the nature of collaborative managerial responses to the organisation’s challenges during the pandemic. This is a case study paper. This paper applies multi method approach to develop a case study analysis through participant observation and report analysis to investigate the CSR approaches undertaken in India by Infosys Genesis, a global leader in technology services and consulting, and Akshaya Patra Foundation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO), which operates the world’s largest lunch school program. This was an appropriate methodology since the focus was on an area that was little understood, while the analysis required an in-depth understanding of a complex phenomenon through observation and a case study. In addition, case study research has been recommended for how, why and what type of research questions that focus on contemporary events (Saunders et al., 2003; Yin, 1994), such as CSR participation in the existing business environment. Furthermore, the issue under investigation is a real-life situation where the limitations between the phenomenon and the body of knowledge are unclear (Yin, 1994). This was the case because CSR has been probed by numerous disciplines through the application of various theoretical frameworks, each interpreting the context from their own perspective. Leximancer was used for the analysis (a text-mining software for visualising the structure of concepts and themes across case studies). This process differs from the traditional content analysis in that specific word strings are not needed; instead, Leximancer recognises what concepts are present in a set of texts, permitting concepts to be automatically coded in a grounded fashion (Cretchley et al., 2010, p. 2). The paper will be looked at from three levels comprising themes, concepts and concept profiling to create rich and reliable dimensions of a theoretical model (Myers, 2008). The themes are created in Leximancer software and are built on an algorithm that looks for hidden repeated patterns in interactions. The concepts add a layer and discover which concepts are shared by actors. The concept profiling allows to discover additional concepts and allows to do a discriminant analysis on prior concepts (Cretchley et al., 2010). Words that come up frequently are treated as concepts. Although the limited number of cases does not represent the entire sector, it enabled collection of rich data through quotes revealing some of the most crucial aspects of large organisations and non-profits in India. Findings: The findings demonstrate how these robust, innovative, collaborative CSR initiatives between a multinational firm and an NGO have been leveraged to combat manifold issues of education, employment and hunger during the pandemic. Research limitations/implications: Despite significant implications, this study has limitations. A response from only two companies is investigated to the COVID-19 pandemic. The scope of this study is only India, a developing nation, thereby, cross country research is recommended. A comparative study between developed and developing countries may be conducted. A quantitative approach may be used to get empirical findings of the COVID-19 pandemic and post-pandemic policies of companies from an international perspective. Hence, there is ample opportunity to research organisations’ response to the pandemic and CSR as a strong arm to deal with critical disasters. Practical implications: The paper offers new insights into exploring research and praxis agenda for collaborative potentials towards the evolution of CSR and sustainability. Social implications: The findings develop new initiatives and combat manifold issues of education, employment and hunger during the pandemic to provide quick relief. Originality/value: The paper offers new insights into how companies are considering issues related to the crisis, including avoidance of layoffs and maintaining wage payments, and may be in a better position to access fresh capital, relief programs and emergency funds. Taking proactive health and safety measures may avert legal risks to the company. It is likely that the way in which companies are responding to the crises is a real-life test on resilience and adaptation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"This commentary approaches the question of whether there is or should be a law and humanities canon through John Guillory’s analysis of canon formation as an adjunct to specific forms of literacy and their perceived social value within “school culture.” Returning to the law and literature movement, with a focus on literature, this essay contends that in order to determine what should be in a canon, law and humanities must first revisit its aims and objectives, link what it reads to pedagogical goals, and draw clearer connections between teaching and scholarship. As the field’s texts modernize and diversify, so too should the literacies students need to engage with them. © The Author(s) 2019."
"The 'free' business model prevails in mobile apps available through the major channels, hinting at the possibility that users 'pay' for the use of the mobile apps by sharing their private data with the developers and platform providers. Several types of personal data and permissions of mobile applications were analyzed. We examined 636 apps in several categories, such as medical, health & fitness, business, finance, and entertainment. The types of personal data being requested by the apps were collected from their privacy policies and the list of permissions was scraped from the platform's store. We implemented a privacy policy word processing algorithm, the purpose of which was to gain a better insight into the types of data collected. Using the algorithm results, we also performed statistical analyses, based on which we found, expectedly, that free mobile applications collect more data than paid ones. However, there are discrepancies between the permissions we obtained from the privacy policy texts and those stated on the Google Play and Apple App Store websites. More permission requirements emerged from the privacy policy texts than were shown on corresponding app stores, which is a worrying result. © 2023 The authors and IOS Press."
"To assess—from a qualitative perspective—the perceptions and attitudes of Spanish rehabilitation professionals (e.g. rehabilitation doctors, speech therapists, physical therapists) about Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) technology. A qualitative, exploratory and descriptive study was carried out by means of interviews and analysis of textual content with mixed generation of categories and segmentation into frequency of topics. We present the results of three in-depth interviews that were conducted with Spanish speaking individuals who had previously completed a survey as part of a larger, 3-country/language, survey on BCI perceptions. 11 out of 15 of these Spanish respondents (survey) either strongly or somewhat accept the use of BCI in rehabilitation therapy. However, the results of our three in-depth interviews show how, due to a strong inertia of attitudes and perceptions about BCI technology, most professionals feel reluctant to use BCI technology in their daily practice (interview). © 2021, The Author(s)."
"Healthcare systems are under pressure from an aging population, rising costs, and increasingly complex conditions and treatments. Although data are determined to play a bigger role in how doctors diagnose and prescribe treatments, they struggle due to a lack of time and an abundance of structured and unstructured information. To address this challenge, we introduce MediCoSpace, a visual decision-support tool for more efficient doctor-patient consultations. The tool links patient reports to past and present diagnoses, diseases, drugs, and treatments, both for the current patient and other patients in comparable situations. MediCoSpace uses textual medical data, deep-learning supported text analysis and concept spaces to facilitate a visual discovery process. The tool is evaluated by five medical doctors. The results show that MediCoSpace facilitates a promising, yet complex way to discover unlikely relations and thus suggests a path toward the development of interactive visual tools to provide physicians with more holistic diagnoses and personalized, dynamic treatments for patients.  © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."
"Objective During a review on postpartum hemorrhage, we identified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of one author conducted at the same time and place for the same condition, with large differences in baseline characteristics. We assessed the data integrity of the RCTs of this author. Study Design We undertook a focused analysis of the data integrity of all RCTs published by Dr. Ahmed M. Maged. We examined the studies for clinical logic and made pairwise comparisons of baseline characteristics and outcomes between trials. We used mathematical methods to assess whether the distribution of baseline characteristics was compatible with chance. Results Between March 2015 and December 2019, Dr. Maged published 22 RCTs (n = 3,722). The median number of participants randomized per center per month was 32 (range = 1-89). Fifteen studies were either not or retrospectively registered, with one study registered 1 year after publication. One study was submitted for publication prior to the completion of the described study period. There were many unusual findings in the studies, including biologically implausible occurrences such as the absence of an association between gestational age and birthweight in seven studies and very different body mass index between three trials, which ran at the same time in the same hospital on the same topic as well as unlikely occurrences such as limited participant drop outs. One paper contained considerable text duplication and identical data to that in a paper published by a different author group from a different hospital, with both papers submitted at the same time. Mathematical analysis of the baseline characteristics of all 22 trials indicated that at least some of the reported baseline characteristics were unlikely to be the result of proper randomization. Conclusion Our analyses of the 22 RCTs of Dr. Maged suggest potential data integrity issues in at least some of them. We suggest that journals investigate according to the Committee on Publication Ethics guidelines. The procedures demonstrated in this paper may help to assess data integrity in future attempts to verify the authenticity of published RCTs. Key Points We identified a number of findings biologically implausible in RCTs by Maged. Monte Carlo simulation found pooled data of Maged RCTs were unlikely result of proper randomization. Textual overlap and almost identical data were found between a Maged paper and another paper. The methods we described may be useful for future efforts in validating scientific data integrity.  © 2021. Thieme. All rights reserved."
"Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the role of collagen cross-linkers in the bonding performance of the resin-dentin interface through a systematic review and a network meta-analysis. Sources: The literature search was conducted in several databases like PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, Scopus and Web of Science from their inception till 30 April 2022. Study selection: The inclusion criteria consisted of in vitro studies evaluating the micro-tensile and micro-shear bond strengths of different cross-linkers acting on dentin. Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using RStudio. Data: Out of the 294 studies evaluated in the full-text analysis, 40 were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. Most studies have used cross-linkers as primer (65.1%), followed by incorporating them into in adhesives and acid etching agents. The application methods of the adhesive system were classified as “etch-and-rinse (ER) adhesives” (77%) and “self-etching (SE) adhesives”. Moreover, there were six types of cross-linkers in this presented review, of which the most numerous were polyphenols. Conclusion: Different application methods of cross-linkers, the long-term results showed that were only effective when used for longer durations, the immediate results were not statistically different. According to immediate and long-term results, etch-and-rinse (ER) adhesives showed a greater bonding performance than the control groups (p ≤ 0.05), whereas self-etching (SE) adhesives showed similar bond strength values (p ≥ 0.05). The result of network meta-analysis (NMA) showed that Dope like compound showed higher long-term bonding performance than other cross-linkers. Clinical significance: Long-term clinical studies may be needed to determine the effect of the cross-linkers on the bonding properties. Copyright © 2023 Chen, Sun, Wang, Yu, Tian and Zhu."
"Discourse structure is generally represented as hierarchical structure, the two most well known representations are rhetorical structure theory (RST) and Penn discourse treebank (PDTB). The main problem of the hierarchical structure is that it can not describe the direct semantic relevance between the elementary discourse units (EDU), especially the non-adjacent and cross-level EDUs. Discourse dependency structure (DDS) has been put forward in recent years to describe the head-dependent relation between the EDUs. However, the judgment process of the head can not be answered theoretically. This problem is particularly serious in Chinese discourse analysis, because Chinese lacks the form differences between the main clauses and the subordinate clauses. In this paper, we propose clause relevance structure to represent the discourse structure. Compared with the hierarchical discourse structure and DDS, the clause relevance structure can effectively describe the direct semantic association between discontinuous and cross-level clauses in a text, and the construction of structure is not presupposed by the head recognition. We propose the judgment criteria and formal constraints of the clause relevance structure, and built a human-annotated corpus on Chinese text. Based on the Chinese corpus, we explore the automatic recognition of clause relevance structure. The clause relevance recognition task is formalized as a classification problem and performed by the BERT-based model. A bidirectional LSTM layer is added on the top of the BERT to improve the performance, and the recognition accuracy (90.77%) is achieved by the BERT-LSTM model. Experimental results show that the long distance clause pairs are the main difficulties in the clause relevance recognition, and these difficulties mainly focus on the positive examples, while the clause pairs with short distance are especially difficult to be correctly recognized as negative relevance. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"In recent years, due to the prevalence of online textual advertisements, increasing businesses recognize their huge potential in product promotion. The high-quality textual content has been empirically shown to have a substantial impact on consumers' attitudes and decisions. As a result, persuasive tactics play an essential role in online textual advertisements, which are employed to increase the attractiveness, and sequentially increase the conversion rate and sales volume. As the context of persuasion, product attributes, e.g., category and price, also greatly influence the persuasion outcomes. However, they are largely overlooked by existing works. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to study context-aware persuasion by designing a multi-task learning model and performing extensive causal analysis. First, the prediction model recognizes the persuasive tactics employed in an advertising text and predicts their promotion effectiveness. Specifically, we design a disentangled representation learning algorithm to capture the persuasive tactics, and then develop a novel context-aware attention module to model the relationships between persuasive tactics and product attributes. Experiments on a large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model over state-of-the-art baselines. Then we show its great practical value by conducting an in-depth causal analysis of context-aware results that our model learns, which offers insightful interpretations and guidelines for marketers to employ persuasive tactics in textual advertisements. © 1989-2012 IEEE."
"While quantitative survey design represents a default research method in the field of hospitality and tourism, qualitative approaches remain largely sidelined. This is particularly true for netnography, a novel method of scientific enquiry that targets the online interactions of various actors. The present chapter seeks to introduce the netnographic approach, outline its implementation in hospitality and tourism, as well as demarcate it from other methods, such as survey, text mining and content analysis. By giving an overview of recent studies employing netnography, the chapter demonstrates applied examples of ethnographic research online, presents a cross-cultural study on disappointing travel experiences and suggests further research avenues, such as cross-cultural investigation. It concludes by discussing strengths and weaknesses of the netnographic approach. The value of this chapter lies in its reflection of state-of-the-art research in hospitality and tourism based on netnography and the proposition of further directions of research. © 2023 by Irina Valerie Gewinner.

"In the current age of enhanced environmental awareness, transformation to sustainable management in the construction sector is needed. China currently produces the largest amount of construction and demolition (C&D) waste around the world, but the average recovery rate of the waste was only about 5% in 2017. In order to investigate problems in current C&D waste management in China, a cross-national comparative analysis is conducted among China and seven selected countries (Japan, South Korea, Germany, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom), to compare legal texts of national policies and laws which relate to C&D waste management and are currently being used. Through the comparison, problems in management of C&D waste in China are investigated. The problems could be concluded to: (a) inadequate guidance on recycling, (b) lack of market incentives in utilising recycled materials, (c) incomplete knowledge of stakeholders’ responsibilities, (d) lack of penalty for other stakeholders, and (e) inefficient supervision system. By understanding these problems, this paper further provides recommendations to enhance the performance of C&D waste management in China. © 2023 The Author(s).

"High dimensional data are rapidly growing in many different disciplines, particularly in natural language processing. The analysis of natural language processing requires working with high dimensional matrices of word embeddings obtained from text data. Those matrices are often sparse in the sense that they contain many zero elements. Sparse principal component analysis is an advanced mathematical tool for the analysis of high dimensional data. In this paper, we study and apply the sparse principal component analysis for natural language processing, which can effectively handle large sparse matrices. We study several formulations for sparse principal component analysis, together with algorithms for implementing those formulations. Our work is motivated and illustrated by a real text dataset. We find that the sparse principal component analysis performs as good as the ordinary principal component analysis in terms of accuracy and precision, while it shows two major advantages: faster calculations and easier interpretation of the principal components. These advantages are very helpful especially in big data situations. © 2020, The Author(s)."
"In this paper, we proposed a two-phase project on emotion corpus creation based on multi-knowledge of cognitive semantics, discourse analysis, paralinguistics, and computer science. Data were gathered from Thai lexicon of five main Thai dictionaries and thesaurus, in addition to written and spoken texts of people with depression in Thai and facial expression with speech situation. We found that semantic primes and features of each emotion were needed to serve as a guideline of emotion categorization in Thai context. We introduced the step-by-step methods of the first phase to create Thai emotion corpus entailing both verbal and nonverbal corpora. The way to classify emotion corpus by focusing on the specific text of depression as well as to find the guidelines of labelling facial expression in the situation of specific emotions was explored. Lastly, the step of creating emotion corpus in the second phase was introduced with some suggestions and discussion. © 2023 The authors and IOS Press."
"ChatGPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is a chatbot that is being widely used by the public. This technology is based on Artificial Intelligence and is capable of having conversational interactions with its users just like humans, but in the form of automated text. Because of this capability, online forums such as Brainly and the like can be overtaken by these smart chatbots. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the positive and negative sentiments towards ChatGPT using Naive Bayes Classification algorithm on 5000 Twitter users. Data was collected by scraping technique and Python programming language was used in data analysis. The results showed that the majority of Twitter users had a positive sentiment of 57,6 % towards ChatGPT, while the negative sentiment reached 42,4 %. The resulting classification model had an accuracy of 80 %, indicating a good classification model in determining sentiment probabilities. These findings provide a basis for the development of better AI chatbot technology that can meet user needs. The results of this study provide insights into user sentiment towards ChatGPT and can be used as a reference for future AI chatbot development. © Este es un artículo en acceso abierto."
"Background: Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) continue to be overrepresented in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United States. HIV prevention and care interventions that are tailored to an individual’s serostatus have the potential to lower the rate of new infections among GBMSM. Mobile technology is a critical tool for disseminating targeted messaging and increasing uptake of basic prevention services including HIV testing, sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing, and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Mobile Messaging for Men (M-Cubed) is a mobile health HIV prevention intervention designed to deliver video- and text-based prevention messages, provide STI and HIV information, and link GBMSM to prevention and healthcare resources. The current report describes an iterative process of identifying and selecting publicly available videos to be used as part of the M-Cubed intervention. We also conducted interviews with GBMSM to assess the acceptability, comprehension, and potential audience reach of the selected video messages. Methods: The selection of videos included balancing of specific criteria [e.g., accuracy of scientific information, video length, prevention domains: HIV/STI testing, antiretroviral therapy (ART), PrEP, engagement in care, and condom use] to ensure that they were intended for our GBMSM audiences: HIV-negative men who engage in condomless anal sex, HIV-negative men who do not engage in condomless anal sex, and men living with HIV. This formative study included in-person interviews with 26 GBMSM from three U.S. cities heavily impacted by the HIV epidemic—New York City, Detroit, and Atlanta. Results: Following a qualitative content analysis, the study team identified five themes across the interviews: participant reactions to the video messages, message comprehension, PrEP concerns, targeting of video messaging, and prompted action. Conclusions: Study results informed a final selection of 12 video messages for inclusion in a randomized controlled trial of M-Cubed. Findings may serve as a guide for researchers who plan to develop HIV prevention interventions that utilize publicly available videos to promote behavioral change. Further, the findings presented here suggest the importance of developing videos with broad age and gender diversity for use in interventions such as M-Cubed, and in other health promotion settings. © mHealth.

"This study develops a new text-as-data method for organization identification, based on word embedding. We introduce and apply the method to identify identity-based nonprofit organizations, using the U.S. nonprofits’ mission and activity information reported in the IRS Form 990s in 2010–2016. Our results show that such method is simple but versatile. It complements the existing dictionary-based approaches and supervised machine learning methods for classification purposes and generates a reliable continuous measure of document-to-keyword relevance. Our approach provides a nonbinary alternative for nonprofit big data analyses. Using word embedding, researchers are able to identify organizations of interest, track possible changes over time and capture nonprofits’ multi-dimensionality. © 2021, International Society for Third-Sector Research."
"Importance: Social needs interventions aim to improve health outcomes and mitigate inequities by addressing health-related social needs, such as lack of transportation or food insecurity. However, it is not clear whether these studies are reducing racial or ethnic inequities. Objective: To understand how studies of interventions addressing social needs among multiracial or multiethnic populations conceptualize and analyze differential intervention outcomes by race or ethnicity. Evidence Review: Sources included a scoping review of systematic searches of PubMed and the Cochrane Library from January 1, 1995, through November 29, 2021, expert suggestions, and hand searches of key citations. Eligible studies evaluated interventions addressing social needs; reported behavioral, health, or utilization outcomes or harms; and were conducted in multiracial or multiethnic populations. Two reviewers independently assessed titles, abstracts, and full text for inclusion. The team developed a framework to assess whether the study was ""conceptually thoughtful"" for understanding root causes of racial health inequities (ie, noted that race or ethnicity are markers of exposure to racism) and whether analyses were ""analytically informative"" for advancing racial health equity research (ie, examined differential intervention impacts by race or ethnicity). Findings: Of 152 studies conducted in multiracial or multiethnic populations, 44 studies included race or ethnicity in their analyses; of these, only 4 (9%) were conceptually thoughtful. Twenty-one studies (14%) were analytically informative. Seven of 21 analytically informative studies reported differences in outcomes by race or ethnicity, whereas 14 found no differences. Among the 7 that found differential outcomes, 4 found the interventions were associated with improved outcomes for minoritized racial or ethnic populations or reduced inequities between minoritized and White populations. No studies were powered to detect differences. Conclusions and Relevance: In this review of a scoping review, studies of social needs interventions in multiracial or multiethnic populations were rarely conceptually thoughtful for understanding root causes of racial health inequities and infrequently conducted informative analyses on intervention effectiveness by race or ethnicity. Future work should use a theoretically sound conceptualization of how race (as a proxy for racism) affects social drivers of health and use this understanding to ensure social needs interventions benefit minoritized racial and ethnic groups facing social and structural barriers to health.. © 2023 American Medical Association.

"Both personality and contexts may account for media multitasking in the college classroom. As this area of research was lacking, the present study examined which personality traits would be associated with in-class media multitasking in different contexts of text messaging. Undergraduate students (83 males and 65 females; average age: 20.0 [SD = 4.3]) completed a questionnaire on demographic characteristics, general text-messaging behavior, and Big Five personality traits as well as a delay-discounting task. This task had two hypothetical scenarios in which participants received either an urgent text message from their significant other (Significant Other condition) or a non-urgent message from a casual friend (Casual Friend condition), and they rated their likelihood of immediately replying to the message during the class versus waiting to reply until the class was over. For each of the conditions, hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to examine whether personality traits predicted the likelihood of waiting, after controlling for demographic characteristics and general text-messaging behavior. Whereas only conscientiousness independently predicted the likelihood of waiting in the Significant Other condition (β =.20, p =.033), only agreeableness independently predicted the likelihood in the Casual Friend condition (β =.27, p =.002). These findings contribute to the sparse literature on links of personality traits and in-class media multitasking by highlighting the possible context-dependent aspects of these links. The findings also indicate potential directions of future research including exploring approaches to reducing media multitasking in the college classroom while taking both personality and specific contexts into consideration. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Introduction Climate change constitutes a major threat to human health. Nurses have an essential role to play in protecting populations from this threat, and to fulfil this role, they must be properly prepared. The purpose of this scoping review is to examine studies on the integration of climate change into the academic curriculum or continuing education of nurses so as to identify issues and opportunities related to this integration. Methods and analysis The method being used is the methodological framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley and Levac et al. First, a search strategy using keywords and their combinations will be developed. This strategy will be applied in four bibliographic databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science. Second, an initial selection of studies based on titles and abstracts will be carried out by two members of the research team using the software Covidence. They will conduct this selection process independently, with the aim of identifying relevant studies that meet the inclusion criteria for our scoping review. Third, the second stage in the selection process will be carried out by examining the full text of each article to determine which studies to include in the review. Finally, data on year of publication, authors, geographical area, article type, study objectives, methodology and key findings will be extracted from selected articles for analysis. A search of the grey literature will also be conducted to supplement the results of the bibliographic database search. The scoping review is currently ongoing. Identification of relevant literature began in the first quarter of 2022 and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2023. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required for this review. The results of this study will be presented in workshops and conferences and be submitted for publication to a peer-reviewed journal. © 2023 Author(s). Published by BMJ."
"Background: Nonunion is a postoperative complication after ankle arthrodesis (AA), which leads to increased morbidity and revision rates. Previous studies have identified risk factors for nonunion following AA, but no meta-analysis has been performed to stratify risk factors based on strength of evidence. Methods: Abstracts and full-text articles were screened by 2 independent reviewers. Relevant data were extracted from the included studies. Random effects meta-analyses were summarized as forest plots of individual study and pooled random effect results. Results: Database search yielded 13 studies involving 987 patients were included, and 37 potential risk factors for nonunion. Meta-analysis found 5 significant risk factors for nonunion post-AA. Strong evidence supports male gender (OR: 1.96; 95% CI: 1.13-3.41), smoking (OR: 2.89; 95% CI: 1.23-6.76), and history of operative site infection prior to arthrodesis (OR: 2.40; 95% CI: 1.13-5.09) as predictors for nonunion following AA. There was moderate evidence supporting history of open injury (OR: 5.95; 95% CI: 2.31-15.38) and limited evidence for preoperative avascular necrosis (OR: 13.16; 95% CI: 2.17-79.61) as possible risk factors for nonunion. Conclusion: The results of our meta-analysis suggest that male gender, smoking, and history of operative site infection have strong evidence and that history of open injury and avascular necrosis also have evidence as risk factors for nonunion. Surgeons should be cognizant of these risks when performing AA and closely follow up with patients with the aforementioned risk factors to ensure postoperative success.

"Among the thousands of Tibetan manuscripts related to the Bon religion that have come to light in China's Gansu and Sichuan provinces in recent years is a work entitled Then yul rgyas pa'i klu 'bum (PLB), the 'Extensive collection from Phenyul concerning the klu'. The text, which is a collection of myths and rituals relating to the klu spirits that are sometimes conflated with the Indic naga (serpent spirits), is part of the repertoire of a class of Bon priests known as le'u. The importance of the Klu Collection to Tibetan religion is illustrated by the fact that it is the only Bon work that is also used by Buddhists. Apart from a few pioneering studies - two of them dating to the nineteenth century - very little research has been carried out on the Klu Collection. The PLB is one of two recensions of a hitherto unstudied version of the Collection, of which the other appears in the Bon Canon. This article focuses on the PLB manuscript recension. The manuscript contains a number of archaic and local codicological features, while an analysis of its contents suggests that it is an older version than that found in the Bon Canon, which contains quasi-Buddhist features that may have been introduced with a view to aligning it with 'monastic' Bon orthodoxy. © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter.

"Aceh has the most enduring legacy of successful female leaders in the world. The situation has changed during the past few decades, as fewer women hold crucial government positions. This paper traced the history of women and their role in Aceh through colonial and post-colonial contexts from the early years of this century to the present day. This study also examined the role and contributions made by the Acehnese women through the women's movement and their participation in political life, as well as the reasons for the lack of women appointed as policymakers, as indicated by multiple studies on this topic. A qualitative library research method was employed, and the data from text documents were analyzed using critical discourse analysis. The research showed that women in Aceh continued to play an essential role in the public domain and made significant contributions through the movement. However, The lack of opportunity for women to occupy their position as policymakers were influenced by diverse issues ranging from the patriarchal culture in Aceh, the inability of a political party to cadre women, to the misconception of people in interpreting religious belief that women should not be allowed to be a leader.

"Objective This study aimed to evaluate the perceived quality of life, unmet needs and psychological distress in patients with head and neck cancer in a rural setting in New Zealand. Method Patients presenting with head and neck cancer in Northland, New Zealand, were asked to complete questionnaires on quality of life, unmet needs, and anxiety or depression together with a free-text option. Results About one quarter of respondents (27 per cent) scored high in the anxiety and depression scale, with corresponding diminished quality of life scores and increased needs. Over half of respondents (54 per cent) found it challenging to travel for treatment. Financial difficulties were encountered more frequently with indigenous patients. Rurality alone does not lead to significant differences in quality of life or needs. Conclusion After treatment for head and neck cancer, it is important to monitor and manage patients' psychological distress and ease of access to health services to improve quality of life.

"Aspect-level sentiment analysis aims to determine the sentiment polarity towards a specific target in a sentence. The main challenge of this task is to effectively model the relation between targets and sentiments so as to filter out noisy opinion words from irrelevant targets. Most recent efforts capture relations through target-sentiment pairs or opinion spans from a word-level or phrase-level perspective. Based on the observation that targets and sentiments essentially establish relations following the grammatical hierarchy of phrase-clause-sentence structure, it is hopeful to exploit comprehensive syntactic information for better guiding the learning process. Therefore, we introduce the concept of Scope, which outlines a structural text region related to a specific target. To jointly learn structural Scope and predict the sentiment polarity, we propose a hybrid graph convolutional network (HGCN) to synthesize information from constituency tree and dependency tree, exploring the potential of linking two syntax parsing methods to enrich the representation. Experimental results on five public datasets illustrate that our HGCN model outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines. More specifically, the average accuracy/ F1 score improvements of our HGCN compared to baseline models on Restaurant 14, 15 and 16 are 2.46%/5.36%, 2.25%/5.70% and 1.73%/5.50%, while the performance improvements are 3.32%/4.30% and 2.50%/3.08% on the Laptop and Twitter datasets, respectively. Furthermore, when cascaded to five models, our method has significantly improved their performances by simplifying the sentence from multiple targets to a single one. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Background: The global COVID-19 pandemic has posed a major threat to human life and health, and new media technologies have intensified the spread of risk perception. Purpose: This study aimed to explore the impact of risk information ground on online users’ perceived health risks, and further explore the mediating role of psychological distance and the moderating role of self-efficacy. Methods: A total of 25 Internet users from different provinces in China were interviewed in-depth, NVIVO.11 was used to qualitatively analyze the interview text data and construct a theoretical model. A total of 492 interviewees were recruited in order to complete a scenario questionnaire, SPSS-27 was used to perform orthogonal experiments, generate eight combinatorial scenarios, analyze demographic data, and clean and prepare data for testing hypotheses. SmartPLS 3.0 was used to test the conceptual model using the structural equation model (SEM) of the partial least squares (PLS). Results: The analysis of the SEM model shows that all planned hypotheses (Information fluency → Information diagnosability, Information extensibility → Information diagnosability, Information diagnosability → Psychological distance, Platform interactivity → Scenario embeddedness, Network connectivity → Scenario embeddedness, Scenario embeddedness → Psychological distance, Psychological distance → Risk perception, Psychological distance → Self-efficacy → Risk perception, Information fluency → Information diagnosability → Psychological distance → Risk perception, Information extensibility → Information diagnosability → Psychological distance → Risk perception, Platform interactivity → Scenario embeddedness → Psychological distance → Risk perception, Network connectivity → Scenario embeddedness → Psychological distance → Risk perception) are confirmed. Conclusion: This study found that the information ground factors significantly affect online users’ perceptions of health risks, psychological distance mediates the effect of information ground factors on risk perception, and self-efficacy negatively moderates the effect of psychological distance on risk perception.

"[Objective] This paper analyzes the differences of course assessments between Chinese and American universities, aiming to provide empirical support for engineering education reforms. [Methods] First, we retrieved more than 47, 000 valid computer science related Chinese and English syllabi through automated data crawling. Then, we extracted the assessment section of these syllabi by keywords. Finally, we compared and analyzed the contents and methods of these assessments quantitatively. [Results] Compared with courses from Chinese universities, American universities assessed their students with more categories and diversified contents. American universities attach great importance to students’progress, while Chinese universities focus too much on final exams. [Limitations] There is limited number of Chinese syllabi available online. Many syllabi contain much unstructured textual data, therefore, errors might occur while using keywords to examine their contents. [Conclusions] This study provides empirical support for course assessment optimization in China. © 2023, Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved."

"Owing to continuous cyberattacks, a large amount of threat intelligence is generated online every day. However, threat intelligence is mostly unstructured and multisource heterogeneous text. It is difficult for security analysts to understand the implicit threat in time. Knowledge Graph (KG) is an important research topic in recent years, which can perform automated and real-time analysis of threat intelligence in cybersecurity. As one of the critical technologies of KG, named entity recognition (NER) can identify cyberattack-related entities. It has been proved that long-distance structured information captured by dependency trees provides a rich semantic expression for the neural network. However, existing research works are more focused on the simple linear stack of neural networks when utilizing structured features. The interaction between different types of neural networks is vague. In addition, the existing models are insensitive to the boundaries of complex entity terms in cybersecurity. In this study, we propose a new feature integration and entity boundary detection (FIEBD) model. In our model, a new pretrained language model, PERT, is applied to obtain word embedding of cyber texts. Moreover, a novel neural network cell, namely GARU, is developed to incorporate different types of features extracted from graph neural networks and recurrent neural networks. It combines the graph encoder with the gate mechanism, aiming to obtain better hidden representation by explicit interaction. Furthermore, considering a large number of complex entities in cybersecurity, we contribute an entity boundary detection module to perform entity head and tail prediction as an augmentation task. We conduct extensive experiments on cybersecurity datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves better performance than existing baseline methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Internet-based resource, which includes social forums, review sites, blogs and networks generates enormous heaps of data in the form of views, users' feelings, thoughts, and disagreements on numerous things like brands, politics, and social events. This data can be found in the form of ""user-generated content."" The feelings of people who express themselves online have a significant impact not just on readers but also on those who sell products and on politicians. It is necessary to assess and well-structure the digital evidence that comes through social networks and websites, and sentiment analysis has attracted a lot of attention for this use. Sentiment analysis or text organization, is used to categorize the conveyed mentality or feelings in numerous ways, such as affirmative, favorable, unpleasant, thumbs up, hand gestures, negative, etc. Sentimental evaluation is also referred to as a ""thumbs up"" or ""thumbs down"" rating. Within the realm of natural language processing, the problem of insufficiently labeled data presents a hurdle for sentiment analysis. And as a solution to this problem, the techniques of sentiment analysis and deep learning have been combined. This was done using deep learning models because of their ability to automatically learn new information. Therefore, this paper integrated the deep learning approach for domain-independent sentiment analysis. The paper presents an Attention based Emotion-Embedding BiLSTM-GRU Network for sentiment analysis. The paper presents comparative training accuracy and loss analysis with four baseline models. The network shows an accuracy of 93% which is higher as compared to baseline models and also achieved predictive accuracy compared to cutting-edge models. © 2023, ScienceIn Publishing.

"Women’s voices have been systematically silenced in society and in literature throughout history. Migrant women authors have suffered a double silencing of their texts, for being both women and migrants. This oppression is usually stronger because of class and gender issues. This article aims at developing a theoretical framework that may be useful for the study of texts written by migrant women due to the specific characteristics of these texts. To this end, the framework is nurtured from feminist literary criticism and postcolonial criticism with the aim of exploring the texts produced by migrant female authors in a holistic way. Likewise, the concept of authorship and the treatment of the possible autobiographical elements contained in the texts will be explored in depth by contrasting the theoretical proposals by Barthes and Foucault. In conclusion, the proposed framework has its roots on the linkage of the basic axes for the analysis of migrant women’s literature, emphasizing the social value of these texts in terms of racism, inequalities, and violence. © 2023, Universidad de Granada.

"Big data analytics can be used by smart cities to improve their citizens' liveability, health, and wellbeing. Social surveys and also social media can be employed to engage with their communities, and these require sophisticated analysis techniques. Twitter and Reddit are ideal social media tools for natural language processing since they have predominantly text-based content. Data from these social media systems can be analysed to provide sentiment on issues of importance in near real-time for decision makers. Techniques such as word clouds can provide initial qualitative analysis while quantitative analysis can produce bar charts and time series of sentiment values. Access to the Twitter and Reddit APIs are described together with analysis techniques using Python libraries. The advantages and disadvantages of this type of analysis are discussed. Social media users tend to be concentrated in the more youthful and socially progressive social cohorts, which may cause bias. © 2023 ACM."
"Marine plastic waste is one of the most difficult global ocean governance issues at present, and is also the focus of marine waste governance in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea region surrounded by China, Japan, and Republic of Korea (ROK). China, Japan, and Republic of Korea (ROK)are now aware of the importance of this issue to their surrounding waters and their country’s development. However,the poor implementation of marine governance gives rise to the unsatisfactory effect of marine plastic waste governance in the sea area. Based on the concept of blue economy and the data of plastic pollution in the Yellow Sea and East China Sea, this paper discusses the feasibility of establishing binding legal norms and policies to promote the progress of marine plastic waste treatment in China, Japan and Republic of Korea. By using research methods of text analysis and status survey, this paper analyzes the differences and common demands of China, Japan and Republic of Korea for marine plastic pollution control. It is concluded that three countries have common demands in the management of the whole life cycle of marine plastic pollution, the establishment of flexible legal instruments, and the participation of stakeholders. Finally, through the case experience of the blue cycle model of marine plastic waste in Taizhou, Zhejiang Province, China, this paper proposes that this model can also be used in the management of marine plastic waste in China, Japan and Republic of Korea. Three countries can gradually promote the cooperation of marine plastic waste laws and regulations by starting with the treatment of\ fishery plastic waste, and innovate the blue cycle model, so as to finally promote the conclusion of the regional marine waste treatment agreement.

"We introduce and assess the use of supervised learning in cross-domain topic classification. In this approach, an algorithm learns to classify topics in a labeled source corpus and then extrapolates topics in an unlabeled target corpus from another domain. The ability to use existing training data makes this method significantly more efficient than within-domain supervised learning. It also has three advantages over unsupervised topic models: the method can be more specifically targeted to a research question and the resulting topics are easier to validate and interpret. We demonstrate the method using the case of labeled party platforms (source corpus) and unlabeled parliamentary speeches (target corpus). In addition to the standard within-domain error metrics, we further validate the cross-domain performance by labeling a subset of target-corpus documents. We find that the classifier accurately assigns topics in the parliamentary speeches, although accuracy varies substantially by topic. We also propose tools diagnosing cross-domain classification. To illustrate the usefulness of the method, we present two case studies on how electoral rules and the gender of parliamentarians influence the choice of speech topics.  © The Author(s) 2021.

"Technologies can greatly improve translators’ productivity and reduce their workload. Previous research has found that the use of automatic speech recognition (ASR) tools for dictating translations can increase productivity. However, these studies often had small sample sizes and did not consider other important aspects of translators’ performance, such as translation quality and cognitive effort. This study aims to investigate the impact of text input method on translators’ performance in terms of task duration, time allocation, editing operations, cognitive effort, and translation quality, as well as whether text difficulty affects these factors. To do this, 60 Chinese translation trainees were randomly assigned to either a dictation group or a typing group, and completed two English-Chinese translations of varying levels of source-text difficulty. Data were collected using keylogging, subjective ratings, screen recording, and a questionnaire. The results showed that using ASR reduced the typing effort of participants without negatively affecting translation quality, but did not save time or reduce cognitive effort. No effect of text difficulty was observed. Analysis of the revisions made by the dictation group and the results of the post-test questionnaire provide insights into how ASR systems can be optimized for translation purposes.

"The COVID-19 public health emergency forced the conversion of in-person SUO fellowship interviews into virtual interviews. We sought to understand applicant perspectives and preferences related to virtual interviews and whether programs should consider virtual interviews in the future. We distributed a survey to 2020 SUO Fellowship interview participants at 4 SUO urologic oncology fellowship programs. Response items were on a Likert scale scored 1–5 with higher scores indicating greater agreement with the survey item construct. Survey responses were collated and thematic mapping used to describe open text responses. Descriptive statistics were used for analysis of survey and open text results. Fifty-eight SUO fellowship applicants completed the survey. Virtual interviews successfully promoted interaction with SUO fellowship program faculty (mean 4.6, SD 0.6), outlined program research opportunities (mean 4.5, SD 0.7), and proffered opportunities to ask questions about the fellowship (mean 4.7, SD 0.5). Applicants exhibited weakly positive orientation to the adequacy of the virtual format (mean 3.5, SD 1.1). 63% of applicants would prefer a virtual format in the future. Qualitative feedback noted the benefits of virtual interviews were lower cost and reduced time away from residency. SUO fellowship applicants exhibited mixed preferences for virtual and in-person interviews. Although virtual fellowship interviews have benefits such as cost savings and time efficiency, notable weaknesses included challenges observing the culture of the programs. Following the pandemic, SUO fellowship programs may consider virtual interviews but should consider incorporating opportunities for informal interactions between faculty, fellows, and fellow applicants. © 2021 Elsevier Inc."

"Purpose: The analysis of multimedia content is being applied in various real-time computer vision applications. In multimedia content, digital images constitute a significant part. The representation of digital images interpreted by humans is subjective in nature and complex. Hence, searching for relevant images from the archives is difficult. Thus, electronic image analysis strategies have become effective tools in the process of image interpretation. Design/methodology/approach: The traditional approach used is text-based, i.e. searching images using textual annotations. It consumes time in the manual process of annotating images and is difficult to reduce the dependency in textual annotations if the archive consists of large number of samples. Therefore, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is adopted in which the high-level visuals of images are represented in terms of feature vectors, which contain numerical values. It is a commonly used approach to understand the content of query images in retrieving relevant images. Still, the performance is less than optimal due to the presence of semantic gap among the image content representation and human visual understanding perspective because of the image content photometric, geometric variations and occlusions in search environments. Findings: The authors proposed an image retrieval framework to generate semantic response through the feature extraction with convolution network and optimization of extracted features using adaptive moment estimation algorithm towards enhancing the retrieval performance. Originality/value: The proposed framework is tested on Corel-1k and ImageNet datasets resulted in an accuracy of 98 and 96%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Deaf and hard of hearing students can control the concept of science and learn more when learning is presented in a real-world context. Students with deaf and hard of hearing can understand science process skills by applying appropriate learning models supported by good facilities. The current literature review aims to provide an overview of learning models and media that can improve the understanding of science concepts in deaf and hard of hearing students. A three-step literature review method was used: selection, analysis, and categorizations of the articles. The results show that the project approach, contextual, Picture and Picture, and inquiry learning model can improve conceptual understanding and learning outcomes of Deaf and Hard of Hearing students. On the other hand, visual media Schedule, multimedia (media that combines text, visuals, and interactive media), Flashcards, virtual reality technology, and mind mapping media can be alternatives for implementing science learning that helps to improve students' understanding of the concept of hearing impairment. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

"This paper explores thumb-typing as a cultural technique stemming from the mutual development of typing interfaces and practices. Focusing on the work of the typing fingers, it examines how the assignment of thumbs to be the primary writing digits is an innovation that correlates—and in some respects causes—textual and social changes that are central to digital culture. It argues that thumb-typing embodies recursive relations between behavioral patterns, technological infrastructure, and textual creation. The analysis shows how the invention of the typewriter keyboard introduced the fingers to typing, and how developments of digital media refined the finger-work in interacting with the device, resulting in thumb-typing. The new functionality of the thumb as an executing rather than supporting finger, promotes a novel equivalency and interchangeability in finger employment to typing. This, I propose, problematizes traditional concepts of textuality, its performance, and authorship. © The Author(s) 2021."
"Introduction: The administration of blood products becomes an advantageous tool in the treatment of coagulopathy and serves as a transfusion guide in patients with liver disease requiring transplantation, to reduce the administration of blood products and improve post-transplant results. Objective: Interpret Nursing care and the protocol to follow in the administration of blood products. Methods: Exploratory reflection study, carried out in 2022, supported by hermeneutics to interpret the bibliographic review carried out in the SciELO, Medigraphic and PubMed-MEDLINE databases, 54 articles were identified and 15 that met the criteria were included. selection, be full text, published between 2018 and 2022, in Spanish, English or Portuguese, which include the three levels of care, content analysis was performed to interpret the data. Results: A complete document was not found that supported Nursing care in the administration of blood products, for which reason they were taken from different bibliographic sources. Nor was a national and international consensus on this care identified. Conclusions: The administration of blood products is a procedure carried out by nurses and requires responsibility, meticulous attention to the person and correct application of protocols to prevent complications. It was evidenced that the nurse plays a fundamental role in the administration of blood products since she spends more time with the patient. © 2023, Editorial Ciencias Medicas.

"This systematic review aimed to provide a synthesis of the evidence relating to how the provision of vitamin D supplements influences oral health status. An electronic database search was performed across six databases using a standardised search strategy. The PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) was used to define the review question. The screening and selection followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses process (PRISMA). The quality of reporting was assessed using Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines, and the bias was assessed using the revised Cochrane tool RoB2. A total of 1812 studies were retrieved. 1427 studies were excluded due to unmet inclusion criteria. Full texts of seventy-five potential studies were retrieved and ultimately six studies met the inclusion criteria. There were limitations in the quality of reporting of studies (between 49 % and 73 %). 70 % of the risk of bias items were in the low risks category. Vitamin D interventions varied with respect to dosage and duration. Qualitative syntheses identified significantly better oral health outcomes. Heterogeneity of study design, intervention and outcomes precluded quantitative synthesis. Few clinical trials investigated the effect of vitamin D supplementation on oral health. There is considerable heterogeneity among studies interventions and oral health outcomes. Quality of reporting of studies has limitations and there is evidence of study biases. Nonetheless, qualitative synthesis of the evidence suggests that vitamin D supplements improve oral health outcomes, particularly periodontal health. Calcium may also play a significant role. Further high-quality trials are required of comparable vitamin D supplements with similar oral health outcomes focused to inform quantitative synthesis of the evidence. © The Author(s), 2022.

"Background: Epilepsy is clinically defined as two or more unprovoked epileptic seizures more than 24 hours apart. Given that, a diagnosis of epilepsy can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality, it is imperative that clinicians (and people with seizures and their relatives) have access to accurate and reliable prognostic estimates, to guide clinical practice on the risks of developing further unprovoked seizures (and by definition, a diagnosis of epilepsy) following single unprovoked epileptic seizure. Objectives: 1. To provide an accurate estimate of the proportion of individuals going on to have further unprovoked seizures at subsequent time points following a single unprovoked epileptic seizure (or cluster of epileptic seizures within a 24-hour period, or a first episode of status epilepticus), of any seizure type (overall prognosis). 2. To evaluate the mortality rate following a first unprovoked epileptic seizure. Search methods: We searched the following databases on 19 September 2019 and again on 30 March 2021, with no language restrictions. The Cochrane Register of Studies (CRS Web), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to March 29, 2021), SCOPUS (1823 onwards), ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). CRS Web includes randomized or quasi-randomized, controlled trials from PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and the Specialized Registers of Cochrane Review Groups including Epilepsy. In MEDLINE (Ovid) the coverage end date always lags a few days behind the search date. Selection criteria: We included studies, both retrospective and prospective, of all age groups (except those in the neonatal period (< 1 month of age)), of people with a single unprovoked seizure, followed up for a minimum of six months, with no upper limit of follow-up, with the study end point being seizure recurrence, death, or loss to follow-up. To be included, studies must have included at least 30 participants. We excluded studies that involved people with seizures that occur as a result of an acute precipitant or provoking factor, or in close temporal proximity to an acute neurological insult, since these are not considered epileptic in aetiology (acute symptomatic seizures). We also excluded people with situational seizures, such as febrile convulsions. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors conducted the initial screening of titles and abstracts identified through the electronic searches, and removed non-relevant articles. We obtained the full-text articles of all remaining potentially relevant studies, or those whose relevance could not be determined from the abstract alone and two authors independently assessed for eligibility. All disagreements were resolved through discussion with no need to defer to a third review author. We extracted data from included studies using a data extraction form based on the checklist for critical appraisal and data extraction for systematicreviews of prediction modelling studies (CHARMS). Two review authors then appraised the included studies, using a standardised approach based on the quality in prognostic studies (QUIPS) tool, which was adapted for overall prognosis (seizure recurrence). We conducted a meta-analysis using Review Manager 2014, with a random-effects generic inverse variance meta-analysis model, which accounted for any between-study heterogeneity in the prognostic effect. We then summarised the meta-analysis by the pooled estimate (the average prognostic factor effect), its 95% confidence interval (CI), the estimates of I² and Tau² (heterogeneity), and a 95% prediction interval for the prognostic effect in a single population at three various time points, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. Subgroup analysis was performed according to the ages of the cohorts included; studies involving all ages, studies that recruited adult only and those that were purely paediatric. Main results: Fifty-eight studies (involving 54 cohorts), with a total of 12,160 participants (median 147, range 31 to 1443), met the inclusion criteria for the review. Of the 58 studies, 26 studies were paediatric studies, 16 were adult and the remaining 16 studies were a combination of paediatric and adult populations. Most included studies had a cohort study design with two case-control studies and one nested case-control study. Thirty-two studies (29 cohorts) reported a prospective longitudinal design whilst 15 studies had a retrospective design whilst the remaining studies were randomised controlled trials. Nine of the studies included presented mortality data following a first unprovoked seizure. For a mortality study to be included, a proportional mortality ratio (PMR) or a standardised mortality ratio (SMR) had to be given at a specific time point following a first unprovoked seizure. To be included in the meta-analysis a study had to present clear seizure recurrence data at 6 months, 12 months or 24 months. Forty-six studies were included in the meta-analysis, of which 23 were paediatric, 13 were adult, and 10 were a combination of paediatric and adult populations. A meta-analysis was performed at three time points; six months, one year and two years for all ages combined, paediatric and adult studies, respectively. We found an estimated overall seizure recurrence of all included studies at six months of 27% (95% CI 24% to 31%), 36% (95% CI 33% to 40%) at one year and 43% (95% CI 37% to 44%) at two years, with slightly lower estimates for adult subgroup analysis and slightly higher estimates for paediatric subgroup analysis. It was not possible to provide a summary estimate of the risk of seizure recurrence beyond these time points as most of the included studies were of short follow-up and too few studies presented recurrence rates at a single time point beyond two years. The evidence presented was found to be of moderate certainty. Authors' conclusions: Despite the limitations of the data (moderate-certainty of evidence), mainly relating to clinical and methodological heterogeneity we have provided summary estimates for the likely risk of seizure recurrence at six months, one year and two years for both children and adults. This provides information that is likely to be useful for the clinician counselling patients (or their parents) on the probable risk of further seizures in the short-term whilst acknowledging the paucity of long-term recurrence data, particularly beyond 10 years.

"The rise of social media has offered a fast and easy way for the propagation of conspiracy theories and other types of disinformation. Despite the research attention that has received, fake news detection remains an open problem and users keep sharing articles that contain false statements but which they consider real. In this article, we focus on the role of users in the propagation of conspiracy theories that is a specific type of disinformation. First, we compare profile and psycho-linguistic patterns of online users that tend to propagate posts that support conspiracy theories and of those who propagate posts that refute them. To this end, we perform a comparative analysis over various profile, psychological and linguistic characteristics using social media texts of users that share posts about conspiracy theories. Then, we compare the effectiveness of those characteristics for predicting whether a user is a conspiracy propagator or not. In addition, we propose ConspiDetector, a model that is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) and which combines word embeddings with psycho-linguistic characteristics extracted from the tweets of users to detect conspiracy propagators. The results show that ConspiDetector can improve the performance in detecting conspiracy propagators by 8.82% compared with the CNN baseline with regard to F1-metric. © The Author(s) 2021."
"As the number of non-native English speakers on social media has skyrocketed in recent years, sentiment and emotion analysis on regional languages and code-mixed data has gained traction. Despite extensive research on English, the area of Hindi–English code-mixed texts is still relatively new and understudied. We create an emotion annotated Hindi–English (Hinglish) code-mixed dataset by performing emotion annotation on the benchmark SentiMix dataset to solve this problem and enable future researchers to contribute to this domain. We propose an end-to-end transformer-based multitask framework for sentiment detection and emotion recognition from the SentiMix code-mixed dataset. We fine-tune the pre-trained cross-lingual embedding model, XLMR, using task-specific data to further exploit the efficacy of transfer learning to improve the overall efficiency of our methods. Our proposed multi-task solution outperforms the state-of-the-art single-task and multitask baselines by a considerable margin, implying that the auxiliary task (i.e. emotion recognition) increases the efficiency of the primary task (i.e. sentiment detection) in a multi-task environment. It should be noted that the reported findings were obtained without the use of any ensemble techniques, thereby adhering to a model of effective and production-ready NLP. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Sentiment analysis is a technique for assessing people's opinions and viewpoints based on the text or photos they publish on social networking sites such as Instagram and Twitter. Because it can be difficult to pinpoint the precise thoughts, ideas, and sentiments expressed in a text document or image, sentiment classification is a difficult undertaking. People share their emotions in diverse ways depending on the situation and subject. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid feature extraction and selection technique using numerous deep learning techniques. The features extracted from the image, such as luminance, chrominance, histogram, autoencoder, etc., are validated with a modified convolutional neural network called mCNN. The number of deep CNN layers, size of extracted features, various activation functions, and different optimizers have been used for CNN feeding. In an extensive experimental analysis, our module was tested and compared with two different deep learning modules, such as RESNET and VGGNET. Our proposed module obtains higher accuracy than two conventional deep learning frameworks. © 2023, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved."
"Global Perspectives consider the relationship between literature, language, and perception, as well as how literature and language ‘do’ conflict and complicate notions of mood, emotion, and genre. Lyricism in global narratives has the ability to disrupt time and generate a further expansion of genre. With a short study on the mode of writing by Julio Llamazares and Anne Carson, this article discusses enactive forms of perception, referring to enactive experience as the way to describe a text’s capacity to activate our mental need to attend to a text, disorienting in its form or temporality, and our perception of the realities of the world, including isolation and digital remove. Making a reference to Gumbrecht´s Stimmung and Deleuze´s rhizome, it considers how phenomenology of the present becomes a primordial task after globalization, and how priority is given to developing an analysis which identifies dehumanizing effects in contemporary societies. The article later refers to Martha Nussbaum´s theory of emotion and concludes by recognizing the importance of sensorial perception and emotion in literary studies in the twenty-first century. © 2023, Universidad de Granada.

"When conducting a systematic analysis of the concept of scientific reasoning (SR), we found confusion regarding the definition of the concept, its characteristics and its blurred boundaries with the concept of scientific thinking (ST). Furthermore, some authors use the concepts as synonyms. These findings raised three issues we aimed to answer in the present study: (1) are SR and ST the same concept, (2) if not, what are the differences between them, and (3) how can SR and ST be characterised and operationalised for systematic research? We conducted a conceptual review using an integrative approach to analyse 166 texts. First, we found that thinking and reasoning might refer to different processes. Likewise, SR and ST can be characterised as distinct concepts. Furthermore, the review identified that differences found between the concepts of SR and ST are grounded in ontological and epistemological perspectives. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Research on Russian troll activity during the 2016 US presidential campaign largely focused on divisive partisan messaging. Here, we document the use of apolitical content - content that could counteract mobilization efforts and escape detection in future campaigns. We argue this resembled techniques used by autocratic regimes domestically, in flooding social media with entertainment content to distract from and displace mobilizing messaging. Using automated text analysis and hand coding to construct a timeline of IRA messaging on Twitter, we find left-leaning trolls posted large volumes of entertainment content in their artificial liberal community and shifted away from political content late in the campaign. Simultaneously, conservative trolls were targeting their community with increases in political content. This suggests the use of apolitical content might be an overlooked strategy to selectively manipulate levels of attention to politics.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

"In this technologically advanced world, the existence of online stores, which makes products available to the consumers on their fingertips, it is important for retailers to take feedback on their products by the consumers. Reviewing a product also gives other customers an idea about how good or bad a product could be. Reviews will help the retailers improve their service or their product. Our work aims to automatically analyze the reviews and classify if a review is good or bad using amazon fine food reviews dataset. To classify the reviews as positive or negative, four different kind of classifiers such as logistic regression, support vector machine (SVM), random forest and XGBoost were used. Each classifier was used along with four different vectors such as bag of words, TFIDF, average of word2vec, and a combination of TF-IDF and word2vec. The paper proposes a framework to automate the text analysis of reviews for polarization of its sentiment. The work also emphasizes that for certain datasets, simpler models and simpler featurization gives higher accuracy and performance compared to complex models. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC."
"This study investigates inter- and intracoder reliability, proposing a new approach based on social network analysis (SNA) and exponential random graph models (ERGM). During a recent exit poll, the responses of voters to two open-ended questions were recorded. A coding experiment was conducted where a group of coders coded a sample of text segments. Analyzing the data, we show that the proposed SNA/ERGM method extends significantly our analytical leverage, beyond what popular tools such as Krippendorff’s α and Fleiss’s κ have to offer. The reliability of coding for individual coders differed significantly for the two questions although they were very similar and the same codebook was used. We conclude that the main advantages of the proposed SNA/ERGM method are the intuitive visualizations and the nuanced measurements. Detailed guidelines are provided for practitioners who would like to use the proposed method in operational settings. © The Author(s) 2020."
"Introduction The South African government responded swiftly to the first wave of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) with a nationwide lockdown. Initial restrictions from March-July 2020 required people to stay at home unless accessing essential, life-saving services. We sought to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting lockdowns affected young people's access to sexual and reproductive health services in a high-prevalence HIV setting. Methods We analysed data from a cross-sectional web-based questionnaire conducted with 15-24 year-olds from September-December 2020 in Eastern Cape, South Africa. The questionnaire was promoted through social media platforms. Participants were asked whether and how the COVID-19 pandemic and related restrictions affected their access to sexual and reproductive health services, through closed-ended and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics using proportions were used to summarise responses, and open text was analysed using thematic analysis. Results Of 3431 respondents, the proportions reporting â € more difficulty' accessing HIV testing services, HIV self-screening kits, condoms, pre-exposure prophylaxis and antiretroviral treatment since the COVID-19 pandemic were 16.8%, 13.7%, 13.9%, 11% and 7%, respectively. In 796 open-Text responses, participants described challenges accessing HIV services due to clinics being overwhelmed and prioritising patients with COVID-19, resulting in young people being turned away. Some were afraid of contracting COVID-19 at or en route to clinics. Others were unable to reach clinics because of restricted transport or financial insecurity. Discussion Young people in Eastern Cape rely on local clinics for services, and large proportions of young males and females faced difficulties or fears accessing clinics during the COVID-19 lockdown. Clinics became overwhelmed or inaccessible, limiting young people's access to sexual and reproductive health services. In high HIV risk contexts, prevention services and tools must be more accessible to young people, outside of clinics and within the communities and spaces that young people can access without fear or cost.  © 2023 BMJ Publishing Group.

"Online comments and reviews are the primal exponents of the current era, which needs thorough conceptual discriminations and opinion analysis. Full-text analysis using document classification methods are traditional approach. Deep learning methods are employed on long legal documents for text classification. The word level classification semantically signifies the sense of classification. Statistical methods exist like TF, TF/PDF, and TF/IDF. Document classification is sentence-level classification using sentence vectors mentioned in hitherto successful research consensus. The challenge lies in long legal documents classifying based on the sense in sentences. The article represents challenges in the existing propositions and ideas for implementing long document classification using attention learning. A CNN-based attention learning model is described for classification on BBC Web News datasets. The results are appraised using performance evaluation metrics and RoC graph and have accomplished estimated accuracy of 96%. © 2023, Ismail Saritas. All rights reserved."
"Studies of institutional change identify critical junctures from the position of hindsight. But this perspective prioritises antecedent factors that downplay the role of agency around moments of potential change. This article looks at changes in the ways in which agents use temporal language to identify events or periods as moments of (possible) juncture. It combines quantitative and qualitative methods of text analysis, drawing on a corpus of British parliamentary speeches from 1811–2019. The article first analyses changes in the strategic use of the term crisis over time, paying particular attention to significant shifts in its politicisation and temporalisation. It then identifies three distinct components to the contestation of crises: over their identification, evaluation and proposed prescriptions. We suggest that studies of critical juncture ought to focus more on the use of temporal language around possible junctures to better understand the political dynamics at moments of heightened uncertainty. © John Benjamins Publishing Company."
"Aim: The study purpose was to explore the relationships between family structure and function and adolescent reproductive health in the context of family systems in developing countries. Background: The structures and functions of family are important elements for adolescent reproductive health. However, few studies discuss their relationships with the reproductive health of adolescents. Design: This study employed a scoping review design. Data sources: The search was conducted for literature published from 2010 until 2020 using the electronic databases PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Science Direct sourcing full-text papers in English. Original research papers that focused on family structures, family functions, and adolescent reproductive health were included. Review methods: Data extraction and analysis were completed on all retrieved studies. Content analysis was used for data analysis. Results: Fifteen articles were included. The nature of the relationship between the family structures and functions on adolescent reproductive health were explained in the categories of (i) family process and life cycle, (ii) family norms and values, (iii) family communication patterns and processes, (iv) family roles and connectedness, and (v) family coaching and guidance. Conclusion: Findings of this study suggest that the relationships between family functions and structures and adolescent reproductive health were explained in multiple constructs. Further studies are needed to examine those constructs on reproductive health in adolescent in developing countries. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd."
"Introduction Non-Adherence to antihypertensive therapy is one of the major barriers to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. Several interventions have targeted higher medication adherence, yet most do not result in sustained adherence. Routinisation has emerged as a potential method for mitigating this problem, but requires high motivation during the relatively long habit formation phase. This pilot randomised controlled trial aims to test the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of behavioural economics-based incentives and text messages to support the routinisation of the medication-Taking behaviour for promoting long-Term medication adherence. Methods and analysis This study will recruit and randomly assign 60 adult patients seeking care for hypertension at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles to one of the three groups, Control (n=20), Messages (n=20) and Incentives (n=20) in a 1:1:1 ratio. All participants will receive information about the importance of routinisation and will select an existing behavioural routine (â € anchor') to which they will tie their pill-Taking to, and the corresponding time. Additionally, participants in the Messages group will receive daily text messages reminding them of the importance of routines, while those in the Incentives group will receive daily text messages and conditional prize drawings. The interventions will be delivered over three months. Participants will be followed for six months post-intervention to measure behavioural persistence. Surveys will be administered at baseline, month-3 and month-9 visits. Primary outcomes include: (1) electronically measured mean medication adherence during the intervention period and (2) post-intervention period; and (3) mean timely medication adherence based around the time of the participants' anchor during the intervention period, and (4) post-intervention period. Ethics and dissemination The study was approved by the Cedars-Sinai Institutional Review Board (Study ID: Pro00057764). Findings will be published in scientific peer-reviewed journals.

"With the advent of the information age and technological development, the importance of digital health technologies has increased. Subsequently, nursing informatics has been developed to enhance the effectiveness of healthcare information management and communication. This study aimed to identify the nursing informatics knowledge structure and research trends through quantitative analysis using text network analysis. Here, we analyzed 14 225 studies published by 2020. The knowledge structure of nursing informatics and changes therein were clarified by identifying and analyzing the core keywords, topics, and changes in the topics of related studies over time. We identified ""patient,""""health,""""system,""and ""information""as core keywords connecting other keywords. Over time, the networks between ""information,""""communication,""and ""technology""strengthened, and ""patient safety""and ""quality""have recently emerged as research keywords. This change indicates an increase in the importance of nursing education on technology. Similar changes appeared in the topic analysis, showing an increased proportion of research related to system and technology and nursing education. These results can broaden a systematic understanding of nursing informatics research. Furthermore, given these findings, the importance of nursing informatics on patient safety and nursing education - based on the development of systems and technology - can be expected to continue growing.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."
"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Initially recorded in Yifang Jijie (an ancient Chinese text), Qi Gong Wan (QGW) is used to treat obese women with infertility. QGW can help promote follicular development and maturation, regulate the balance of serum hormones between testosterone and estradiol, enhance endometrial receptivity, improve waist circumference, and ameliorate insulin resistance. It contains eight herbs: Pinellia ternata (Thunb.) Makino (Banxia), Citrus maxima (Burm.) (Juhong), Poria cocos (Schw.) Wolf. (Fuling), Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz (Baizhu), Cyperus rotundus L. (Xiangfu), Conioselinum anthriscoides 'Chuanxiong' (Chuanxiong), Massa Medicata Fermentata (Shenqu), and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch. ex DC. (Gancao). However, the underlying mechanism of how QGW affects women with PCOS remains unclear. Aim of the study: QGW has been widely used to treat PCOS patients with obesity clinically. This study was designed to identify its chemical and pharmacological properties. Materials and methods: Network pharmacology was used to predict the active compounds, potential targets, and pathways of QGW. Female C57BL/6J mice were injected with letrozole and fed a high-fat diet to establish a PCOS-insulin resistance (PCOS-IR) model. Body weight, estrous cycles, ovarian pathology, and serum insulin resistance were measured. qRT-PCR was used to examine the inflammation-related and steroid hormone biosynthesis-related mRNA expression in adipose tissue. Western blotting was used to determine the protein levels of Nrf2, HO-1, and Cyp1b1 in adipose tissue. Molecular docking was used to reveal the key chemical compounds of QGW. Results: Network pharmacology revealed a total of 91 active ingredients in QGW that were associated with 167 targets. QGW could potentially treat PCOS-IR via nitrogen metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and ovarian steroidogenesis pathways. In the PCOS-IR mouse model, we found that QGW decreased the mean diameter of adipocytes and the total adipocyte area. Furthermore, QGW was found to significantly lower the expression of inflammation-related genes including Tnfɑ and C4a/b and the steroid hormone biosynthesis-related gene Cyp1b1. QGW showed a tendency to improve cystic follicles, fasting insulin, and HOMA-IR index in the PCOS-IR mouse model. Combining these findings with the results of KEGG analysis, we conclude that QGW promotes the Nrf2/HO-1/Cyp1b1 pathway to protect adipose tissue under conditions of PCOS. Molecular docking revealed that rutin, nicotiflorin, and baicalein may be the key chemical compounds of QGW through which it improves adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation. Conclusions: QGW improved adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation in the PCOS-IR mouse model by activating the Nrf2/HO-1/Cyp1b1 pathway to protect adipose tissue. Our work thus provides a new research avenue for the study of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of PCOS. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"After their purchase, reviews posted by customers are an important metric that businesses can use to their advantage for product improvement. On e-commerce websites, customers can give star ratings and text reviews. While star ratings sometimes simplify the analysis, the text reviews' detailed sentiment analysis can give deeper insights. This research aims to study the consumer sentiment on mobile phone reviews, their classification into the different star ratings (on a five-point scale), and determine the sentiment's accuracy with the star ratings. To achieve this, first, the data was pre-processed and cleaned. Then the text was translated into their numerical values using word embedding and the TF-IDF feature extraction method. Finally, different algorithms like SVM, Naïve Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, and Ensemble models were used, and performance accuracies were compared. The evaluation metrics used are accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-Score. It is found that a Random Forest classifier with Unigram on a balanced dataset gives better performance. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved."
"Folklore is a term used to refer to the traditions, legends, myths, songs, dances, and other forms of cultural expression of a society or community. These forms of cultural expression are passed down from generation to generation and are an important part of a community’s identity and history. Language is a fundamental part of folklore since it is through language that stories and traditions are transmitted. However, language can also be a form of cultural expression, as each community has its own language or dialect, which can be very different from the official language of the country or region in which it is located. In addition, in the language, there are specific words or phrases that are used only in the context of a community’s folklore, and which can be very important for the transmission and maintenance of their traditions and customs. Considering this, the article presents a detailed analysis of the various approaches to the study of the folklore text as a linguistic object paying particular attention to the structural features of the cumulative text. The main result of the work is that we provide evidence that the study of cumulative folklore texts, in terms of their variability and their functional and stylistic features reveals the universal nature of their organization. © 2023, University of Cienfuegos, Carlos Rafael Rodriguez.

"Bone disease and fractures are among the health issues that are becoming more prevalent year after year. A mandibular disorder is caused by an accident or disease to the largest and strongest bone in the human face. Because the natural healing process of mandibular bones takes a long time, a bone grafting procedure is used to speed up the patient’s recovery. Due to the limitations of bone grafting processes such as autographs, allographs, and xenografts, bone replacement is being developed using biomaterials via 3D printing. The purpose of the review was to evaluate research on the use of 3D printing in the replacement of mandible bones. The search algorithm found as many as 2,941 articles at the start of the search and 123 articles after initial selection. Up to February 2022, the Scopus electronic database was used to conduct the literature search. This research includes publications that employ 3D printers, additive manufacturing, or finite element analysis to build or analyze mandibular implants. Paper topics in engineering, materials science, biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, medicine, dentistry, chemical engineering, and computer science are included in this study. Papers in physics, astronomy, and energy, book chapter document types, papers reviews, and documents in languages other than English were excluded from this study. After an initial screening that included the year, publication stage, source type, and language, as many as 70 articles were obtained, and after filtering titles and abstracts obtained 55 articles. After the full-text selection was obtained, 32 articles were included in this review. Some articles were unacceptable because the topics discussed were unrelated to mandibular bone scaffolds. As a result, the field of additive manufacturing for the repair and reconstruction of mandibular defects necessitates the development of novel tools and methodologies. A customized biological scaffold can be created using an appropriate 3D printing process based on the characteristics of various mandibular defects, allowing it to be perfectly matched to the defect region and reducing stress, thereby improving the scaffold’s healing function.

"There is growing evidence of the comorbidity between personality disorder (PD) and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs). However, there are no systematic reviews including critical appraisal and meta-analyses that identify, evaluate, and synthesize the available evidence on these associations. Therefore, we present here a protocol of the methodology to undertake a systematic review, with the objective to evaluate associations between PD and MSDs in epidemiological population-based studies. A systematic review of observational studies will be conducted. A complete search strategy will be developed in consultation with a health librarian. To identify peer-reviewed literature, the search will be translated for, and implemented in Medline Complete, CINAHL Complete, and PsycINFO via the EBSCOhost platform from 1990 to the present. Gray literature will be identified. Studies will be eligible if they examine general population participants aged 15 years and over. Associations of interest are the presence of threshold or positive screen according to the DSM-V/5 (groupings: any, Clusters A, B, C, specific PD) or ICD-10 for PD in relation to arthritis, back/neck conditions, fibromyalgia, osteopenia/osteoporosis, and/or “any” of these MSDs. Data extraction and critical appraisal will be conducted in line with the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidance for systematic reviews of etiology and risk. The results from all studies will be presented in tables, text, and figures. A descriptive synthesis will present the characteristics of included studies, critical appraisal results, and descriptions of the main findings. Where appropriate, meta-analyses will be performed. If heterogeneity (e.g., I2 = 50%) is detected, subgroup/sensitivity analysis may be used to explore the possible sources. The systematic review does not require ethics approval. The proposed systematic review will strengthen the evidence base on what is known regarding associations between PD and MSDs by identifying, evaluating, and synthesizing the findings of existing observational studies including meta-analyses, where appropriate.

"Sentiment analysis (SA) is information retrieval and computational linguistics that expresses sentiment about a specific document. Recently, research on SA has received greater interests due to the vast expansion of internet data. The comments and reviews posted online creates difficulties to the researchers, because the comments posted are written in unstructured formats with informal expressions, languages and possibly mixed languages. Most of the works on SA have been focusing only on English language but with respect to Indian languages, few works are done, especially on Hindi, Telugu, Bengali, and so forth. SentiWordNet is a useful lexical resource for determining the sentiment of a document or piece of text. There is currently no lexical resource for the Marathi language used for sentiment analysis. Therefore, this proposed research presents SA in one of the languages of Indian origin, that is, Marathi. In this paper, a new method is proposed for the development of a Marathi SentiWordNet (M-SWN), synset-based expansion approach using Marathi WordNet, which consists of Positive, Negative, and Neutral Polarity score, mapped from Hindi-SentiWordNet (H-SWN). Finally, sentiment analysis of movie reviews is carried out using M-SWN using Bi-LSTM based SVM classifier model. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Turkey has been an active member of the Bologna Process (BP) since 2001. This chapter focuses on the impact of the BP on higher education (HE) in Turkey by outlining the reforms that were carried out and the narratives surrounding the changes. The focus of the chapter will be on how the BP has been accommodated, negotiated debated or rejected in Turkey and the societal and political tensions surrounding the process. The chapter is based on the findings of semi-structured interviews conducted with the Bologna experts and the officials of universities in Turkey, who were responsible for the reforms between 2009 and 2016, as well as a review of updated data and the analysis of secondary literature and official texts, such as the National Reports of the BP and the relevant policy documents in Turkey. After a very intense reform process, the policy transfer in Turkey slowed down, and Turkey's discussions, specifically about the BP both at the policy and the university level, became close to non-existent. The chapter aims to analyse the reasons behind the loss of interest in the BP in Turkey by focusing on the critical voices and discussions surrounding the neoliberalisation of HE. The chapter will also refer to how Euroscepticism in Turkey impacted the reform process in HE. © 2023 by Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.."
"Background: Racial/ethnic minorities (REMs) continue to carry the burden of sexual health disparities in the United States, including increased health risks and lower proportions of preventative care. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) has been useful in developing interventions aimed at reducing these disparities. Specifically, partnership with the target group members has resulted in more culturally relevant intervention strategies. Aim: The purpose of this systematic review was to analyze the existing research on sexual health interventions targeting U.S. REMs that were developed using CBPR, to highlight the role target group members played in the development of these interventions, and to explore the benefits and outcomes of these partnerships. Method: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guided the search of 46 thesauri terms for CBPR, sexual health, and REMs across six databases. Results: The initial search yielded 805 identified studies. After applying limiters, reviewing abstracts, and doing a full-text review, 24 appropriate studies were retained. The key findings indicated significant intervention outcomes such as increased health knowledge, attitude change, and behavioral intention that could reduce sexual risk-taking behaviors. Twelve studies detailed the methods for partnering with target group members to formulate interventions, highlighting the benefits related to recruitment, retention, and cultural relevance. Discussion: CBPR is well-positioned to address sexual health disparities among REMs. While community partnership strategies vary, the findings yield evidence that CBPR addressing sexual health disparities is achievable, can influence the effectiveness of interventions, and should be considered as an orientation in future sexual health research. © 2021 Society for Public Health Education."
"Despite the blockchain's considerable potential to solve traditional supply chain problems, research on its deployment in pharmaceutical supply chains (PSC) is sparse. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to provide a conceptual framework for blockchain implementation within the pharmaceutical supply chain. To document the twelve-year research’s, 78 transdisciplinary publications published between 2010 and 2022 were examined using a comprehensive literature review and text mining method. Descriptive and thematic research highlights emerging Blockchain trends in pharmaceutical supply chain. Future research will primarily focus on the use of Blockchain for drug counterfeiting and recall issues, as well as other sector-specific challenges like patient health data sharing, compliance, and clinical trials. The arguments and obstacles for technology acceptance, implementation steps and applications highlighted through the thematic analysis will help build the orientation for the research. Compared to other industries, research on blockchain for PSC has lagged, but it has picked up speed since the Covid-19 pandemic. Researchers and professionals will be guided by the identified influencing factors and implementation roadmap for adopting Blockchain in the pharmaceutical business. The suggested framework is original and offers manufacturers, ministry of health, and private sectors helpful guidelines to Leverage the power of blockchain technology. © 2023 Little Lion Scientific."
"Relation Extraction (RE) is a vital step to complete Knowledge Graph (KG) by extracting entity relations from texts. However, it usually suffers from the long-tail issue. The training data mainly concentrates on a few types of relations, leading to the lack of sufficient annotations for the remaining types of relations. In this paper, we propose a general approach to learn relation prototypes from unlabeled texts, to facilitate the long-tail relation extraction by transferring knowledge from the relation types with sufficient training data. We learn relation prototypes as an implicit factor between entities, which reflects the meanings of relations as well as their proximities for transfer learning. Specifically, we construct a co-occurrence graph from texts, and capture both first-order and second-order entity proximities for embedding learning. Based on this, we further optimize the distance from entity pairs to corresponding prototypes, which can be easily adapted to almost arbitrary RE frameworks. Thus, the learning of infrequent or even unseen relation types will benefit from semantically proximate relations through pairs of entities and large-scale textual information. We have conducted extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets: New York Times and Google Distant Supervision. Compared with eight state-of-the-art baselines, our proposed model achieves significant improvements (4.1 percent F1 on average). Further results on long-tail relations demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned relation prototypes. We further conduct an ablation study to investigate the impacts of varying components, and apply it to four basic relation extraction models to verify the generalization ability. Finally, we analyze several example cases to give intuitive impressions as qualitative analysis. Our codes and data can be found in https://github.com/CrisJk/PA-TRP. © 1989-2012 IEEE."
"Purpose: The importance of management capacity in the health sector has been increasingly recognized. The World Health Organization (WHO) (2008) has claimed that limited “management capacity” in low-income countries is one of the main obstacles toward achieving health-related goals. The aim of this study is to answer the research question: “What are the elements of management and leadership capacity of senior managers from the perspective of senior managers.” Design/methodology/approach: Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted with 20 senior health managers. Sampling method was purposive. Data were collected using a researcher-made interview guide. The transcribed text was analyzed using framework analysis. Findings: Five main themes emerged from the analysis are: (1) competencies required for managers; (2) selection and appointment of managers; (3) establishment of managers' database; (4) deployment of functional support system; and (5) environmental sensitivity. Each of these themes contains sub-themes. Research limitations/implications: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the interviews were conducted virtually. This may have had an impact on obtaining wealthy data because in a face-to-face interview, it is possible to question and answer, get additional explanations and understand the interviewee's mentality. Practical implications: Extracting elements of management and leadership capacity helps managers to assess management capacity and leadership comprehensively and effectively. In addition, effective and useful operations can be done to strengthen the management and leadership capacity. Originality/value: This is the first study that has identified the main elements of management and leadership capacity from the perspective of senior health managers in Iran. This article provides the components of the health system management and leadership capacity that can be used at top management level. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The metabolic activity of all the micro-organism composing the human microbiome interacts with the host metabolism contributing to human health and disease in a way that is not fully understood. Here, we introduce STELLA, a computational method to derive the spectrum of metabolites associated with the microbiome of an individual. STELLA integrates known information on metabolic pathways associated with each bacterial species and extracts from these the list of metabolic products of each singular reaction by means of automatic text analysis. By comparing the result obtained on a single subject with the metabolic profile data of a control set of healthy subjects, we are able to identify individual metabolic alterations.

"There has been a recent shift from person-first to identity-first language to describe autism. In this study, Australian adults who reported having a diagnosis of autism (N = 198) rated and ranked autism-terms for preference and offensiveness, and explained their choice in free-text. ‘Autistic’, ‘Person on the Autism Spectrum’, and ‘Autistic Person’ were rated most preferred and least offensive overall. Ranked-means showed ‘person on the autism spectrum’ was the most preferred term overall. Six qualitative themes reflected (1) autism as core to, or (2) part of one’s identity, (3) ‘spectrum’ reflecting diversity, (4) the rejection of stigmatising and (5) medicalised language, and (6) pragmatics. These findings highlight the importance of inclusive dialogue regarding individual language preference. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to develop an effective approach to support and guide production improvement processes utilising online product reviews. Design/methodology/approach: This paper combines two methods: (1) natural language processing (NLP) to support advanced text mining to increase the accuracy of information extracted from product reviews and (2) quality function deployment (QFD) to utilise the extracted information to guide the product improvement process. Findings: The paper proposes an approach to automate the process of obtaining voice of the customer (VOC) by performing text mining on available online product reviews while considering key factors such as the time of review and review usefulness. The paper enhances quality management processes in organisations and advances the literature on customer-oriented product improvement processes. Originality/value: Online product reviews are a valuable source of information for companies to capture the true VOC. VOC is then commonly used by companies as the main input for QFD to enhance quality management and product improvement. However, this process requires considerable time, during which VOC may change, which may negatively impact the output of QFD. This paper addresses this challenge by providing an improved approach. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"In October 2018, a collaboration between young rap artists in Thailand’s Indy rap scene, Rap Against Dictatorship (RAD), launched a video criticizing the ruling Junta that went viral within days of publication. The Junta soon after released its own video as a response to RAD. The production and publication of both videos are what Scollon (2001) calls social actions mediated by a distinct cultural toolkit. This study analyzed how modes such as music, text, color, camera angle, gestures, voice, image and iconicity emerged in both videos to realize scalar differences in civic participation. The Junta’s video represents a high sociolinguistic scale, whereas RAD realizes a lower scale. In a time of political unrest in Thailand, sociolinguistic scale and the semiotic resources that people employ to realize scales are a lens to analyze how different stakeholders address various perspectives of the political situation and appeal to different levels of civic participation. © John Benjamins Publishing Company."

"The vigorous construction of new power systems entails higher requirements for the efficient and accurate identification technology for power grid monitoring signals. This paper first analyzes the basic principles of the Soft-Masked BERT language model, and establishes a signal text error correction model based on Soft-Masked BERT. According to the typical information table of the State Grid, the rule dictionary of ""signal semantics-grid events"" in normal and fault conditions is analysed. Based on the above models, a power grid situation awareness model based on RNN is established, and a semantic analysis of power grid monitoring signals and a situation awareness solution process based on deep learning are proposed. Finally, taking the actual monitoring signal of a 110 kV substation as the test data, the proposed RNN model is used to analyze the semantic analysis and situation awareness simulation analysis of the monitoring signal of the power grid in this area by combining the Pycorector toolkit and the Pytorch software. The validity and correctness of the model are verified. © 2023 Power System Protection and Control Press. All rights reserved."
"Background: This study aimed to investigate the perceived effect of the RCVS Certificate in Advanced Veterinary Practice (CertAVP) on its graduates, with respect to career advancement, professional practice and contentment with work in the veterinary industry. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey of CertAVP graduates was performed, utilising descriptive analysis of Likert scales, logistic regression of demographic variable associations with key outcomes and free-text analysis. Results: The majority (89%) of the 103 respondents felt that the CertAVP led to improvements in professional practice, 56% felt it had helped advance their career and 55% stated it had improved their contentment with work in the veterinary industry. The CertAVP was perceived to improve evidence-based practice, clinical governance, intellectual satisfaction and encourage lifelong learning, but was not perceived to improve work–life balance. Limitation: Due to potential response bias, this study may not represent the wider population. Conclusion: Despite respondents reporting career advancement, this was only reflected in mentorship and managing more complex cases; respondents neither felt that the CertAVP resulted in promotion, a pay rise or new leadership roles, nor did it afford greater flexibility in their working schedule. © 2022 The Authors.

"Recent developments in language modeling have enabled large text encoders to derive a wealth of linguistic information from raw text corpora without supervision. Their success across natural language processing (NLP) tasks has called into question the role of man-made computational resources, such as verb lexicons, in supporting modern NLP. Still, probing analyses have concurrently exposed the limitations of the knowledge possessed by the large neural architectures, revealing them to be clever task solvers rather than self-taught linguists. Can human-designed lexical resources still help fill their knowledge gaps? Focusing on verb classification, we discuss approaches to generating verb classes multilingually and weigh the relative benefits of undertaking expensive lexicographic work and outsourcing the task to untrained native speakers. Then, we consider the evidence for the utility of augmenting pretrained language models with external verb knowledge and ponder the ways in which human expertise can continue to benefit multilingual NLP.  © 2023 by the author(s)."
"A significant percentage of COVID-19 survivors experience ongoing multisystemic symptoms that often affect daily living, a condition known as Long Covid or post-acute-sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, identifying scientific articles relevant to Long Covid is challenging since there is no standardized or consensus terminology. We developed an iterative human-in-the-loop machine learning framework combining data programming with active learning into a robust ensemble model, demonstrating higher specificity and considerably higher sensitivity than other methods. Analysis of the Long Covid Collection shows that (1) most Long Covid articles do not refer to Long Covid by any name, (2) when the condition is named, the name used most frequently in the literature is Long Covid, and (3) Long Covid is associated with disorders in a wide variety of body systems. The Long Covid Collection is updated weekly and is searchable online at the LitCovid portal: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/coronavirus/docsum?filters=e_condition.LongCovid. © 2022"
"Purpose: Studies on mining text and generating intelligence on human resource documents are rare. This research aims to use artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to facilitate the employee selection process through latent semantic analysis (LSA), bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) and support vector machines (SVM). The research also compares the performance of different machine learning, text vectorization and sampling approaches on the human resource (HR) resume data. Design/methodology/approach: LSA and BERT are used to discover and understand the hidden patterns from a textual resume dataset, and SVM is applied to build the screening model and improve performance. Findings: Based on the results of this study, LSA and BERT are proved useful in retrieving critical topics, and SVM can optimize the prediction model performance with the help of cross-validation and variable selection strategies. Research limitations/implications: The technique and its empirical conclusions provide a practical, theoretical basis and reference for HR research. Practical implications: The novel methods proposed in the study can assist HR practitioners in designing and improving their existing recruitment process. The topic detection techniques used in the study provide HR practitioners insights to identify the skill set of a particular recruiting position. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this research is the first study that uses LSA, BERT, SVM and other machine learning models in human resource management and resume classification. Compared with the existing machine learning-based resume screening system, the proposed system can provide more interpretable insights for HR professionals to understand the recommendation results through the topics extracted from the resumes. The findings of this study can also help organizations to find a better and effective approach for resume screening and evaluation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Background: The function of the thyroid gland during pregnancy undergoes physiological changes to ensure the proper amount of thyroid hormones for both the pregnant woman and the fetus. Multiple pregnancies (MP) are characterized by specific differences compared to single pregnancies, e.g., higher concentrations of human chorionic gonadotropin, which also affect thyroid function. The aim was to collect available knowledge on maternal thyroid function in MP. Methods: We have systematically searched three databases: the PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus and the Cochrane Library. The last search was run on the 4th of August 2022. We included full-text original observational and experimental studies written in English. Case reports, editorials, letters, conference abstracts, reviews and meta-analyses were excluded. No time criterion was established. Studies were considered eligible if at least one maternal thyroid function test was performed and reported. Studies on MP with a co-existing mole were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed with the use of the AXIS tool. The qualitative synthesis of evidence was applied. Results: The search strategy resulted in the identification of 821 manuscripts. After removing duplicates, we screened the titles and abstracts of 552 articles, out of which 57 were selected for full-text analysis. Finally, 12 articles were included in the review. They were conducted in 6 different countries and published between the years 1997 and 2022. The number of examined women with MP ranged from 9 to 1 626. Discussion and conclusions: Thyroid function differs between women with MP and SP. Scarce data are available on the topic, but MPs are most likely characterized by higher HCG levels, which influences thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroid hormone levels. These differences are mainly expressed in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. Separate population-based reference ranges are needed to correctly diagnose thyroid diseases in MP and to avoid unnecessary treatment. Further research is needed to fill the knowledge gaps.

"Objective: To systematically evaluate the risk factors of lower respiratory tract infection caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia for better clinical treatment. Methods: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China Journal full-text Database (CNKI), Wanfang Database (WanFang Data), VIP (VIP), and China Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) were selected and published by June 2022 about the risk factors of lower respiratory tract infection of S. maltophilia. Two researchers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and quality evaluation according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. RevMan 5.4 software was used for meta-analysis. Results: A total of 18 articles were included, including 10 in English and 8 in Chinese. Meta analysis showed that the risk factors of lower respiratory tract infection caused by S. maltophilia included disease severity, hospitalization days, use of glucocorticoids, invasive procedures, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics and use of more than 3 Antibiotics. The OR values of patients with hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, use of more than 3 Antibiotics, endotracheal intubation and tracheotomy were the highest. Specific hospitalization days (OR = 14.56, 95% CI: 6.12~23.01), mechanical ventilation (OR = 14.16, 95% CI: 5.85~34.3), use of more than 3 Antibiotics (OR = 6.21, 95% CI: 1.24~31.14), tracheal intubation (OR = 6.07, 95% CI: 1.97~3.64), tracheotomy (OR = 3.77, 95% CI: 1.09~13.04). Conclusion: There are many risk factors for lower respiratory tract infection of S. maltophilia, which can occur in patients with severe illness, high APACHE-II score, invasive procedures, and the need for broad-spectrum antibiotics. In terms of the host, these patients are characterized by impaired immune function, severe illness and long-term hospitalization, which objectively leads to the infection of S. maltophilia. Therefore, strengthening the monitoring, prevention and control of patients with risk factors of S. maltophilia infection is conducive to reducing the risk of infection and death.

"Objective: The objective of this review is to provide a modern definition and identify potential biomarkers of blood stasis in cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases by mapping, comparing, and combining Eastern and Western concepts. Introduction: Blood stasis is a pathological concept found in both Eastern and Western medical literature. In traditional East Asian medicine, blood stasis is a differential syndrome characterized by stagnant blood flow in various parts of the body. Similarly, in Western medicine, various diseases, especially cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases, are known to be accompanied by blood stasis. Numerous scientific studies on blood stasis have been conducted over the last decade, and there is a need to synthesize those results. Inclusion criteria: We will use the keywords ""blood stasis,""""blood stagnation,""""blood stagnant,""and ""blood congestion""in 3 electronic databases: PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar. In addition, we will use the keywords ""'Greek Passage'""and ""'Greek Passage'""in 4 Korean electronic databases (ie, NDSL, OASIS, KISS, and DBpia). Peer-reviewed articles published from 2010 to the present that focus on blood stasis in cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases in human subjects according to the International Classification of Diseases 11th revision categories BA00-BE2Z, 8B00-8B2Z, 8E64, and 8E65 will be included. Reviews, opinion articles, in vivo, in vitro, and in silico preclinical studies will be excluded. Methods: We will follow the frameworks by Arksey and O'Malley and Levac et al. as well as JBI guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extension for Scoping Reviews. Two reviewers will independently search and screen titles and abstracts followed by full-text screening of eligible studies. If there are discrepancies between the 2 reviewers, a third reviewer will be consulted to make the final decision. We will use descriptive narrative, tabular, and graphical displays, and content analysis to present the results.  © 2022 JBI."
"China's carbon-neutral vision imposes stricter and more urgent requirements for the transformation of the energy structure. The transformation and optimization of the energy structure is a crucial condition and measure for achieving the carbon neutrality goal. Studying the policy structure logic, such as the characteristics of policy subjects, policy tool selection preferences, and policy themes, has practical implications for the optimization of energy structure and the realization of carbon-neutrality goals. Based on the theory of policy structure, this study develops a three-dimensional analytical framework of ""policy subject-policy tool-policy focus"". It employs various methods, such as policy tool mining, to perform textual analysis on 122 energy policies within the carbon-neutral vision. Through laycr-by-laycr coding and sub-item analysis, we explore the formal characteristics of policy texts and policy tool selection preferences from the dimensions of a hierarchical system, department distribution, and time scries and comprehend the current focus of energy structure transformation policy. The study found that policy subjects involved a wide range of departments and a large number of departments, showing a certain degree of synergy, but the cross-departmental coordination and cooperation of policy subjects had not been formed; changes in the timing and number of policy releases were closely related to the top-level strategic arrangements of the country; policy direction guidance was clear and rich in content, but policy content is suspended and fragmented; there arc various types of policy tools, mainly using environmental policy tools, but the imbalance and isomorphism of the use of various types of policy tools arc exposed; the policy focus includes three aspects: controlling the intensity and total amount of energy consumption, adjusting the energy consumption of key industries structure, deepen institutional reform and encourage scientific and technological innovation. The carbon-neutral vision proposal is of great value for China to demonstrate its responsibility as a major country to build a community with a shared future for humanity and to internalize the concept of ecological civilization. The optimization of the energy structure is one of the core components of realizing the carbon-neutral vision. At this stage, the current policy strongly demonstrates China's top-down policy determination for green and low-carbon development, but we also cannot ignore the fact that China's energy revolution is under intense pressure. The transformation of energy structures is a complex social system project. Under the current transformation of energy structures beset by intense pressure and difficulties, there is room for improvement in the energy policy of my country. Based on the current policy framework and the emerging policy structure, the optimization path of energy policy in the future should focus on the following characteristics: 1) improving the coordination and linking of policy entities and establishing a cross-departmental and regional energy structure optimization mechanism; 2) emphasizing the connection and refinement of policy content. All departments and local governments should further refine and develop action and work plans based on the central policy guidelines; 3) concentrate on combining and balancing policy tools, as well as conducting research on the proportion and structure of the three types of policy tools: supply, demand, and environment. Adjust and optimize to maximize the combined effect of multiple policy tools. © 2023 Press of Tsinghua University. All rights reserved."
"Previous research has shown that language in job adverts implicitly communicates gender stereotypes, which, in turn, influence employees’ perceived fit with the job. In this way, language both reflects and maintains a gender segregated job market. The aim of this study was to test whether, and how, language in organizational descriptions reflects gender segregation in the organizations by the use of computational text analyses. We analyzed large Swedish companies’ organizational descriptions from LinkedIn (N = 409), testing whether the language in the organizational descriptions is associated with the organizations’ employee gender ratio, and how organizational descriptions for organizations with a majority of women and men employees differ. The statistical analyses showed that language in the organizational descriptions predicted the employee gender ratio in organizations well. Word clouds depicting words that differentiate between organizations with a majority of women and men employees showed that the language of organizations with a higher percentage of women employees was characterized by a local focus and emphasis on within-organizations relations, whereas the language of organizations with a higher percentage of men employees was characterized by an international focus and emphasis on sales and customer relations. These results imply that the language in organizational descriptions reflects gender segregation and stereotypes that women are associated with local and men with global workplaces. As language communicates subtle signals in regards to what potential candidate is most sought after in recruitment situations, differences in organizational descriptions can hinder underrepresented gender groups to apply to these jobs. As a consequence, such practices may contribute to gender segregation on the job market. Copyright © 2023 Stille, Sikström, Lindqvist, Renström and Gustafsson Sendén."

"Today’s probabilistic language generators fall short when it comes to producing coherent and fluent text despite the fact that the underlying models perform well under standard metrics (e.g., perplexity). This discrepancy has puzzled the language generation community for the last few years. In this work, we posit that the abstraction of natural language generation as a discrete stochastic process—which allows for an information-theoretic analysis—can provide new insights into the behavior of probabilistic language generators, for example, why high-probability texts can be dull or repetitive. Humans use language as a means of communicating information, aiming to do so in a simultaneously efficient and error-minimizing manner; in fact, psycholinguistics research suggests humans choose each word in a string with this subconscious goal in mind. We formally define the set of strings that meet this criterion: Those for which each word has an information content close to the expected information content, namely, the conditional entropy of our model. We then propose a simple and efficient procedure for enforcing this criterion when generating from probabilistic models, which we call locally typical sampling. Automatic and human evaluations show that, in comparison to nucleus and top-k sampling, locally typical sampling offers competitive performance (in both abstractive summarization and story generation) in terms of quality while consistently reducing degenerate repetitions. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

"Purpose: The hospitality sector underpins the Dominican Republic's (DR) economy but may be a setting where foodborne disease outbreaks (FBDOs) can occur. The purpose of this research is to conduct a systematic mapping exercise on the available scientific literature related to FBDOs in hospitality in the DR and their link to reported food safety and hygienic practices. Design/methodology/approach: A predefined search protocol applied the principles of PRISMA guidance. Publications (n = 2,793) from databases (e.g. Web of Science, PubMed) were identified and systematically selected for relevance. A full-text assessment based on the inclusion criteria led to the identification of a refined list of studies and academic publications (n = 22) included in this review. The descriptive analysis of the collated data is then presented graphically. Findings: A low rate of reporting highlights a knowledge gap on FBDOs, the related food safety hazards and how they are mitigated by stakeholders and local health authorities in the DR. Improving government and other stakeholder capacity to report, investigate and understand FBDOs and the practices involved is essential. Research limitations/implications: The research has implications for Government, businesses and public health officials and managers in the hospitality sector in the DR. A potential research limitation is that the search strategies could miss some relevant articles. Practical implications: The findings provide a framing for improved risk analysis in implementing food safety management strategies for FBDOs. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first systematic mapping research assessing evidence of FBDOs affecting hospitality in the DR. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Better physical fitness and stroke velocity in healthy elite compared to sub-elite tennis players have been shown in previous studies. However, evidence-based knowledge regarding the effectiveness of athletic training on physical fitness and stroke velocity is currently lacking. Thus, the objective of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to characterize, aggregate, and quantify athletic training effects on measures of physical fitness and stroke velocity in healthy youth and adult tennis players. A computerized systematic literature search was performed in the databases PubMed, Web of Science, and SportDiscus from their inception date to August 2022. Studies were included, among others, if the intervention period lasted a minimum of four weeks and if at least one parameter of physical fitness (i.e., speed, agility, lower-extremity muscle power, upper-extremity muscle power/strength, endurance, balance, flexibility) or stroke performance (i.e., stroke velocity) was tested. Initially, 11,511 articles were identified, after removing duplicates and assessing abstracts and full texts, 24 articles were used to calculate weighted standardized mean differences (SMD). For measures of physical fitness, athletic training resulted in small (speed: SMD = 0.44), moderate (endurance: SMD = 0.61, upper-extremity muscle power: SMD = 0.72; flexibility: SMD = 0.63), and large (agility: SMD = 0.93, lower-extremity muscle power: SMD = 0.88; upper-extremity muscle strength: SMD = 0.90; balance: SMD = 0.88) effects. Further, a large effect (SMD = 0.90) on stroke velocity was detected. The additionally performed sub-analyses showed differences in the effectiveness of athletic training on variables of physical fitness and stroke speed when considering players' age (i.e., youth players: <18 years; adult players: ≥18 years). Precisely, there was a high potential for training-related adaptations in adult players with respect to lower-extremity muscle power, upper-extremity muscle strength, and stroke velocity and in youth players with respect to endurance. Interventions to promote physical fitness and stroke velocity in healthy tennis players revealed varying levels of effectiveness ranging from small to large and these were additionally affected by players' age. Therefore, future studies should investigate modalities to increase training efficacy in youth and adult tennis players, especially for fitness components that showed small- to moderate-sized changes. 2023 Lambrich and Muehlbauer."
"Offensive communications have made their way into social media posts. Using computational algorithms to distinguish objectionable content is one of the most effective ways to deal with this problem. One of the most effective approaches to deal with this issue is to use computational methods to distinguish undesirable content. This research aims to tackle MOLD_DL (Multilingual Offensive Language Detection using deep learning) techniques and natural language processing used in feature selection and classification. Here the dataset has been collected from YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, which has been pre-processed for noise removal, filtering and removing the stop words and segmented. The feature selection has been carried out for segmented data using Fuzzy based convolutional neural network (FCNN). Then the extraction of selected features and classification has been carried out using ensemble architecture of Bi-LSTM model with Naïve Bayes architecture hybrid with Support Vector Machines (SVM). Evaluation of offensive language detection is classified automatically based on the emotions of the text. Here the experimental analysis has been carried out for YouTube, Twitter and Facebook datasets in terms of accuracy of 98%, precision of 95%, recall of 90%, F-1 score of 92.5% and RMSE of 45% with the confusion matrix in detecting offensive text of various languages. © 2022"
"We present PrinType, a fingerprint recognition based typing technique for virtual reality. Different regions of fingers covered by friction ridges are assigned to different keys (i.e. letters, numbers, punctuation, or functions). Once the thumb-worn fingerprint sensor touches a finger, the contact region (and its key) is recognized by matching the current image with registered templates. Using only a small sensor, PrinType turns each segment of all fingers into a touchable key. We designed keyboard layouts corresponding to three interaction sub-spaces: whole finger keyboard, fingertip keyboard, and single-handed keyboard. A 12-person user study was conducted to evaluate the performance of different strategies. Our user evaluation showed that participants achieved an average of 29.56, 32.38, and 34.22 WPM with 0.79%, 0.20%, and 0.21% not corrected error rate in the three strategies. In addition, we provided a detailed analysis of various micro metrics to further understand user performance and technical characteristics. Overall, PrinType is favored by users for its usability, efficiency, and novelty.  © 2023 ACM."
"The Royal Society of Chemistry hereby wholly retracts this RSC Advances article due to concerns with the reliability of the data. The ?rst three bands in the ‘ZO-1’ western blot panel in Fig. 4B are duplicated as the last three bands in the ‘MyD88’ panel in Fig. 5B. The b-actin control panel in Fig. 4B is duplicated in Fig. 5B. In addition, in the ‘Materials and methods’ section, the authors state that GAPDH was used as the reference gene, which does not match with the information presented in Fig. 4B and 5B where bactin is used as the control. Furthermore, the western blot panels, ‘ZO-1’ (Fig. 4B) and ‘MyD88’ (Fig. 5B) were previously published in another paper with no authors in common.1 There is also considerable text overlap in the ‘Results’ and ‘Materials and methods’ sections with ref. 1.

"Objective: To examine the effect of diet quality on the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus. Methods: This review included cohort and case-control studies reporting an association between diet quality and gestational diabetes mellitus. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, Chinese Periodical Full-text Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and China Wanfang Database for studies published from inception to November 18, 2022. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used for quality assessment, and the overall quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADEpro GDT. Results: A total of 19 studies (15 cohort, four case-control) with 108,084 participants were included. We found that better higher diet quality before or during pregnancy reduced the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus, including a higher Mediterranean diet (OR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.30–0.86), dietary approaches to stop hypertension (OR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.44–0.97), Alternate Healthy Eating Index (OR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.44–0.83), overall plant-based diet index (OR: 0.57; 95% CI: 0.41–0.78), and adherence to national dietary guidelines (OR: 0.39; 95% CI:0.31–0.48). However, poorer diet quality increased the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus, including a higher dietary inflammatory index (OR: 1.37; 95% CI: 1.21–1.57) and overall low-carbohydrate diets (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.22–1.64). After meta-regression, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses, the results remained statistically significant. Conclusions: Before and during pregnancy, higher diet quality reduced the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus, whereas poorer diet quality increased this risk.

"Background: Low vision affects over 300 million people worldwide and can compromise both activities of daily living and quality of life. Rehabilitative training and vision assistive equipment (VAE) may help, but some visually impaired people have limited resources to attend in-person visits to rehabilitation clinics to be trained to learn to use VAE. These people may be able to overcome barriers to care through access to remote, internet-based consultation (telerehabilitation). Objectives: To compare the effects of telerehabilitation with face-to-face (e.g. in-office or inpatient) vision rehabilitation services for improving vision-related quality of life and near reading ability in people with visual function loss due to any ocular condition. Secondary objectives were to evaluate compliance with scheduled rehabilitation sessions, abandonment rates for VAE devices, and patient satisfaction ratings. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2021, Issue 9); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; ClinicalTrials.gov; and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any language restriction or study design filter in the electronic searches; however, we restricted the searches from 1980 onwards because the internet was not introduced to the public until 1982. We last searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE Ovid, Embase, and PubMed on 14 September 2021, and the trial registries on 16 March 2022. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) in which participants diagnosed with low vision had received vision rehabilitation services remotely from a human provider using internet, web-based technology compared with an approach involving in-person consultations. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts retrieved by the searches of the electronic databases and then full-text articles for eligible studies. Two review authors independently abstracted data from the included studies. Any discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Main results: We identified one RCT/CCT that indirectly met our inclusion criteria, and two ongoing trials that met our inclusion criteria. The included trial had an overall high risk of bias. We did not conduct a quantitative analysis since multiple controlled trials were not identified. The single included trial of 57 participants utilized a parallel-group design. It compared 30 hours of either personalized low vision training through telerehabilitation with a low vision therapist (the experimental group) with the self-training standard provided by eSight using the eSkills User Guide that was self-administered by the participants at home for one hour per day for 30 days (the comparison group). The trial investigators found a similar direction of effects for both groups for vision-related quality of life and satisfaction at two weeks, three months, and six months. A greater proportion of participants in the comparison group had abandoned or discontinued use of the eSight Eyewear at two weeks than those in the telerehabilitation group, but discontinuance rates were similar between groups at one month and three months. We rated the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes as very low due to high risk of bias in randomization processes and missing outcome data and imprecision. Authors' conclusions: The included trial found similar efficacy between telerehabilitation with a therapist and an active control intervention of self-guided training in mostly younger to middle-aged adults with low vision who received a new wearable electronic aid. Given the disease burden and the growing interest in telemedicine, the two ongoing studies, when completed, may provide further evidence of the potential for telerehabilitation as a platform for providing services to people with low vision.

"Dictation is considered an efficient exercise for testing the language proficiency of learners of French as a Foreign Language (FFL). However, the traditional teaching approach to dictation reduces the instructional feedback efficiency. To remedy this, this study adopts a design-based research approach and builds an automatic error type annotation platform for dictation practice named FRETA-D (French error type annotation for dictation) to pursue intelligent pedagogical feedback for both FFL teachers and students. FRETA-D can automatically identify error boundaries as well as classify the errors into fine-grained error types in learners’ dictation texts. FRETA-D features a dataset-independent classifier based on a framework with 25 main error types, which is generalized from French grammar rules and characteristics of frequent learner dictation errors. Five French teachers are invited to evaluate the appropriateness of automatically predicted error types of 147 randomly selected samples, and the acceptance rate reaches more than 85%. Automatic evaluation on 1,009 sentences by comparing with manually labeled references also shows promising results, reaching more than 85% consistency with human judgments. The accessibility of FRETA-D has also been confirmed by 50 Chinese undergraduate FFL learners with different professional backgrounds. FRETA-D facilitates conducting dynamic statistical analysis of learners’error types. And we share the same findings with previous studies that there exist causal links between the dictation errors and learners’ mastery of French phoneme and grapheme.

"The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in management research is still nascent and has primarily focused on content analyses of text data. Some method scholars have begun to discuss the potential benefits of far broader applications; however, these discussions have not led yet to a wave of corresponding AI applications by management researchers. This chapter explores the feasibility and the potential value of using AI for a very specific methodological task: the reliable and efficient capturing of higher-level psychological constructs in management research. It introduces the capturing of basic emotions and emotional authenticity of entrepreneurs based on their macro-and microfacial expressions during pitch presentations as an illustrative example of related AI opportunities and challenges. Thus, this chapter provides both motivation and guidance to management scholars for future applications of AI to advance management research. © 2023 by Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Deferred prosecution agreements (DPAs) are a legal tool for the nontrial resolution of cases of corruption. Each DPA is accompanied by a Statement of Facts that provides detailed and publicly available textual records of the given cases, including summarized evidence of who was involved, what they committed, and with whom. These statements can be translated into networks amenable to social network analysis allowing an analysis of the structure and dynamics of each case. In this study, we show how to extract information about which actors were involved in a given case, the relations and interactions among these actors (e.g., communication or payments), and their relevant individual attributes (gender, affiliation, and sector) from five Statements of Fact. We code the extracted information manually with two independent coders and subsequently, we assess the inter-coder reliability. For assessing the coding reliability of nodes and attributes, we use a matching coefficient, whereas for assessing the coding reliability of ties, we construct a network from the coding of each coder and subsequently calculate the graph correlations of the two resulting networks. The coding of nodes and ties in the five extracted networks turns out to be highly reliable with only slightly lower coding reliability in the case of the largest network. The coding of attributes is highly reliable as well, although it is prone to missing data on actors' gender. We conclude by discussing the flexibility of our data collection framework and its extension by including network dynamics and nonhuman actors (such as companies) in the network representation.  © The Author(s), 2023.

"Importance: Statins reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, but less than one-half of individuals in America who meet guideline criteria for a statin are actively prescribed this medication. Objective: To evaluate whether nudges to clinicians, patients, or both increase initiation of statin prescribing during primary care visits. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cluster randomized clinical trial evaluated statin prescribing of 158 clinicians from 28 primary care practices including 4131 patients. The design included a 12-month preintervention period and a 6-month intervention period between October 19, 2019, and April 18, 2021. Interventions: The usual care group received no interventions. The clinician nudge combined an active choice prompt in the electronic health record during the patient visit and monthly feedback on prescribing patterns compared with peers. The patient nudge was an interactive text message delivered 4 days before the visit. The combined nudge included the clinician and patient nudges. Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was initiation of a statin prescription during the visit. Results: The sample comprised 4131 patients with a mean (SD) age of 65.5 (10.5) years; 2120 (51.3%) were male; 1210 (29.3%) were Black, 106 (2.6%) were Hispanic, 2732 (66.1%) were White, and 83 (2.0%) were of other race or ethnicity, and 933 (22.6%) had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In unadjusted analyses during the preintervention period, statins were prescribed to 5.6% of patients (105 of 1876) in the usual care group, 4.8% (97 of 2022) in the patient nudge group, 6.0% (104 of 1723) in the clinician nudge group, and 4.7% (82 of 1752) in the combined group. During the intervention, statins were prescribed to 7.3% of patients (75 of 1032) in the usual care group, 8.5% (100 of 1181) in the patient nudge group, 13.0% (128 of 981) in the clinician nudge arm, and 15.5% (145 of 937) in the combined group. In the main adjusted analyses relative to usual care, the clinician nudge significantly increased statin prescribing alone (5.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.4 to 7.8 percentage points; P =.01) and when combined with the patient nudge (7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 5.1 to 9.1 percentage points; P =.001). The patient nudge alone did not change statin prescribing relative to usual care (0.9 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.8 to 2.5 percentage points; P =.32). Conclusions and Relevance: Nudges to clinicians with and without a patient nudge significantly increased initiation of a statin prescription during primary care visits.

Although other simulators have been proposed, there is still a need for an accessible, educationally useful, low-cost peritonsillar abscess simulator to build skills and confidence in the novice. Methods The peritonsillar abscess simulator was constructed from basic disposable healthcare equipment and a party balloon. Evaluation of this Newport Quinsy Simulator was performed by expert and novice clinicians, who provided feedback in the form of Likert scales and free-text qualitative responses. Results Overall, 24 clinicians evaluated the simulator. All felt the simulator was useful for the novice otolaryngologist, and represented the key anatomy and motor skills needed to drain a peritonsillar abscess. Qualitative evaluation highlighted the educational usefulness of the simulator as a peritonsillar abscess training device. Conclusion The Newport Quinsy Simulator is affordable, accessible, easy to use and educationally valuable to the novice otolaryngologist.  Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

"Introduction: The purpose of this study was to assess the landscape of thyroid nodules research during the last 22 years using machine learning and text analysis. Methods: In November 2021, we obtained from PubMed all works indexed under the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) subject line “thyroid nodules.” The entire set of search results was retrieved in XML format, and metadata such as title, abstract, keywords, MeSH words, and year of publication were extracted for bibliometric evaluation from the original XML files. To increase the specificity of the investigation, the Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling method was applied. Results: Our study included 5,770 research papers. By using frequency analysis of MeSH terms, research on thyroid nodules was divided into two categories: clinical and basic. The proportion of clinical research is nearing 89% and is dominated by the differential diagnosis of thyroid nodules. In contrast, the proportion of MeSH terms relating to basic research was just 11%, with DNA mutation analysis being the most common topic. Following this, LDA analysis revealed the thyroid nodule study had three clusters: Imaging Studies, Biopsy and Diagnosis, and Epidemiology and Screening of Thyroid Cancer. The result suggests that current thyroid nodule research appears to have focused on ultrasonography and histological diagnosis, which are tightly correlated. Molecular biomarker research has increased, therefore enhancing the diagnostic precision of thyroid nodules. However, inflammation, anxiety, and mental health disorders related to thyroid nodules have received little attention. Conclusion: Basic research on thyroid nodules has unmet research requirements. Future research could focus on developing strategies to more efficiently identify malignant nodules, exploring the mechanism of thyroid nodule development, and enhancing the quality of life of thyroid patients.

"Importance: Turbinate surgery is an effective treatment for allergic rhinitis (AR) refractory to medical treatment. However, the long-term outcomes of turbinate surgery are still unclear and have not yet been confirmed by a meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature. Objective: To investigate the long-term outcomes and safety of turbinate surgery in AR by performing a meta-analysis. Data Sources: MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through April 2021. Study Selection: Studies that analyzed turbinate surgery alone, had a follow-up period of more than 1 year, examined long-term efficacy of turbinate surgery, used current turbinate surgery methods, and were published in a peer-reviewed journal were included. Full-text reviews were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Conflicts were resolved by a third reviewer. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Descriptive and quantitative data were extracted; weighted mean difference (WMD) was synthesized under a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic and the I2metric. This study was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guidelines. Main Outcomes and Measures: The long-term outcomes of turbinate surgery on subjective nasal symptoms and objective parameters. Results: Of the 3962 citations retrieved, 18 studies comprising 1411 patients were included. Findings showed significantly decreased symptom scores in nasal obstruction (WMD, 4.60, 95% CI, 3.43-5.76), rhinorrhea (WMD, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.97-4.28), sneezing (WMD, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.74-3.54), itching (WMD, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.20-2.30), and nasal resistance (WMD, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.08-0.24) and a significant increased total nasal volume (WMD, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.73-1.19). There was no significant difference in the occurrence of any complication. More than 1 year after surgery, the improvements in nasal obstruction (WMD, 5.18; 95% CI, 3.00-7.37), rhinorrhea (WMD, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.78-5.37), and sneezing (WMD, 2.95; 95% CI, 1.58-4.32) were maintained. Conclusions and Relevance: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, turbinate surgery was associated with positive outcomes in AR and maintained the association during long-term follow-up. The rate of complications is also low. These findings can guide the preoperative counseling of patients with AR being considered for turbinate surgery.. © 2023 American Medical Association.

"Papers and patents can respectively present the latest progress of scientific research and technological development. Combining the two for correlation analysis has certain reference significance for technology opportunity discovery. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for technology opportunity discovery of proton exchange membrane fuel cell from the perspective of papers-patents correlation analysis. Firstly, papers and patent data are collected from papers and patent databases and the LDA model is applied to extract paper and patent topics. Secondly, the indicators of topic heat and novelty are calculated to select high-value paper topics. After that, the similarity analysis between high-value paper topics and all patent topics is considered to select the patent topics with development potential. Finally, the patent texts with high relevance to these patent topics with development potential are positioned. The technical keywords in them are extracted by text mining tool and classified into innovation dimensions according to their attributes and the TEMPEST model. After that, the innovation rules in the SCAMPER model are introduced to combine with the technical keywords in each innovation dimension to identify specific technology opportunities. An empirical study on the technology of proton exchange membrane fuel cell provides sufficient evidence of the method’s ability to discover technology opportunities. This paper contributes by generating four specific technology opportunities, which can make up for the existing defects of proton exchange membrane fuel cells and provide useful guidance for companies to carry out technological innovation.

"Proper names have always played a significant role in the history of language and culture of any nation. Besides, research on personal names in different epochs and in local regions are important both for history and onomastics. Surnames could reflect the history of a nation almost in every country because they are passed on from one generation to the next. Surnames are particularly interesting for studying traditions and they are strictly connected to the social and historical background in the analyzed region. The study of surnames can also be of benefit to other areas of onomastics such as toponomastics and socio-onomastics. Although the topic of surnames has been exploited in many countries and languages for a long period, there are still some new aspects that can be presented on this topic. This research examines the surnames in the mass media in the Odesa Region. Historically, the Odesa region was multicultural that is why we came across with both Slavic and non-Slavic surnames but the object of this investigation is Slavic surnames. The analyzed mass-media texts are drawn from the 19th-century newspapers Odessa Vestnik and Odessa Advertisement Sheet. About 2,000 surnames were taken for the analysis from announcements and advertisements in these newspapers. The study of the surnames has concentrated on the names of all levels of the society. The purpose of the paper is to make the typology of the surnames and present the quantity of surnames in each group. Some historical events that impact the name-giving process are mentioned and social factors which influence the name-giving process are described. The study has revealed that 19th-century surnames were created from anthroponyms, toponyms, ethnonyms, and appellatives. The last group contains occupational surnames, surnames with the semantics of fauna and flora as well as surnames derived from other concrete or abstract nouns. An additional complicating factor was that it was not always easy to interpret and identify the origin of some surnames. The results of this paper indicated that analyzed surnames from the 19th century in this region are part of culture. The surnames derived from appellatives represent a significant part of the studied surnames (56%), among them there are occupational surnames (13%); surnames with the semantics of flora and fauna (23%) as well as surnames having other concrete or abstract meanings (20%). Personal names make up 29%, toponyms are of 11%, and the least frequent category is surnames derived from ethnonyms (4%). From the perspective of further research, it would be interesting to compare the received results with the typology of the modern surnames in the same region. © 2022 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest."
"Introduction: There has been significant development in blood-based biomarkers targeting amyloidopathy of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the guidelines for integrating such biomarkers into AD diagnosis are still inadequate. Multimer Detection System-Oligomeric Amyloid-β (MDS-OAβ) as a plasma biomarker detecting oligomerization tendency is available in the clinical practice. Main text: We suggest how to interpret the results of plasma biomarker for amyloidopathy using MDS-OAβ with neuropsychological test, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and amyloid PET for AD diagnosis. Combination of each test result differentiates various stages of AD, other neurodegenerative diseases, or cognitive impairment due to the causes other than neurodegeneration. Discussion: A systematic interpretation strategy could support accurate diagnosis and staging of AD. Moreover, comprehensive use of biomarkers that target amyloidopathy such as amyloid PET on brain amyloid plaque and MDS-OAβ on amyloid-β oligomerization tendency can complement to gain advanced insights on amyloid-β dynamics in AD.

"Automata based algorithms have always dominated the history of string matching, thanks to their intrinsic nature of recognizers. Among them, those based on the suffix automaton deserve a special mention, because its use has always led to elegant and very efficient solutions in practice. In this paper, we present two novel string matching algorithms based on the suffix automaton which are particularly suitable for very long strings. The first algorithm simulates the suffix automaton through the well known bit-parallelism approach, while the second makes use of an alternative non-standard simulation. We mainly focus on the second solution, which turns out to be more flexible in practice, and present some extensions of it. Experimental results suggest that both our solutions are very efficient in practical cases scaling much better when the length of the pattern increases. Moreover, our second approach is also competitive with the most effective solutions available for the exact string matching problem. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"We present DRG-Keyboard, a gesture keyboard enabled by dual IMU rings, allowing the user to swipe the thumb on the index fingertip to perform word gesture typing as if typing on a miniature QWERTY keyboard. With dual IMUs attached to the user's thumb and index finger, DRG-Keyboard can 1) measure the relative attitude while mapping it to the 2D fingertip coordinates and 2) detect the thumb's touch-down and touch-up events combining the relative attitude data and the synchronous frequency domain data, based on which a fingertip gesture keyboard can be implemented. To understand users typing behavior on the index fingertip with DRG-Keyboard, we collected and analyzed user data in two typing manners. Based on the statistics of the gesture data, we enhanced the elastic matching algorithm with rigid pruning and distance measurement transform. The user study showed DRG-Keyboard achieved an input speed of 12.9 WPM (68.3% of their gesture typing speed on the smartphone) for all participants. The appending study also demonstrated the superiority of DRG-Keyboard for better form factors and wider usage scenarios. To sum up, DRG-Keyboard not only achieves good text entry speed merely on a tiny fingertip input surface, but is also well accepted by the participants for the input subtleness, accuracy, good haptic feedback, and availability.  © 2023 ACM."
"A commentary is proposed that sheds light on the dark places in one of the most debatable poems by O. Mandelstam. The results of the study suggest that the conceptual basis of the text is the metaphor of reading a book of nature. Judging by the context, this book presented here as a textbook is written in the language of mathematics, which reflects the poet's attitude to mathematics as a basic science, which, in his opinion, expressed in the paper The Nineteenth Century (1922), one of all other ways of knowing the world can lead to objective solutions. The text is significantly obscured as a result of the use of a complex set of stylistic tactics. This complex, which actually turned the octave No. 11 into a semiotic enigma, in particular, consists of: 1. A number of metaphors, three of which are extended: a) a mathematical metaphor; b) a metaphor of reading; c) a floral metaphor, likening human knowledge to a neglected garden. 2. Three zeugmas that combined the links of these expanded metaphors into a multidimensional associative whole. Characteristic of Acmeism is the tactic of ""superimposing an image on an image""(A. Tolstoy) extremely complicated the semantic structure of the octave, which from this point of view is a semantic palimpsest formed by a number of figurative layers. 3. Two transfers abstractum pro concreto. In research devoted to the octave No. 11, literal interpretations of a number of figurative expressions are accepted, which does not contribute to an adequate understanding of this complex work. The text is written in an elevated style, which corresponds to: 1) the verse length: a nine-syllable verse alternates with an eight-syllable one, which is characteristic of the ode genre (the same syllabic alternance is found in the odes of M. Lomonosov, G. Derzhavin, I. Krylov, V. Kapnist, P. Antokolsky, etc.); 2) a long (three-syllable) meter; 3) the spaciousness of syntactic constructions; 4) the absence of sharp verse transfers and verse divisions; 5) the polysyndeton on ""and""characteristic of the Bible. It should be assumed that in lyrical poetry, in particular in Mandelstam's texts, a high stylistic register correlates with an elocutive obscurity. The interpretation of dark places requires the use of consituative as well as contextual analysis, the modern version of which obligatorily assumes an appeal to: 1) the typology of elocutionary tactics, in particular semantic transfers; 2) the techniques of experimental methodology, primarily transformational analysis. The results of the consituative testing must be verified by the data of the linguistic analysis et vice versa; otherwise, as well as in the case of the researcher's distance from these methods, the connections between the artistic world and the reality reflected in it are distorted; it is in these two cases that we observe methodological omissions in the field of the study of Mandelstam's poetics, the level of the image of comparison, the structural-semantic model, or both at the same time. © 2022 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest."
"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine what qualities contributed to the durability of The Evolution of Management Thought (EMT) as a classic that provided scholars a grand narrative of management history for half a century. Specifically, this paper aspires to reveal how the EMT has overcome the boundedness of time over the past 50 years by being both timeless (signaling continuity/permanence) and historical (signaling change/contingency). Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze both the metaphorical (i.e. universal) and the historical (i.e. particular) meanings that the EMT authors have communicated over eight editions of the classic. Findings: The authors found that Wren and Bedeian have managed to balance temporality and referentiality in the EMT by writing it as the “practical past” of management. The authors also found that the authors ensured the ongoing renewal of their classic by innovating it as an everlasting contemporary text. Originality/value: This paper provides an original analysis of the EMT explaining why it is a “classic” of management history. The analysis presented in this paper reveals why this timeless work has been a singular touchstone that exemplifies the history of management discipline. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"In creativity research, ideational flexibility, the ability to generate ideas by shifting between concepts, has long been the focus of investigation. However, psychometric work to develop measurement procedures for flexibility has generally lagged behind other creativity-relevant constructs such as fluency and originality. Here, we build from extant research to theoretically posit, and then empirically validate, a text-mining based method for measuring flexibility in verbal divergent thinking (DT) responses. The empirical validation of this method is accomplished in two studies. In the first study, we use the verbal form of the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) to demonstrate that our novel flexibility scoring method strongly and positively correlates with traditionally used TTCT flexibility scores. In the second study, we conduct a confirmatory factor analysis using the Alternate Uses Task to show reliability and construct validity of our text-mining based flexibility scoring. In addition, we also examine the relationship between personality facets and flexibility of ideas to provide criterion validity of our scoring methodology. Given the psychometric evidence presented here and the practicality of automated scores, we recommend adopting this new method which provides a less labor-intensive and less costly objective measurement of flexibility.

"In the context of national archaeological park construction, tourists' cultural perception has an important impact on the formation of local identity. It is an important factor in the protection and development of the National Archaeological Site Park. The purpose of this paper is to understand the attitudes of visitors to the National Archaeological Site Park, and to analyze their cultural perception of archaeological site park. This paper uses network text mining method to explore cultural perception. The author took public comments on Ctrip as sample data, then, obtained high-frequency words through ROST Content Mining software, conducted network semantic and sentiment analysis. Through the discussion of the cultural perception and experience of tourists in National Archaeological Site Park, the author concluded that: 1. Tourists' cultural perception of National Archaeological Site Park includes overall experience perception, cultural content perception and cultural form perception; 2. The cultural content of the National Archaeological Site Park shows a three-level structure of 'core, transition, edge'; 3. Tourists show certain preferences in the content, form and means of experience in the archaeological site park. On this basis, the author proposed suggestions to improve visitor experience of archaeological site parks based on cultural perception.  © 2023 The authors and IOS Press."

"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of board secretaries’ characteristics on annual report readability using an original method that evaluates the readability of Chinese characters. Design/methodology/approach: The authors manually collect board secretaries’ characteristics from the China Securities Market and Accounting Research database and obtain annual reports from the China Information website. Ordinary least square regression is applied to evaluate the impact, and then robustness tests and additional regression analyses are conducted. Findings: Board secretaries’ legal-professional expertise, international expertise and role duality improve annual report readability. However, their political connections are negatively associated with it. The effect of expertise (role duality) is more pronounced for firms with lower ex ante litigation risk (board secretaries with equity holdings). Furthermore, higher readability increases the compensation of board secretaries, whereas lower readability increases their turnover. Finally, annual report readability is positively related to firm performance. Research limitations/implications: The authors only investigate listed firms in China from 2007 to 2017 because of the difficulties of obtaining data and text mining. Practical implications: The authors provide managerial insights for regulators aiming to establish an effective governance mechanism with Chinese characteristics. First, certain requirements for board secretaries’ expertise can improve annual report readability. Further, firms can consider appointing board members or senior executives as board secretaries to enhance disclosure quality. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first to verify the effect of board secretaries’ characteristics on disclosure quality, especially annual report readability. Moreover, this study proposes a novel measure of annual report readability for Chinese texts. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"OBJECTIVE: We analyze observed reductions in physician note length and documentation time, 2 contributors to electronic health record (EHR) burden and burnout. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used EHR metadata from January to May, 2021 for 130 079 ambulatory physician Epic users. We identified cohorts of physicians who decreased note length and/or documentation time and analyzed changes in their note composition. RESULTS: 37 857 physicians decreased either note length (n = 15 647), time in notes (n = 15 417), or both (n = 6793). Note length decreases were primarily attributable to reductions in copy/paste text (average relative change of -18.9%) and templated text (-17.2%). Note time decreases were primarily attributable to reductions in manual text (-27.3%) and increases in note content from other care team members (+21.1%). DISCUSSION: Organizations must consider priorities and tradeoffs in the distinct approaches needed to address different contributors to EHR burden. CONCLUSION: Future research should explore scalable burden-reduction initiatives responsive to both note bloat and documentation time. © The Author(s) 2022.

"Information mining and semantic analysis have gained significant attention over recent years to obtain appropriate information from unstructured data. Several approaches have been introduced for web information mining. However, the expected accuracy is not reached by these approaches. Therefore, hybrid fuzzy clustering and enhanced latent Dirichlet allocation (ELDA) are proposed for the accuracy increment in this work. The information clustering process is performed using the hybrid fuzzy clustering algorithm called fuzzy-C-medoids optimized using improved whale algorithm. The clustering procedure entails grouping data points into more similar clusters than data points from other clusters. Finally, the context of the text is recognized by analyzing the semantic information with ELDA, which offers a suitable index for accurate and fast data extraction. PYTHON tool is used to develop the proposed web mining model, and the simulation analysis of the proposed model is carried out using the BibTex dataset and compared with baseline models. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using purity, normalized mutual information, accuracy, and precision metrics. Also, it is compared with different existing algorithms. Thus, the analysis of the results proved that the proposed approach achieves better outcomes than the existing approaches. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Background: Emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria makes exploration of natural antibacterial products imperative. Like other fruit processing industry by-products, date kernels, a waste from date processing industry is rich in its extractable polyphenols. The rich polyphenolic content suggests that date kernel extracts (DKE) can be a cost-effective source of antimicrobial agents, however, their antibacterial activity is poorly understood. Hence, a systematic review of available literature to establish DKE’s antibacterial activity is warranted. Methods: A systematic PRISMA approach was employed, and relevant studies were identified using defined keywords from Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases. The search results were screened based on predefined eligibility criteria and data extraction, organization, pooling, and descriptive statistical analyses of original research records conducted. Results: A total of 888 published records were retrieved from databases. Preliminary screening by applying specific eligibility criteria reduced records to 96 which after full text screening further decreased to 14 records. Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were the most studied organisms. Results indicate moderate to highly active effect shown by the less polar solvent based DKE’s against Gram-positive and by the aqueous based DKE’s against Gram-negative bacteria. The review confirms antibacterial activity of DKE against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Heterogeneity in reported polyphenolic content and antibacterial activity are due to differences in cultivars, extraction methods, test methods, model organisms, etc. Use of standardized protocols for isolation, characterization, testing of DKE’s active polyphenols to elucidate its antibacterial activity is recommended to establish the clinical efficacy of natural antibacterial compounds from DKE. Conclusion: This review outlines the current knowledge regarding antibacterial activity of polyphenolic DKE, identifying gaps in information and provides key recommendations for future research directions.

"Purpose: Although insurance companies contribute to about $600 billion of the US gross domestic product and employ 2.7 million people, the overall perception of clients and workers employed in this domain is poor. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to propose recommendations to improve the service quality of insurance companies using the voice of customers and employees that are available online. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed methodology consists of four stages: extracting text reviews posted by employees and customers, reviewing feedback using bigrams and trigrams, determining topics and identifying quality-associated managerial recommendations using the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) and root cause analysis techniques. Findings: Our results indicate that primary causes for client dissatisfaction are improper client assistance services, inefficient claims processing, issues related to payments/fees and unresponsive ancillary services. Offering different types of payment methods, immediate car replacement policy and features such as smartphone applications are commended very well. The major reasons for workforce frustrations include long and overly complex training, lack of social events and incentive programs. Coworkers, workplace facilities, clean work environment and other amenities are shown to have a positive impact on employees' satisfaction level. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to propose recommendations to improve the service quality of insurance companies using the voice of customers and employees that are available online. The proposed quality-related insights can assist insurance companies in improving the outlook of their workers as well as customers. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

"A growing body of research outlines how to best facilitate and ensure methodological rigor when using dictionary-based computerized text analyses (DBCTA) in organizational research. However, these best practices are currently scattered across several methodological and empirical manuscripts, making it difficult for scholars new to the technique to implement DBCTA in their own research. To better equip researchers looking to leverage this technique, this methodological report consolidates current best practices for applying DBCTA into a single, practical guide. In doing so, we provide direction regarding how to make key design decisions and identify valuable resources to help researchers from the beginning of the research process through final publication. Consequently, we advance DBCTA methods research by providing a one-stop reference for novices and experts alike concerning current best practices and available resources. © 2023 by Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Social media platforms present significant threats against underage users targeted for predatory intents. Many early research works have applied the footprints left by online predators to investigate online grooming. While digital forensics tools provide security to online users, it also encounters some critical challenges, such as privacy issues and the lack of data for research in this field. Our literature review investigates all research papers on grooming detection in online conversations by looking at the psychological definitions and aspects of grooming. We study the psychological theories behind the grooming characteristics used by machine learning models that have led to predatory stage detection. Our survey broadly considers the authorship profiling research works used for grooming detection in online conversations, along with predatory conversation detection and predatory identification approaches. Various approaches for online grooming detection have been evaluated based on the metrics used in the grooming detection problem. We have also categorized the available datasets and used feature vectors to give readers a deep knowledge of the problem considering their constraints and open research gaps. Finally, this survey details the constraints that challenge grooming detection, unaddressed problems, and possible future solutions to improve the state-of-the-art and make the algorithms more reliable. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"Purpose: Online knowledge communities have emerged as crucial places for knowledge and risk management in the face of systemic risks. The vitality of online knowledge communities requires users’ active engagement. This research paper aims to explore how text complex level and text analytic level as effective risk knowledge design leverages encourage users’ engagement under different “riskification” levels. Design/methodology/approach: This paper performs linguistic analysis on 210 TED talk transcripts and 38,377 comments from 2002 to 2018. The authors construct the variable of text complex level and conduct ordinary least squares regressions to test the relationships among text complex level, text analytic level and user engagement under different levels of “riskification” in the online knowledge community. Findings: High text complex level decreases engagement, while high text analytic level increases engagement. A high level of “riskification” exaggerates the negative effect of text complex level but diminishes the positive effect of the text analytic level. Originality/value: This research advances knowledge management by highlighting users’ engagement and responding to shared risk knowledge from a different perspective than knowledge supply. The focus on risk communication in online knowledge communities broadens the scope of knowledge management literature beyond the confines of organizations.

"The prediction of missing links of open knowledge graphs (OpenKGs) poses unique challenges compared with well-studied curated knowledge graphs (CuratedKGs). Unlike CuratedKGs whose entities are fully disambiguated against a fixed vocabulary, OpenKGs consist of entities represented by non-canonicalized free-form noun phrases and do not require an ontology specification, which drives the synonymity (multiple entities with different surface forms have the same meaning) and sparsity (a large portion of entities with few links). How to capture synonymous features in such sparse situations and how to evaluate the multiple answers pose challenges to existing models and evaluation protocols. In this paper, we propose VGAT, a variational autoencoder densified graph attention model to automatically mine synonymity features, and propose CR, a cluster ranking protocol to evaluate multiple answers in OpenKGs. For the model, VGAT investigates the following key ideas: (1) phrasal synonymity encoder attempts to capture phrasal features, which can automatically make entities with synonymous texts have closer representations; (2) neighbor synonymity encoder mines structural features with a graph attention network, which can recursively make entities with synonymous neighbors closer in representations. (3) densification attempts to densify the OpenKGs by generating similar embeddings and negative samples. For the protocol, CR is designed from the significance and compactness perspectives to comprehensively evaluate multiple answers. Extensive experiments and analysis show the effectiveness of the VGAT model and rationality of the CR protocol. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Correction contents: In the contents of the thesis, the Ti 2p XPS data is corrected as follows, and the binding energy of Ti3+ 2p1/2 peak is corrected to 463.2 eV. Additionally, Fig. 6 also wants to change to the figure below. [Formula presented] Fig. 6. (a) XPS depth profile of the TiO2thinfilm, (b) Deconvolution of Ti 2p peaks. The authors regret “insert corrigendum text”. [Formula presented] Fig. 6. (a) XPS depth profile of the TiO2 thin film, (b) Deconvolution of Ti 2p peaks. The results in Fig. 6 (a) can be used to check for impurities in the TiO2 thin film. The Ti:O ratio is maintained at around 1:1.8. Other impurities, such as carbon and nitrogen, do not exist in the thin film. The presence of carbon on the surface of the thin film surface is the diffusion of organic matter in the air as the thin film is exposed to the air. In other words, the XPS depth profile data confirm that a pure TiO2 thin film has been deposited. Additionally, deconvolution was performed to check the binding state of each element. As shown in Fig. 6 (b), the peak of Ti 2p is separated by three peaks, with the Ti4+ 2p1/2 peak (464.8 eV) and Ti4+ 2p3/2 (459.1 eV) peak from the typical TiO2 film separated by the main peak. The Ti3+ 2p1/2 peak (463.2 eV) and Ti3+ 2p3/2 peak (458.2 eV) are also separated. The binding energy difference between the separated Ti4+ 2p1/2 peak (464.8 eV) and Ti4+ 2p3/2 (459.1 eV) was 5.9 eV, similar to the difference between the previously reported Ti4+ 2p1/2 peak and Ti4+ 2p3/2 peak. It is reported that the Ti3+ 2p1/2 (463.2 eV) peak and Ti3+ 2p3/2 (458.2 eV) further separated because the surface is etched and analyzed thinly during the XPS analysis, so TiO2 is deoxidized by the impact of Ar ions (28–30). The XPS data of O 1s. Here, peaks representing Ti-O (529.9 eV) binding were mainly found (data not shown) (30). In other words, looking at Ti 2p and O 1s XPS spectra, we can confirm that a pure TiO2 thin film has been formed. The authors would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused. © 2022"
"“Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)” is a self-configurable, self-repairing, self-maintaining, highly mobile, decentralized, and independent wireless network, which has the liberty to move from one to another place. Such networks do not have any pre-existing infrastructure. The adoption of a smart environment in MANET requires new protocols to connect the gadgets to the internet. A smart environment with routing protocols should assure the following properties like connectivity among the nodes, “Quality of Service (QoS)”, and fairness, both in access points and ad-hoc networks. Combination with the Internet of Things (IoT) and MANET generates a novel MANET-IoT system, which focuses on reducing the implementing costs of the network and providing better mobility for users. The necessity of these integrated networks is increasing in military operations, rescue operations, personal area networks, emergency rooms, and meeting rooms. Routing in MANETs is a not simple job and has projected a huge range of attention from researchers around the world. Thus, the intention of this task is a development of a security protocol in MANET for the IoT platform. For dealing with encryption and decryption strategies to handle MANET and IoT data, a new approach is suggested through the enhanced chaotic map. Here, three improved algorithms are implemented for proposing the optimized key management scheme under a chaotic map, which is the Modified Updating-based Harris Hawks Optimization Algorithm (MU-HHO), Mean Solution-based Averaging Sailfish Optimizer (MS-ASFO), Adaptive Basic Reproduction Rate-based Coronavirus Herd Immunity Optimizer (ABRR-CHIO). In the convergence evaluation, while taking the length of plain text as 40, ABRR-CHIO shows superior performance over other techniques at the 60th iteration, which is 96%, 95%, 93%, 96%, and 80% superior to HHO, SFO, CHIO, SA-SFO, and CHHSO. Finally, the performance evaluation is performed regarding “statistical analysis, convergence analysis, and communication overhead” to reveal the superiority of the designed model. © 2022"
"Purpose: Before the COVID-19 pandemic, the last time a crisis affected businesses worldwide by putting economies into hibernation was in 1918 – the Great Influenza Pandemic. Environmental, social and governance frameworks require businesses to respond to such crises as it significantly changes the business environment. With approximately 2.84 million accountants existing across 130 countries, this study aims to determine whether the accounting profession responded to this crisis. As these responses can provide insights into the type of activities accountants performed during the lockdown, the authors analysed them for emerging themes and identified changes in the way that accountants performed tasks. Design/methodology/approach: Using search engines, the authors examined publicly available secondary sources such as websites of professional bodies, the Big Four and mid-tier accounting firms and government organisations using the keyword “COVID-19” to identify responses on issues faced by accountants during the 2020 lockdown period in New Zealand. The authors used interpretive text analysis to examine the responses for emerging themes. Findings: The accountants’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic emphasised information technology and soft skills but most importantly the interaction, integration and immersion of technical skills with information technology and soft skills. The findings also highlight changes in the way accountants performed their tasks. Originality/value: The study insights enable accounting academics to better understand the interconnection between hard and soft skills for incorporating it in syllabi, thereby preparing students for future roles. In addition, the study findings will assist both practitioners and researchers to explore the emerging changes in the way accountants perform their tasks. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The fortune of Giovanni Pascoli is particularly controversial; data from a research carried in 2014 show that the poet does not enjoy excessive popularity among students of literary subjects, while the results of research at international level (2018) reflect that Pascoli’s work has had a discreet fortune among writers and intellectuals of the 20th and 21st centuries, for he was very popular in Spain among members of the socio-cultural movement known as “Noucentisme”. The aim of this article is to analyse the poetic versions of the volume Fragmentos de Giovanni Pascoli (López Rico 2018), as it represents the only anthology highlighting the most complex aspects of the author’s poetics. Such elements have remained hidden from readers in previous versions, due to the translators’ literal and prose-like approach, focusing mainly content, and not giving too much weight to fundamental elements of Pascoli’s style such as his rigorous attention to rhythm, metre and rhyme. In the volume Fragmentos de Giovanni Pascoli, attention to these important aspects has been made possible thanks to the different techniques used to achieve in the target text the equivalent effects as in the original text. The metatext has been conceived following the idea of translation as a process to be interpreted in terms of exchange in the field of intercultural rela-tions, with a focus on the activity of rewriting; furthermore, it has been intended as transfer according to the theory of polysystems and literary criticism in terms of translation (Even-Zohar 1979; 1990; 1990; 1997), preferring a more open perception of the study of reception and empirical research (the difference between his-torical-descriptive research and the multiplicity of elements or systems such as rules, models, guidelines or literary context of the target language through data analysis). The aim was to bridge theory and empirical data. The article presents some examples of the main problems that have arisen while translating Pascoli’s complex poetry, whether in terms of structure, sign, personality, linguistics, or culture; it shows how they have been tackled and what techniques and methods have been used in order to respect as many elements as possible. © 2023, CRET (University of Barcelona).

"Understanding job requirements is essential for establishing and optimizing employability-oriented education programs. Most relevant research focus on clarifying the skill requirement of an occupational field. In this research, we argue that job tasks serve as a bridge between a job and the required skills, and we provide a method for investigating the job-task-skill pattern of job requirements using text mining on publicly available job advertisements. To provide this, we: 1) collect data on thousands of job advertisements through web crawling and scraping; 2) categorize the jobs through title analysis; 3) identify the topic of both tasks and skills through word co-occurrence network clustering; and 4) systematically analyze the characteristics and internal relationships between job roles, tasks, and the required skills. A test case was conducted in the context of China's big data sector, and the findings show that the proposed strategy is viable, practical, and instructive.  © 2023 ACM."
"Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) offers management researchers an approach which allows deep examination of the relationship between individuals and their environments, particularly in complex social situations. Phenomenology studies phenomena, or things and events, as they are perceived by people’s consciousness. Interpretivism allows researchers to access such internal awareness of research participants by attempting to understand the words used by subjects to describe their experiences and perceptions. Inherently subjective, this approach requires self-awareness by the researcher and the willingness to abandon preconceived notions in favor of interactive listening and exploration, relying on terms and concepts volunteered by participants rather than nominated by theory or preceding literature. Qualitative text analysis software can be utilized to facilitate aggregation and distillation of the voluminous narratives that result from the open-ended semi-structured interviews typically employed to collect data for IPA. However, impartiality and discernment on the part of the researcher remain essential in interpreting any automated analytical results. The researcher becomes in essence a second-hand observer, peering through windows voluntarily opened by participants, attempting to understand their understanding of their world. This chapter introduces IPA, providing an overview of its rationale and approach, and illustrates its application in a management-related setting, focusing on cultural adaptation of immigrant professionals. © 2023 by Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The aim of this longitudinal study is to investigate the effects of early literacy skills on beginning to read in a transparent orthography, viz. Turkish. In line with this aim, a total of eighty-four participants were followed from preschool to the end of the first grade and the extent to which participants' early literacy skills in the preschool period predict their future reading performances was examined. All the data gathered in the study were collected individually at one-year intervals. The participants’ early literacy skills were tested by the ""Test of Early Literacy (TEL)"", reading comprehension skills was obtained with a text containing 162 words and 10 multiple choice questions, reading fluency performances were calculated with the formula of correct number of words per minute. Data were computed through correlation analysis, and hierarchical regression analysis. Results suggest that regarding phonological awareness, early literacy sub-skills, especially those contributing to or serving oral comprehension had positive effects on reading fluency and reading comprehension at the end of the first grade. Valuable conclusions have been drawn from this finding about the role of phonological awareness, and its contribution to reading in an agglutinative orthography such as Turkish. Obtained results are discussed in relation to the literature. © 2023, Ozgen Korkmaz. All rights reserved."
"— Digital interaction has become more prevalent as a result of the increasing development of social Media and Web, making the customer active players. Customers' reviews uploaded on the Internet today provide crucial data towards other clients due to the vast quantity of reviews provided by consumers today. Since this type of information is extremely important for decision-making, it is extremely popular among internet users. Because of this, an automation system to analyses and retrieve insight from textual data is required. Sentiment classification is a well-known sub-area of Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing that studies how people feel (NLP). The sentiments of participants in previous studies were calculated without taking into account the aspects indicated in a reviewing instances. In recent years, scholars have become interested in aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). Numerous existing systems treat ABSA as if it were a single-label classification problem. This issue is addressed in this paper by presenting ways that make use of multilabeling classifiers for classification, which overcomes the problem. So rather than single label classifiers, the suggested approach employs the upgraded BERT system just for word embedding, with classification performed using multilabeling classifiers rather than single label classifiers. According to all methodologies, the label that is utilised for all learning classifiers identifies aspects by expressing their emotions. In this technique, the findings achieved via experimentation show that they are superior to the findings acquired through other existing researches when employing the system provided in this approach. © 2023, Ismail Saritas.

"In recent years, matrix factorization-based techniques have received much attention in the data analysis field since it can perform dimensionality reduction and clustering simultaneously. Despite the great success achieved by the Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and concept factorization (CF) methods, they suffer from the out-of-sample problem and are sensitive to the noise. Some recent studies have indicated that the similarity relationship is capable of revealing the local structure. In this paper, a similarity graph is constructed to reflect the geometric information of manifold structure, while the concept factorization is employed to capture the global structure. In addition, the projection matrix is incorporated into the concept factorization model to eliminate the noise and avoid the out-of-sample problem. An iterative algorithm is introduced to solve the model. The experimental results obtained on both human face and text data sets verify the high efficiency of the proposed method. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."

"Background: Construction business is currently the second greatest source of injuries in Ethiopia after automotive accidents, with a risk of fatality that is five times higher than that of other industrial sectors. To establish measures for injury prevention, it is crucial to assess the severity of occupational injuries and identify the variables that contribute to them. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the magnitude and factors associated with occupational injuries among Bure Industrial Park construction workers, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 372 construction workers at Bure Industrial Park. The study participants were selected using a simple random sampling method. The data were collected using interviewer-administered structured questionnaire and work environment observation using structured checklist. In the descriptive statistic, frequencies, proportion, and mean were calculated and the results of the analysis were presented in text and tables. The bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were carried out to identify independent factors having associations with the occurrence of occupational injury. Results: The overall prevalence of occupational injuries among Bure industrial park construction workers was 39.4%, 95%C.I (34.4%-44.4%). Factors such as sex (being male) [AOR = 1.74, 95%CI (1.02–2.97)], being married [AOR = 2.79, 95%CI (1.50–5.17)], no use of personal protective equipment [AOR = 1.67, 95%CI (1.12–2.85)], no training on occupational safety [AOR = 1.45, 95%CI (1.06–2.98)], and not satisfied with the job [AOR = 5.97, 95%CI (3.48–10.2)] were the factors associated with occupational injuries. Conclusion and recommendation: The finding shows the public health importance of occupational injury among construction workers in the study area. Numerous factors have been linked to workplace injuries, including sex, marital status, the usage of personal protection equipment, training in occupational safety, and job satisfaction. As a result, in order to lower the rate of occupational injury, employers should prioritize offering safety training, encouraging the use of personal protective equipment while working, conducting routine workplace inspections, and ensuring that their staff members are happy at work by providing comfortable workspaces.

"Purpose: Casting is one of the well-known manufacturing processes to make durable parts of goods and machinery. However, the quality of the casting parts depends on the proper choice of process variables related to properties of the materials used in making a mold and the product itself; hence, variables related to product/process designs are taken into consideration. Understanding casting techniques considering significant process variables is critical to achieving better quality castings and helps to improve the productivity of the casting processes. This study aims to understand the computational models developed for achieving better quality castings using various casting techniques. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic literature review is conducted in the field of casting considering the period 2000–2020. The keyword co-occurrence network and word cloud from the bibliometric analysis and text mining of the articles reveal that optimization and simulation models are extensively developed for various casting techniques, including sand casting, investment casting, die casting and squeeze casting, to improve quality aspects of the casting's product. This study further investigates the optimization and simulation models and has identified various process variables involved in each casting technique that are significantly affecting the outcomes of the processes in terms of defects, mechanical properties, yield, dimensional accuracy and emissions. Findings: This study has drawn out the need for developing smart casting environments with data-driven modeling that will enable dynamic fine-tuning of the casting processes and help in achieving desired outcomes in today's competitive markets. This study highlights the possible technology interventions across the metal casting processes, which can further enhance the quality of the metal casting products and productivity of the casting processes, which show the future scope of this field. Research limitations/implications: This paper investigates the body of literature on the contributions of various researchers in producing high-quality casting parts and performs bibliometric analysis on the articles. However, research articles from high-quality journals are considered for the literature analysis in identifying the critical parameters influencing quality of metal castings. Originality/value: The systematic literature review reveals the analytical models developed using simulation and optimization techniques and the important quality characteristics of the casting products. Further, the study also explores critical influencing parameters involved in every casting process that significantly affects the quality characteristics of the metal castings. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The paper focuses on the systematization of approaches to studying the notions idiolect and idiostyle undertaken by Ukrainian and foreign researchers; the characteristic features of these terms and the criteria for their differentiation are also clarified. The selected material was traced through by applying descriptive and context-interpretation methods, which were supplemented by involving the analysis of psychological resources. The author gives an analysis of the definitions cited from reputable sources as dictionaries and encyclopedias as well as various papers and dissertation theses. It is proved that even in the most authoritative publications, the terms idiolect and idiostyle are identified. The basic reasons calling on the identification of the terms are defined, while the main distinctions as to their interpretation and parallel term applications are demonstrated as well. The social nature and the linguistic character of the idiolect are analyzed, so far it is stated that for the purpose of characterizing the idiolect of the linguistic personality, the attention is to be drawn to the set of linguistic factors intrinsic to the speech of individuals, while the description of idiostyle is based on the system of semantic correlations, subjective reflections, manner of modelling the artistic world and ornamentalistics, as they are incarnated by linguistic devices. It is pointed out that idiostyle has a broader range of application than idiolect. The author favours the viewpoint of the linguists who interpret idiolect as a component of idiostyle (e.g. Lesia Stavytska, Svitlana Yermolenko, Viktor Hryhoriev, and Pavlo Hrytsenko). Linguocultural, sociolinguistic, stylistic, and linguocognitive approaches are singled out, since they are used for a multi-faceted interpretation of idiolect, while semantic-stylistic, linguopoetical, systemic-structural, communicative-functional, and cognitive aspects as productive elements are applied for the study of idiostyle. The attention is drawn to the fact that the psycholinguistic aspect of studying idiolect and idiostyle is still not thoroughly elaborated on. The author gives her own definition of idiolect with reference to the psycholinguistic theory. The parameters of idiostyle within the psycholinguistic sphere are detailed: in particular, 1) the emotional characteristics of the text, 2) the positioning of the author within the text content, 3) the dominating emotional-semantic elements, 4) the value-based psychological guidelines of the individuals, and 5) the devices of impact on the recipients. It is considered that in the future, it is necessary to elaborate more deeply on the analyzed phenomena by applying the theory of linguistic personality and the theory of psychological parameters of text analysis. © 2022 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest."
"The use of legislative histories under intentionalist/purposivist theories of statutory interpretation is frequently criticized because it can be easily biased (see, e.g., Scheppele, 2012). To date, corpus-based statutory interpretation has relied almost exclusively on textualist theory of legal interpretation. However, corpus linguistic methods are not necessarily bound to any one theory (e.g., Biber & Reppen, 2015). The present study analyses two legislative histories as corpora and compares them against a general corpus of English to determine if interpretative theory makes a meaningful difference in two example cases (Costello v. United States, 2012; Taniguchi v. Kan Saipan Pacific, 2012). Senses of relevant terms were manually annotated by two independent human coders with high interrater reliability in the two types of corpora. The results indicate that a legislative history corpus can reveal multiple patterns of lexical meaning and produce unbiased and distributional results rather than a single biased data point as most legislative history analyses do. These two case studies show significant and meaningful differences in both cases using Fisher’s Exact Test (Costello, p < 0.0001, Cramer’s V = 0.70; Taniguchi, p < 0.0001, Cramer’s V = 0.53) between using a legislative history corpus versus a general language corpus. These results indicate that intentionalist/purposivist methods can be improved by using corpus-based analyses as well as the fact that intentionalist/purposivist and textualist theories produce practical semantic distinctions in legal interpretive settings due to the differences in relevant texts, registers, and speech communities. © 2023, Language and Law Editorial Office.

"Ethnopharmacological relevance: Anadenanthera colubrina (Vell.) Brenan is an endemic tree to South America and different parts of it are used by the population for the treatment of various diseases, as well as in indigenous rituals. This species has high pharmacological potential but may present toxic potential due to the presence of psychotropic compounds. Aim of the study: To review published studies with the species A. colubrina regarding ethnobotanical, phytochemical, pharmacological and toxicological aspects, as well as discuss perspectives for new research and protection of this species. Materials and methods: A literature review was performed by accessing published articles on databases such as: PubMed, Science Direct, Scielo, Scopus, Taylor and Francis online, Springer Link, National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), ACS Publications, Chemspider and Google Scholar. The keywords used were: “Anadenanthera colubrina” or “Mimosa colubrina” or “Piptadenia colubrina” or “Piptadenia macrocarpa” or “Piptadenia grata” or “Anadenanthera macrocarpa” and “medicinal plants” or “pharmacological” or “phytochemicals” or “traditional use” or “toxicological” or “ethnobotanical” or “pre-clinical trial” or “clinical”. Articles found by database searches and search engines were screened at four stages: (i) title screening, (ii) locality screening, (iii) abstract screening, and (iv) full text. Other articles found through supplementary searches were screened in the full text whenever available. Each article was assessed by three reviewers at the title and abstract screening stages, except for those found in Portuguese databases that were assessed by the native reviewer. Results: This robust tree has been popularly useful for agroeconomic, medicinal and as a hallucinogen in religious rituals. According to the published studies, the main parts of the plant are the bark and seeds that are mostly used for respiratory conditions and as entheogens, respectively. It is a rich traditional herbal medicine with many pharmacological properties such as anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, antidiarrheal, wound healing, antimicrobial, antitumoral, antioxidant, antiaddictive, insecticide and allelopathic that were described in in vitro and in vivo assays, and approximately 56 compounds were identified, suggesting a therapeutic potential for this species. Although most relate to medicinal uses, these are preliminaries and do not show the mechanism of action. The phytochemical assays showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, triterpenes, steroids and alkaloids. Some of the compounds are anadanthoflavone, which is exclusive to this species, and no pharmacological or toxicological studies have yet demonstrated this compound. Another important compound is bufotenine which was isolated from seeds and is related to hallucinogenic and antiviral activity. The extracts made from leaves, bark, gum, and fruits appear to be safe, according to both in vivo and in vitro toxicology testing, which all shown low toxicity. Due to the presence of bufotenine in the seeds, it can be toxic, however, it was not found in toxicological assays with the seed extracts. Conclusions: Therefore, part of the studies confirms the popular use of A. colubrina, however, more assays with isolated compounds and with the different extracts are necessary to corroborate other uses and the mechanism of action of their pharmacological effects needs to discuss in more detail. Therefore, the present review would be identified the gaps and suggests further studies oriented to validate the popular use. Thus, it must be noted that the use of this species must be controlled in order to minimize the environmental impact, as most of the pharmacological potential was shown with the bark and seeds. Due to its wide use in folk medicine, it is part of the Brazilian medicinal species with priority for conservation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Depression is the primary cause of illness and injury in the country, with over 280 million people suffering from it as per the 2021 survey. Depression is one of the most common psychiatric illnesses in the world, affecting millions of people. Early detection of major depression symptoms and treatment with timely intervention can help to prevent the emergence of major depression. This has generated the need for some novel techniques to be utilized for depression detection to help doctors in diagnosing and treating depression effectively. Depression can be investigated through online posts, audio files, facial expressions, as well as through video files. In this regard, the research presents a detailed survey of the existing machine learning methods in depression detection, along with the different datasets available. The research explores automated depression detection strategies and the various ways to detect depression from text, audio, and video, and even examines the various systems and procedures for detecting depression using various criteria. More than 140 related research articles were considered for this review, with 80 of them being processed for comparative analysis based on various key performance indicators. The classifications of various methods used to detect stress, anxiety, and depression are highlighted followed by open research challenges and issues while analyzing depression techniques. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women. The incidence and morbidity of BC are expected to rise rapidly. The stage at which BC is diagnosed has a significant impact on clinical outcomes. When detected early, an overall 5-year survival rate of up to 90% is possible. Although numerous studies have been conducted to assess the prognostic and diagnostic values of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in breast cancer, their overall potential remains unclear. In this field of study, there are various systematic reviews and meta-analysis studies that report volumes of data. In this study, we tried to collect all these systematic reviews and meta-analysis studies in order to re-analyze their data without any restriction to breast cancer or non-coding RNA type, to make it as comprehensive as possible. Methods: Three databases, namely, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (WoS), were searched to find any relevant meta-analysis studies. After thoroughly searching, the screening of titles, abstracts, and full-text and the quality of all included studies were assessed using the AMSTAR tool. All the required data including hazard ratios (HRs), sensitivity (SENS), and specificity (SPEC) were extracted for further analysis, and all analyses were carried out using Stata. Results: In the prognostic part, our initial search of three databases produced 10,548 articles, of which 58 studies were included in the current study. We assessed the correlation of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) expression with different survival outcomes in breast cancer patients: overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.521), disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 1.33), recurrence-free survival (RFS) (HR = 1.66), progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 1.71), metastasis-free survival (MFS) (HR = 0.90), and disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR = 0.37). After eliminating low-quality studies, the results did not change significantly. In the diagnostic part, 22 articles and 30 datasets were retrieved from 8,453 articles. The quality of all studies was determined. The bivariate and random-effects models were used to assess the diagnostic value of ncRNAs. The overall area under the curve (AUC) of ncRNAs in differentiated patients is 0.88 (SENS: 80% and SPEC: 82%). There was no difference in the potential of single and combined ncRNAs in differentiated BC patients. However, the overall potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) is higher than that of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). No evidence of publication bias was found in the current study. Nine miRNAs, four lncRNAs, and five gene targets showed significant OS and RFS between normal and cancer patients based on pan-cancer data analysis, demonstrating their potential prognostic value. Conclusion: The present umbrella review showed that ncRNAs, including lncRNAs and miRNAs, can be used as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer patients, regardless of the sample sources, ethnicity of patients, and subtype of breast cancer.

"OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize clinical subgroups of hospitalized Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic health records of hospitalized COVID-19 patients at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center were temporally sequenced and transformed into patient vector representations using Paragraph Vector models. K-means clustering was performed to identify subgroups. RESULTS: A diverse cohort of 11 313 patients with COVID-19 and hospitalizations between March 2, 2020 and December 1, 2021 were identified; median [IQR] age: 61.2 [40.3-74.3]; 51.5% female. Twenty subgroups of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, labeled by increasing severity, were characterized by their demographics, conditions, outcomes, and severity (mild-moderate/severe/critical). Subgroup temporal patterns were characterized by the durations in each subgroup, transitions between subgroups, and the complete paths throughout the course of hospitalization. DISCUSSION: Several subgroups had mild-moderate severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections but were hospitalized for underlying conditions (pregnancy, cardiovascular disease [CVD], etc.). Subgroup 7 included solid organ transplant recipients who mostly developed mild-moderate or severe disease. Subgroup 9 had a history of type-2 diabetes, kidney and CVD, and suffered the highest rates of heart failure (45.2%) and end-stage renal disease (80.6%). Subgroup 13 was the oldest (median: 82.7 years) and had mixed severity but high mortality (33.3%). Subgroup 17 had critical disease and the highest mortality (64.6%), with age (median: 68.1 years) being the only notable risk factor. Subgroups 18-20 had critical disease with high complication rates and long hospitalizations (median: 40+ days). All subgroups are detailed in the full text.

"Objective: The objective of this scoping review was to explore how absorptive capacity has been conceptualized and measured in studies of innovation adoption in health care organizations. Introduction: Current literature highlights the need to incorporate knowledge translation processes at the organizational and system level to enhance the adoption of new knowledge into practice. Absorptive capacity is a set of routines and processes characterized by knowledge acquisition, assimilation, transformation, and application. A key concept in organizational learning theory, absorptive capacity is thought to be critical to the adoption of new knowledge and innovations in organizations. To understand how absorptive capacity was conceptualized and measured in health care organizations, it was appropriate to conduct a scoping review to answer our research question. Inclusion criteria: This scoping review included published and unpublished primary studies (ie, experimental, quasi-experimental, observational, and qualitative study designs), as well as reviews that broadly focused on the adoption of innovations at the organizational level in health care, and framed innovation adoption as processes that rely on organizational learning and absorptive or learning capacity. Methods: Searches included electronic databases (ie, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Scopus) and gray literature, as well as reference scanning of relevant studies. Study abstracts and full texts were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Data extraction of relevant studies was also done independently by two reviewers. All discrepancies were addressed through discussion or adjudicated by a third reviewer. Synthesis of the extracted data focused on descriptive frequencies and counts of the results. This review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR). Results: The search strategies identified a total of 7433 citations. Sixteen papers were identified for inclusion, including a set of two companion papers, and data were extracted from 15 studies. We synthesized the objectives of the included studies and identified that researchers focused on at least one of the following aspects: i) exploring pre-existing capacity that affects improvement and innovation in health care settings; ii) describing factors influencing the spread and sustainability of organizations; iii) identifying measures and testing the knowledge application process; and iv) providing construct clarity. No new definitions were identified within this review; instead existing definitions were refined to suit the local context of the health care organization in which they were used. Conclusions: Given the rapidly changing and evolving nature of health care, it is important to understand both current best practices and an organization's ability to acquire, assimilate, transform, and apply these practices to their specific organization. While much research has gone into developing ways to implement knowledge translation, understanding an organization's internal structures and framework for seeking out and implementing new evidence as it relates to absorptive capacity is still a relatively novel concept.  © 2022 JBI."
"Introduction: The highly public nature of cybersuicide contradicts long-held beliefs of offline suicide, which may cause differences in the way people perceive and respond to both of them. However, knowledge of whether and how suicide literacy differs between cybersuicide and offline suicide is limited. Methods: By analyzing social media data, this paper focused on livestreamed suicide and aimed to compare suicide literacy between cybersuicide and offline suicide on three aspects, including false knowledge structure, extent of association with stigma, and linguistic expression pattern. 7,236 Sina Weibo posts with relevant keywords were downloaded and analyzed. First, a content analysis was performed by human coders to determine whether each post reflected suicide-related false knowledge and stigma. Second, a text analysis was conducted using the Simplified Chinese version of LIWC software to automatically extract psycholinguistic features from each post. Third, based on selected features, classification models were developed using machine learning techniques to differentiate false knowledge of cybersuicide from that of offline suicide. Results: Results showed that, first, cybersuicide-related posts generally reflected more false knowledge than offline suicide-related posts ((Formula presented.) 255.13, p < 0.001). Significant differences were also observed in seven false knowledge types. Second, among posts reflecting false knowledge, cybersuicide-related posts generally carried more stigma than offline suicide-related posts ((Formula presented.) = 116.77, p < 0.001). Significant differences were also observed in three false knowledge types. Third, among established classification models, the highest F1 value reached 0.70. Discussion: The findings provide evidence of differences in suicide literacy between cybersuicide and offline suicide, and indicate the need for public awareness campaigns that specifically target cybersuicide.

"This paper examines the role of music in L. Ulitskaya’s novels. It is clear from Ulitskaya’s statements that music has played an extremely important role in her life, which is reflected in her oeuvre: music as a theme and an aspect of the heroes’ lives is a fundamental factor in many of her works. This paper tries to explore the poetic function of music in these works. Based on the analysis of The Funeral Party, The Kukotsky Enigma, The Big Green Tent, and Yakov’s Ladder, three basic aspects of this function can be distinguished: the creation of a referential background, the creation of a specific musical discourse, and the structuring of the different levels of the text. The creation of the referential background is linked to the shaping of the world of the heroes: the activities of some heroes take place in real places (music schools, concert halls, etc.) specific to a given historical period and linked to specific works by specific composers. Musicians who have played an important role in Russian culture served as prototypes for several of these heroes. Ulitskaya’s musician heroes relate to music in a variety of ways: as a recipient, as a creator, or as a theoretician, and they all recognize music as a principle of life. The formulation of feelings and ideas about music, taken as a whole, creates a well-defined musical discourse in the works, which interacts with other discourses (e.g. scientific, religious, etc.) related to non-musician heroes. The creation of a referential background in itself is not, and the musical discourse is only partly an intermediary phenomenon. The interaction between music and literature as two artistic disciplines is most evident in the use of musical structures. The paper presents two examples where the macro- and micro-structures of texts are organized by the principle of the musical rondo. In The Funeral Party, the alternation of the present of the protagonist’s dying and of past episodes related to minor characters constitute the musical rondo form, while in an episode of The Big Green Tent, the rondo form is drawn from the alternation of different forms of utterance (the narrator’s voice / the hero’s inner voice / the interweaving of the narrator’s voice and the hero’s voice). All in all, Ulitskaya’s works make extremely varied use of the literary representation of music. The musical world created in them, which is specific to a limited part of the plot, is presented in conjunction with other segments of culture and their modes of representation, resulting in a very rich, syncretic poetics of the novels. © 2022 The Author."
"Objectives: To determine the combined impact of provider-facing and text message-based, patient nudges on herpes zoster vaccine series completion. Methods: Following a period during which Kroger Health implemented provider facing nudges, select US patients that initiated herpes zoster vaccination were randomized to receive timed text messages when the second dose was due and available as part of a quality improvement exercise. Main comparisons were between patients intervened by provider nudge only and those intervened by both provider and patient nudges. Data were assessed by GEE-based logistic and linear regression, controlling for available patient- and store-level characteristics, and geospatial analyses. Results: During the baseline period, 100,627 adults received at least one HZ vaccine dose and 83.9% completed the series within 6 months over 88.6 days (SD: 26.53) on average. In the intervention period, 120,339 adults were vaccinated at least once and series completion was 88.3% (both provider nudges and text messaging) and 85.3% (not texted) during this observation window (both p < 0.0001). Time between doses was shorter for those who received text messages compared to both the baseline period and those in the intervention period that were not texted (both p < 0.001). Controlling for multiple characteristics, the odds of completion improved in the intervention period compared to baseline (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.033–1.111), but a noticeably higher completion odds was observed amongst patients who received a text message in the intervention period (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.286–1.414). Adjusting for patient and pharmacy factors, those who were texted received their second herpes zoster vaccine dose 8.6 days sooner (95% CI: −9.08 - −8.17, p < 0.0001) compared to those intervened by the provider nudge only. Conclusion: The combined use of clinical and patient-focused nudges is a simple mechanism by which pharmacies and other health care access points can address the multi-dose vaccine needs of diverse patient populations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the link between downsizing cues and market performance prior to and after a major crisis. We use a recent exogenous shock – the COVID-19 pandemic – to test hypotheses on the nature of the relationship between downsizing cues and market performance within two distinct groups: pre and post-crisis. We purport that the sudden increase in uncertainty brought about by a major crisis widens information asymmetry between firms and their shareholders, and that top managers sending downsizing cues to the market with high levels of authenticity may be more likely to trigger positive market reactions. Design/methodology/approach: The authors rely on computer-assisted text analysis (CATA) methodology, event-study methodology and a data set of 952 pre- and post-crisis earnings conference calls held by 476 S&P 500 firms to test the hypotheses in this study. Findings: The authors find that downsizing cues have no effect on market performance in the pre-crisis group, but are negatively related to market performance in the post-crisis group. The authors also find that authenticity cues positively mitigate the relationship between downsizing cues and market performance relationship in the post-crisis group. Originality/value: This empirical study extends our knowledge of the influence of a major crisis on the relationship between downsizing and market performance by leveraging the revelatory power of an exogenous environmental shock. The authors also explore the role played by managerial authenticity and find that the market is more inclined to accept post-crisis downsizing efforts when top managers are perceived as authentic. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Knowledge graph can effectively manage massive information and deal with complex and diverse relationships. At the same time, knowledge search and decision-making based on knowledge graph are more in line with human logic and enhance the interpretability of answers. Since the current power transformer operations mainly depends on traditional experience, and has accumulated the massive operations within the power system documentation and the accident report, it is an urgent need to solve the problem on how to read the vast amounts of data quickly and accurately extract the valuable information, so as to use data-driven approach to transformer intelligent operations. Therefore, this paper proposes an ALBERT based knowledge graph construction method for power transformer operation and maintenance. First of all, due to the small number of publicly available operation and maintenance documents and accident handling reports in the field of power transformer operation and maintenance, it is necessary to build a training dataset for the field of power transformer. The construction process of the dataset is divided into two parts. The first part is to generate samples of the obtained fault analysis report, anomaly detection report and other texts on basis of the method of regular matching rules. The second part is to clean the obtained literature texts and annotate the processed texts with BIO method. Then, the ALBERT-BiLSTM-CRF model was used to extract entities from the operation and maintenance texts of power transformers, and the ALBERT-BiLSTM-Attention model is used to extract relations from the operation and maintenance texts of power transformers. Finally, the Neo4j graph database is used to store and visualize the extracted triple. In the light of the constructed knowledge graph of power transformer operation and maintenance, the auxiliary decision-making function of power transformer operation and maintenance can be realized. The ALBERT-BiLSTM-CRF model and ALBERT-BiLSTM-Attention model are used to conduct relation extraction experiments on the operation and maintenance texts of power transformers respectively. The accuracy of entity extraction using the ALBERT-BiLSTM-CRF model can reach 94.4%. The F1 score can reach 94.2%, which is 9.1% and 7.9% higher than BiLSTM-CRF respectively. The accuracy of ALBERT-BiLSTM-Attention model can reach 94.1%, and the F1 score can reach 95.1%, which are improved by 3.2% and 2.5% compared with the BiLSTM-Attention model. From the experimental results, it shows that the ALBERT pre-trained model has a good adaptability to extract entities and relations for power transformer operation and maintenance, and can better complete the task of knowledge extraction. To sum up, this paper proposes a knowledge graph construction method of power transformer operation and maintenance based on ALBERT model. The main conclusions are as follows: ① A training dataset of power transformer operation and maintenance text is constructed based on Selenium framework and the sample generation method of regular matching, which effectively solves the difficult problem of obtaining data sets in the field of power transformer operation and maintenance. ② The ALBERT-BiLSTM-CRF model and ALBERT-BiLSTM-Attention model are used to extract entities and relations from the operation and maintenance texts of power transformers. Compared with the traditional deep learning model, ALBERT model can effectively overcome the problems in power transformer operation and maintenance texts, such as too many proper nouns, letters and symbols among Chinese characters. ③ Based on the constructed power transformer operation and maintenance knowledge graph, the operation and maintenance auxiliary decision-making function can be realized, which provides a new idea for the intelligent operation and maintenance of power transformers. © 2023 Chinese Machine Press.

"Some scholars build models to classify documents into chosen categories. Others, especially social scientists who tend to focus on population characteristics, instead usually estimate the proportion of documents in each category - using either parametric classify-and-count methods or direct nonparametric estimation of proportions without individual classification. Unfortunately, classify-and-count methods can be highly model-dependent or generate more bias in the proportions even as the percent of documents correctly classified increases. Direct estimation avoids these problems, but can suffer when the meaning of language changes between training and test sets or is too similar across categories. We develop an improved direct estimation approach without these issues by including and optimizing continuous text features, along with a form of matching adapted from the causal inference literature. Our approach substantially improves performance in a diverse collection of 73 datasets. We also offer easy-to-use software that implements all ideas discussed herein.  © 2022 The Author(s)."
"Purpose: In recent years, significant research has focused on the question of whether severe market periods are accompanied by herding behavior. As herding behavior is a considerable cause of the speculative bubble and leads to stock market deviations from their basic values it is necessary to examine the motivators which led to herding behavior among investors. The paper aims to discuss this issue. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors performed a two-phase analysis to address the research questions of the study. In the first phase, for text analysis NVivo software was used to identify the factors driving herding behavior among Indian stock investors. The analysis of a text was performed using word frequency analysis. While in the second phase, the Fuzzy-AHP analysis techniques were employed to examine the relative importance of all the factors determined and assign priorities to the factors extracted. Findings: Results of the study depicted Investor Cognitive Psychology (ICP), Market Information (MI), Stock Characteristics (SC) as the top-ranked factors driving herding behavior, while Socio-Economic Factors (SEF) emerged as the least important factor driving herding behavior. Research limitations/implications: The current study was undertaken among stock investors from North India only. Moreover, numerous factors are not part of the study but might significantly influence the investors' herding behaviors. Practical implications: Comprehending the influences of the different factors discussed in the study would enable stock investors to be more aware of their investment choices and not resort to herd behavior. This research enables decision-makers to understand the reasons for herd activity and helps them act accordingly to improve the stock market's performance. Originality/value: The current study will provide an inclusive overview of herding behavior motivators among Indian stock investors. This study's results can be extremely useful for both academics and policymakers to gain some insight into the functioning of the Indian stock market. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Objective: Many studies have conflicting findings in using shear wave elastography (SWE) to assess renal fibrosis. This study reviews the use of SWE to evaluate pathological changes in native kidneys and renal allografts. It also tries to elucidate the confounding factors and care taken to ensure the results are consistent and reliable. Methods: The review was carried out according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines. Literature search was conducted in Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus database up to 23 October 2021. To evaluate risk and bias applicability, the Cochrane risk-of bias tool and GRADE was used. The review was registered under PROSPERO CRD42021265303. Results: A total of 2921 articles were identified. 104 full texts were examined and 26 studies included in systematic review. 11 studies performed on native kidneys and 15 studies on transplanted kidney. A wide range of impact factors was found that affect the accuracy of SWE of renal fibrosis in adult patients Conclusions: Compared to point SWE, two-dimensional SWE with elastogram could enable better selection of the region of interest in kidneys, leading to reproducible results. Tracking waves were attenuated as the depth from skin to region of interest increased, therefore, SWE is not recommended for overweight or obese patients. Variable transducer forces might also affect SWE reproducibility, thus, training of operators to ensure consistent operator-dependent transducer forces may be helpful. Advances in knowledge: This review provides a holistic insight on the efficiency of using SWE in evaluating pathological changes in native and transplanted kidneys, thereby contributing to the knowledge of its utilisation in clinical practice. © 2023 The Authors.

"The COVID-19 pandemic spurred some regulators in the USA to require occupational health and safety programs to prevent COVID-19 transmission in workplaces. The objective of this study was to describe such state and federal regulations enacted between January 2020 and January 2022. Regulations, including emergency temporary standards (ETS) and permanent standards, were identified through a search of Nexis Uni and Bloomberg Law and review of US OSHA websites and the Federal Register. Full texts were reviewed for regulatory scope, hazard and exposure definitions, determination of exposure or risk levels, and control strategies. Four state (California, Michigan, Virginia, and Oregon) and two federal regulations were identified. All regulations described respiratory aerosols as the primary source of SARS-CoV-2 and recognized person-to-person transmission by droplet, airborne, and contact routes. Only the US OSHA ETS for healthcare explicitly stated that inhalation of respiratory particles was the most likely method of COVID-19 transmission. The Virginia, Michigan, and Oregon regulations described different categories of risk defined by exposure frequency and duration or specific workplace activities. California described exposure as places and times when employees come into contact or congregate with other people. The US OSHA ETS for healthcare described exposure as involving close contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. While all of the state regulations required strategies from across the hierarchy, only the Virginia regulations specifically incorporated the hierarchy of controls. Only the California and Virginia regulations explicitly linked control strategies to the transmission route, while Virginia demarcated control strategies by risk level. Oregon linked risk level to occupancy levels and physical distancing requirements and referred to the use of a layered approach for transmission control. The US OSHA ETS for healthcare defined droplet and airborne precautions but made no mention of the hierarchy of controls or risk levels. Respirators were discussed in most of the regulations. The first Michigan regulation explicitly required respirators appropriate to exposure risk. The California regulations noted that respirators protect the wearer while face coverings protect people around the wearer. These regulations offer insights for a permanent US OSHA infectious disease regulation, such as the need to consider a range of transmission modes including near- and far-range aerosol inhalation, endemic and novel pathogens, workplaces beyond healthcare settings, factors that contribute to exposure and risk, the hierarchy of controls, the role of vaccination, and the importance of written exposure assessment and infection prevention plans. © The Author(s) 2022.

"Importance: Most regulated medical devices enter the US market via the 510(k) regulatory submission pathway, wherein manufacturers demonstrate that applicant devices are ""substantially equivalent"" to 1 or more ""predicate"" devices (legally marketed medical devices with similar intended use). Most recalled medical devices are 510(k) devices. Objective: To examine the association between characteristics of predicate medical devices and recall probability for 510(k) devices. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this exploratory cross-sectional analysis of medical devices cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) between 2003 and 2018 via the 510(k) regulatory submission pathway, linear probability models were used to examine associations between a 510(k) device's recall status and characteristics of its predicate medical devices. Public documents for the 510(k) medical devices were collected using FDA databases. A text extraction algorithm was applied to identify predicate medical devices cited in 510(k) regulatory submissions. Algorithm-derived metadata were combined with 2003-2020 FDA recall data. Exposures: Citation of predicate medical devices with certain characteristics in 510(k) regulatory submissions, including the total number of predicate medical devices cited by the applicant device, the age of the predicate medical devices, the lack of similarity of the predicate medical devices to the applicant device, and the recall status of the predicate medical devices. Main Outcomes and Measures: Class I or class II recall of a 510(k) medical device between its FDA regulatory clearance date and December 31, 2020. Results: The sample included 35176 medical devices, of which 4007 (11.4%) were recalled. The applicant devices cited a mean of 2.6 predicate medical devices, with mean ages of 3.6 years and 7.4 years for the newest and oldest, respectively, predicate medical devices. Of the applicant devices, 93.9% cited predicate medical devices with no ongoing recalls, 4.3% cited predicate medical devices with 1 ongoing class I or class II recall, 1.0% cited predicate medical devices with 2 ongoing recalls, and 0.8% cited predicate medical devices with 3 or more ongoing recalls. Applicant devices citing predicate medical devices with 3 or more ongoing recalls were significantly associated with a 9.31-percentage-point increase (95% CI, 2.84-15.77 percentage points) in recall probability compared with devices without ongoing recalls of predicate medical devices, or an 81.2% increase in recall probability relative to the mean recall probability. A 1-SD increase in the total number of predicate medical devices cited by the applicant device was significantly associated with a 1.25-percentage-point increase (95% CI, 0.62-1.87 percentage points) in recall probability, or an 11.0% increase in recall probability relative to the mean recall probability. A 1-SD increase in the newest age of a predicate medical device was significantly associated with a 0.78-percentage-point decrease (95% CI, 1.29-0.30 percentage points) in recall probability, or a 6.8% decrease in recall probability relative to the mean recall probability. Conclusions and Relevance: This exploratory cross-sectional study of 510(k) medical devices cleared by the FDA between 2003 and 2018 demonstrated significant associations between 510(k) submission characteristics and recalls of medical devices. Further research is needed to understand the implications of these associations. © 2023 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."
"Purpose: The study aimed to examine how different communities concerned with dementia engage and interact on Twitter. Design/methodology/approach: A dataset was sampled from 8,400 user profile descriptions, which was labelled into five categories and subjected to multiple machine learning (ML) classification experiments based on text features to classify user categories. Social network analysis (SNA) was used to identify influential communities via graph-based metrics on user categories. The relationship between bot score and network metrics in these groups was also explored. Findings: Classification accuracy values were achieved at 82% using support vector machine (SVM). The SNA revealed influential behaviour on both the category and node levels. About 2.19% suspected social bots contributed to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dementia discussions in different communities. Originality/value: The study is a unique attempt to apply SNA to examine the most influential groups of Twitter users in the dementia community. The findings also highlight the capability of ML methods for efficient multi-category classification in a crisis, considering the fast-paced generation of data.

"Aspect-based sentiment analysis aims to analyze the sentiment polarity of a given aspect. The graph convolutional neural network model is widely used. However, most existing research focuses on mining the context-word-to-aspect-word dependencies of dependency trees based on the sentence itself without using much text-related external knowledge. In addition, the problem of reasonably capturing words outside the multihop grammatical distance and edge label hinders the effect of GCN. This paper proposes a graph convolutional network that fuses external knowledge (sentiment lexicon and part-of-speech information) (EK-GCN). Specifically, we conduct a statistical study on part-of-speech and construct a part-of-speech matrix to fully consider the influence of denying words, degree words, and other words that affect sentiment expression in sentences on sentiment classification. Then, an external sentiment lexicon is used to assign sentiment scores to each word in the sentence to construct a sentiment score matrix to highlight the weight of sentiment words, which to a certain extent, compensates for the fact that the syntactic dependency tree cannot capture edge labels. In addition, we design a Word–Sentence Interaction Network (WSIN), which can fully consider the information of the current aspect word and interact with the context information of the reviews to filter useful sentence information. We conduct experiments on four benchmark datasets, and the excellent experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. The results also verify that fully integrating external knowledge can assist in completing aspect-based sentiment analysis tasks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of different pharmacologic treatment for severe hypertension during pregnancy. Methods: Two reviewers searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMbase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized clinical trials from the establishment of the database to 15 July 2021 that were eligible for inclusion and analyzed the pharmaceuticals used for severe hypertension in pregnancy. Results: 29 relevant trials with 2,521 participants were involved. Compared with diazoxide in rate of achieving target blood pressure, other pharmaceuticals, including epoprostenol (RR:1.58, 95%CI:1.01–2.47), hydralazine\dihydralazine (RR:1.57, 95%CI:1.07–2.31), ketanserin (RR:1.67, 95%CI:1.09–2.55), labetalol (RR:1.54, 95%CI:1.04–2.28), nifedipine (RR:1.54, 95%CI:1.04–2.29), and urapidil (RR:1.57, 95%CI:1.00–2.47), were statistically significant in the rate of achieving target blood pressure. According to the SUCRA, diazoxide showed the best therapeutic effect, followed by nicardipine, nifedipine, labetalol, and nitroglycerine. The three pharmaceuticals with the worst therapeutic effect were ketanserin, hydralazine, and urapidil. It is worth noting that the high ranking of the top two pharmaceuticals, including diazoxide and nicardipine, comes from extremely low sample sizes. Other outcomes were reported in the main text. Conclusion: This comprehensive network meta-analysis demonstrated that the nifedipine should be recommended as a strategy for blood pressure management in pregnant women with severe hypertension. Moreover, the conventional pharmaceuticals, including labetalol and hydralazine, showed limited efficacy. However, it was important to note that the instability of hydralazine reducing blood pressure and the high benefit of labetalol with high dosages intakes should also be of concern to clinicians.

"Purpose: The purpose of this study was to demonstrate a cloud business intelligence model for industrial SMEs. An initial model was developed to accomplish this, followed by validation and finalization of the cloud business intelligence model. Additionally, this research employs a mixed-techniques approach, including both qualitative and quantitative methods. This paper aims to achieve the following objectives: (1) Recognize the Cloud business intelligence concepts. (2) Identify the role of cloud BI in SMEs. (3) Identify the factors that affect the design and presenting a Cloud business intelligence model based on critical factors affecting SMEs during pandemic COVID-19. (4) Discuss the importance of Cloud BI in pandemic COVID-19 for SMEs. (5) Provide managerial implications for using Cloud BI effectively in Iran’s SMEs. Design/methodology/approach: In the current study, an initial model was first proposed, and the cloud business intelligence model was then validated and finalized. Moreover, this study uses a mixed-methods design in which both qualitative and quantitative methods are used. The fuzzy Delphi Method has been applied for parameter validation purposes, and eventually, the Cloud business intelligence model has been presented through exploiting the interpretive structural modeling. The partial least squares method was also applied to validate the model. Data were also analyzed using the MAXQDA and Smart PLS software package. Findings: In this research, from the elimination of synonym and frequently repeated factors and classification of final factors, six main factors, 24 subfactors and 24 identifiers were discovered from the texts of the relevant papers and interviews conducted with 19 experts in the area of BI and Cloud computing. The main factors of our research include drivers, enablers, competencies, critical success factors, SME characteristics and adoption. The subfactors of included competitors pressure, decision-making time, data access, data analysis and calculations, budget, clear view, clear missions, BI tools, data infrastructure, information merging, business key sector, data owner, business process, data resource, data quality, IT skill, organizational preparedness, innovation orientation, SME characteristics, SME activity, SME structure, BI maturity, standardization, agility, balances between BI systems and business strategies. Then, the quantitative part continued with the fuzzy Delphi technique in which two factors, decision-making time and agility, were deleted in the first round, and the second round was conducted for the rest of the factors. In that step, 24 factors were assessed based on the opinions of 19 experts. In the second round, none of the factors were removed, and thus the Delphi analysis was concluded. Next, data analysis was carried out by building the structural self-interaction matrix to present the model. According to the results, adoptability is a first-level or dependent variable. Regarding the results of interpretive structural modeling (ISM), the variable of critical success factors is a second-level variable. Enablers, competencies and SME characteristics are the third-level and most effective variables of the model. Accordingly, the initial model of Cloud BI for SMEs is presented as follows: The results of ISM revealed the impact of SME characteristics on BI critical success factors and adoptability. Since this category was not an underlying category of BI; thus, it played the role of a moderating variable for the impact of critical success factors on adoptability in the final model. Research limitations/implications: Since this study is limited to about 100 SMEs in the north of Iran, results should be applied cautiously to SMEs in other countries. Generalizing the study's results to other industries and geographic regions should be done with care since management perceptions, and financial condition of a business vary significantly. Additionally, the topic of business intelligence in SMEs constrained the sample from the start since not all SMEs use business intelligence systems, and others are unaware of their advantages. BI tools enable the effective management of companies of all sizes by providing analytic data and critical performance indicators. In general, SMEs used fewer business intelligence technologies than big companies. According to studies, SMEs understand the value of simplifying their information resources to make critical business choices. Additionally, they are aware of the market's abundance of business intelligence products. However, many SMEs lack the technical knowledge necessary to choose the optimal tool combination. In light of the frequently significant investment required to implement BI approaches, a viable alternative for SMEs may be to adopt cloud computing solutions that enable organizations to strengthen their systems and information technologies on a pay-per-use basis while also providing access to cutting-edge BI technologies at a reasonable price. Practical implications: Before the implementation of Cloud BI in SMEs, condition of driver, competency and critical success factor of SMEs should also be considered. These will help to define the significant resources and skills that form the strategic edge and lead to the success of Cloud BI projects. Originality/value: Most of the previous studies have been focused on factors such as critical success factors in cloud business intelligence and cloud computing in small and medium-sized enterprises, cloud business intelligence adoption models, the services used in cloud business intelligence, the factors involved in acceptance of cloud business intelligence, the challenges and advantages of cloud business intelligence, and drivers and barriers to cloud business intelligence. None of the studied resources proposed any comprehensive model for designing and implementing cloud business intelligence in small and medium-sized enterprises; they only investigated some of the aspects of this issue. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Objectives: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the level of evidence for the psychometric properties of Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) in populations with persistent pain. Materials and Methods: Five databases were searched from 1980 to December 2021. Two reviewers independently screened the titles, abstracts, and full text, extracted data, and assessed adherence to reporting standards and methodological rigor before evaluating the quality of evidence. A meta-analysis, including the pooling of correlations for the relevant EMA pain outcomes, was completed. Results: Overall, 3270 studies were identified, with 14 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses confirmed good to excellent relationships demonstrated between EMA and recalled pain intensity and interference across different timeframes. Many of the included studies did not fully adhere to recommended reporting standards, and the quality of included studies was either doubtful or inadequate due to methodological flaws. The level of evidence for measurement properties of pain outcomes was low for the criterion validity of pain intensity and interference and very low for reliability and construct validity of pain intensity and interference. Discussion: Ecological momentary assessment of pain experience appears both valid and reliable. Although the levels of evidence were low or very low, these findings provide preliminary support for the use of EMA in clinical practice and research settings. Potential strengths of EMA include providing measures with greater ecological validity while also reducing recall bias, both pertinent in pain outcome measurement. More research, including higher-quality studies, is needed to demonstrate further support for EMA, including the need for establishing other types of validity. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

"Purpose: This study aims to explore the success factors of tourism performing arts (TPA) programs by analyzing a large data set of online reviews. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 195,230 reviews from Ctrip.com were collected and preprocessed. A deep learning method was leveraged to estimate the similarity between words. Then, regression analysis was conducted to determine success factors. Findings: This study extracted four positive and two negative factors affecting tourist satisfaction with tourism performance arts. The results demonstrate that the tourists paid the most attention to the traditional Chinese cultural aspects, audiovisual effects and the actors’ performing enthusiasm. Research limitations/implications: Despite this study’s large data set, the focused was only on Chinese reviews. It would be useful and interesting to compare the success factors of tourism performance arts programs offered in different countries. Practical implications: The study findings can contribute to the development of TPA programs to attract tourists to travel destinations. Originality/value: This study demonstrates that analyzing online reviews of TPA through text mining technology is an effective method of understanding tourist satisfaction. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Based on the heuristics proposed by Helen Nissenbaum to assess ethical issues surrounding research using new technologies, this paper discusses the ethics of the collection and analysis of migrants' digital traces for academic research purposes. Concretely, this paper is grounded on an empirical research that applies a topic modeling approach to a large dataset of migrants' posts written on Facebook groups. After discussing the nine aspects proposed by Nissenbaum, the paper contends that while researchers strive to comply with ethical measures by, for instance, asking adequate questions and protecting the collected data, the lack of transparency of social networking sites is harmful to critical social sciences and can hamper findings that contribute to understanding migratory patterns and decisions.

"Migration is not an event, but an interactive process whereby individuals on the move make decisions in their social and political contexts. As such, one expects migrant mental health to change over time. To examine this relationship, we conducted a meta-analysis, the first to our knowledge, to identify the impact of migration phase and migration type on the prevalence of mental health in migrant populations. We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, and Embase for studies published between January 1, 2010, and January 1, 2020 (Prospero ID: 192751). We included studies with international migrants reporting prevalence rates for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and/or anxiety. The authors extracted data from eligible studies and tabulated mental health prevalence rates, relevant migration condition (e.g., migration type or phase), and methods (e.g., sample size). Full text review resulted in n = 269 manuscripts included in the meta-analysis examining PTSD (n = 149), depression (n = 218), and anxiety (n = 104). Overall prevalence was estimated for PTSD (30.54 %, I2 = 98.94 %, Q = 10,443.6), depression (28.57 %, I2 = 99.17 %, Q = 13,844.34), and anxiety (25.30 %, I2 = 99.2 %, Q = 10,416.20). We also estimated the effect of methodological and migration factors on prevalence in PTSD, depression, and anxiety. Our findings reveal increased prevalence of mental health due to forced migration and being in the journey phase of migration, even when accounting for the influence of methods. © 2022 Elsevier B.V."
"Importance: Patients who are immunocompromised have increased risk for morbidity and mortality associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) because they less frequently mount antibody responses to vaccines. Although neutralizing anti-spike monoclonal-antibody treatment has been widely used to treat COVID-19, evolutions of SARS-CoV-2 have been associated with monoclonal antibody-resistant SARS-CoV-2 variants and greater virulence and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, the therapeutic use of COVID-19 convalescent plasma has increased on the presumption that such plasma contains potentially therapeutic antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 that can be passively transferred to the plasma recipient. Objective: To assess the growing number of reports of clinical experiences of patients with COVID-19 who are immunocompromised and treated with specific neutralizing antibodies via COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion. Data Sources: On August 12, 2022, a systematic search was performed for clinical studies of COVID-19 convalescent plasma use in patients who are immunocompromised. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials, matched cohort studies, and case report or series on COVID-19 convalescent plasma use in patients who are immunocompromised were included. The electronic search yielded 462 unique records, of which 199 were considered for full-text screening. Data Extraction and Synthesis: The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Data were extracted by 3 independent reviewers in duplicate and pooled. Main Outcomes and Meaures: The prespecified end point was all-cause mortality after COVID-19 convalescent plasma transfusion; exploratory subgroup analyses were performed based on putative factors associated with the potential mortality benefit of convalescent plasma. Results: This systematic review and meta-analysis included 3 randomized clinical trials enrolling 1487 participants and 5 controlled studies. Additionally, 125 case series or reports enrolling 265 participants and 13 uncontrolled large case series enrolling 358 participants were included. Separate meta-analyses, using models both stratified and pooled by study type (ie, randomized clinical trials and matched cohort studies), demonstrated that transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma was associated with a decrease in mortality compared with the control cohort for the amalgam of both randomized clinical trials and matched cohort studies (risk ratio [RR], 0.63 [95% CI, 0.50-0.79]). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that transfusion of COVID-19 convalescent plasma is associated with mortality benefit for patients who are immunocompromised and have COVID-19. © 2023 American Medical Association.

"Fermion sampling is to generate probability distribution of a many-body Slater-determinant wave function, which is termed ""determinantal point process""in statistical analysis. For its inherently embedded Pauli exclusion principle, its application reaches beyond simulating fermionic quantum many-body physics to constructing machine learning models for diversified datasets. Here we propose a fermion sampling algorithm, which has a polynomial time complexity - quadratic in the fermion number and linear in the system size. This algorithm is about 100% more efficient in computation time than the best known algorithms. In sampling the corresponding marginal distribution, our algorithm has a more drastic improvement, achieving a scaling advantage. We demonstrate its power on several test applications, including sampling fermions in a many-body system and a machine learning task of text summarization, and confirm its improved computation efficiency over other methods by counting floating-point operations.  © 2023 American Physical Society."
"The mechanical study of people's opinions, sentiments, attitudes, and emotions as they are expressed through communication is known as sentiment analysis or opinion mining. This one has recently been among the most popular analytical themes in text mining and Natural Language Processing. Its widespread popularity is due to two factors: The first factor is opinions are fundamental to practically all human endeavors and are significant determinants of a person's behavior. It has a wide range of applications. Second, it resolves several challenging analysis problems that were never even attempted. We employed Big Data Framework to solve the issue because traditional solutions cannot handle the exponential growth of Amazon's food data. In this study, we investigate various approaches to sentiment analysis for large datasets of Amazon Fine Food reviews using the Apache Spark data processing engine and utilizing MLlib, the machine learning package for Apache Spark, three techniques - Linear SVC, Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes - with more than 80% accuracy rates. We find that linear SVC outperforms NB and logistic regression. Through empirical analysis, we find that sentiment analysis through a big data framework is more efficient in computation time compared to sentiment analysis without the map-reduce framework. © 2023 The authors and IOS Press."
"Introduction: Currently, young people have access to a large amount of information, so they must have the ability to critically analyze the texts they are exposed to in order to choose those that are useful for their training or research process, as well as to have the necessary skills to interact efficiently with the texts, especially with those specialized documents corresponding to their area of study. In this regard, this article aims to identify how cognitive, emotional, attitudinal, digital and personality aspects influence the development of academic literacy skills in university students. Method: Research was conducted with the mixed method, in which quantitative instruments were applied and analyzed: a Likert scale questionnaire to measure the perceived level of mastery of academic literacy skills, which was applied to a sample of 595 students from higher education institutions in Mexico and Spain. In addition, a test was applied to identify personality type. For the qualitative part, the case study was chosen and the qualitative instruments applied were interviews with a teacher and a student and a focus group with five students. Results: The findings identified were as follows: (a) the cognitive aspect of academic literacy is the one with the lowest perceived mastery by students, (b) having a positive attitude favors the development of academic literacy, (c) by knowing the aspects of their personality that can favor the development of academic literacy, students can seek strategies to improve that competency, (d) the emotional part has repercussions in the process of developing the competence of academic literacy, (e) students prefer to interact with texts in digital spaces and therefore must learn to interact critically in virtual environments, (f) Mexican students perceive themselves to have a higher level of mastery of the academic literacy competency than Spanish students. Conclusion: The literature review and the mixed methods study allowed identifying the relevance of approaching academic literacy in university environments in a holistic manner through the analysis of the influence of cognitive, attitudinal, emotional, digital and personality aspects.

"This book uncovers cultural traces of the ancient Jewry of Eastern Europe from the 10th to 15th centuries. These traces take the form of translations from Hebrew into East Slavic, ranging from accounts of Old Testament prophets and other historical figures of interest to both Jews and Christians, such as Alexander the Great, to scientific and philosophical texts on everything from astronomy to physiognomy to metaphysics. Moshe Taube's fine-grained analysis teases out a robust picture of this massive cultural enterprise: the translators, their erudition, their biases, and their collaborative method of translation with neighboring Christians. Summarizing over thirty years of philological and linguistic research, this book offers a substantial original contribution to the cultural history of Jews in Eastern Europe and their interaction with, and influence on, Slavic culture in the Middle Ages and Early Modern period. © 2023 by Moshe Taube.

"The paper is aimed at a critical review of the literature dealing with text mining and sentiment analysis for stock market prediction. The aim of this work is to create a critical review of the literature, especially with regard to the latest findings of research articles in the selected topic strictly focused on stock markets represented by stock indices or stock titles. This requires examin-ing and critically analyzing the methods used in the analysis of sentiment from textual data, with special regard to the possibility of generalization and transferability of research results. For this reason, an analytical approach is also used in working with the literature and a critical approach in its organization, especially for completeness, coherence, and consistency. Based on the selected criteria, 260 articles corresponding to the subject area are selected from the world databases of Web of Science and Scopus. These studies are graphically captured through bibliometric analysis. Subsequently, the selection of articles was narrowed to 49. The outputs are synthesized and the main findings and limits of the current state of research are highlighted with possible future directions of subsequent research. © 2023 The Author(s).

"BACKGROUND: Oncologists are often concerned that talking about death with patients may hinder their relationship. However, the views of death held by patients have not been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to describe the perception of death among patients with advanced cancer receiving early palliative care (EPC) and their caregivers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed on 2 databases: (a) transcripts of open-ended questionnaires administered to 130 cancer patients receiving EPC with a mean age of 68.4 years and to 115 primary caregivers of patients on EPC with a mean age of 56.8; (b) texts collected from an Italian forum, containing instances of web-mediated interactions between patients and their caregivers. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis shows that: (a) patients and caregivers are not afraid of speaking about death; (b) patients and caregivers on EPC use the word ""death"" significantly more than patients on standard oncology care (SOC) and their caregivers (P < .0001). For both participants on EPC and SOC, the adjectives and verbs associated with the word ""death"" have positive connotations; however, these associations are significantly more frequent for participants on EPC (verbs, Ps < .0001; adjectives, Ps < .003). Qualitative analysis reveals that these positive connotations refer to an actual, positive experience of the end of life in the EPC group and a wish or a negated event in the SOC group. CONCLUSIONS: EPC interventions, along with proper physician-patient communication, may be associated with an increased acceptance of death in patients with advanced cancer and their caregivers. © The Author(s) 2022.

"Background: The substantial increasing trend of binge drinking is a global alarm. Our aim was to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies to explore the association of current smoking with binge drinking among adults. Methods: We systematically searched Web of Knowledge; PubMed; Scopus; Embase and Ovid (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, PsycEXTRA, and PsycTests) (from inception to 27 May 2020) databases to identify cross-sectional studies of the association between current smoking and binge drinking. Study screening, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment were all carried out by two independent authors. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) was pooled with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random effects model in the meta-analysis, followed by the investigation of the heterogeneity via Q-test and I2 statistic. We assessed publication bias using a funnel plot, the Egger’s, and Begg’s tests. Results: We identified 3,171 studies and included nine cross-sectional studies with 64,516 participants. A significant association was found between current smoking and binge drinking among both genders (AOR = 2.97; 95% CI = 1.98 to 4.45; I2 = 90.5%). Subgroup analysis showed that this association among women, men, Caucasians, and Asians/Africans were (AOR = 3.68; 95% CI = 1.03 to 13.18; I2 = 98.9%), (AOR = 2.53; 95% CI = 1.87 to 3.42; I2 = 73.1%), (AOR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.01–1.83, I2 = 47.4%), and (AOR = 3.93; 95% CI: 2.99–5.17, I2 = 61.3%), respectively. There was no evidence of publication bias. Conclusion: Current smoking is associated with binge drinking and can be used for identifying and screening binge drinkers. Moreover, this association is stronger among men, and Asians/Africans. This meta-analysis estimation was limited to English-language studies, and the full text of about 3.5% of reports for retrieval was not found, then generalization of the results should be done with caution.

"Accurate forecasting of social power demand is the country's primary task in making decisions on power overall planning, coal power withdrawal, and renewable energy investment. The integration of text data based and traditional time series data may improve the power demand forecasting ability. Therefore, based on the idea of multimodal information fusion, we construct a novel comprehensive power demand prediction model CNN-LSTM (Convolution Neural Network, Long Short-term Memory) in a multi-heterogeneous data environment. Empirical results show that the proposed prediction model is effective, and it proves that the organic fusion of time series data and text data can effectively improve forecasting performance. And China's power demand growth will gradually slow down or even show a downward trend in the next two years, which provides an important decision-making reference for the low-carbon transformation of China's power system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
"The design of complex engineering systems is an often long and articulated process that highly relies on engineers’ expertise and professional judgment. As such, the typical pitfalls of activities involving the human factor often manifest themselves in terms of lack of completeness or exhaustiveness of the analysis, inconsistencies across design choices or documentation, as well as an implicit degree of subjectivity. An approach is proposed to assist systems engineers in the automatic generation of systems diagrams from unstructured natural language text. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques are used to extract entities and their relationships from textual resources (e.g., specifications, manuals, technical reports, maintenance reports) available within an organisation, and convert them into Systems Modelling Language (SysML) diagrams, with particular focus on structure and requirement diagrams. The intention is to provide the users with a more standardised, comprehensive and automated starting point onto which subsequently refine and adapt the diagrams according to their needs. The proposed approach is flexible and open-domain. It consists of six steps which leverage open-access tools, and it leads to an automatic generation of SysML diagrams without intermediate modelling requirement, but through the specification of a set of parameters by the user. The applicability and benefits of the proposed approach are shown through six case studies having different textual sources as inputs, and benchmarked against manually defined diagram elements. © 2022 The Author(s)"
"Introduction: The impact of COVID-19 social restrictions on mental wellbeing of health professional students during placement is largely unknown. Conventional survey methods do not capture emotional fluctuations. Increasing use of smartphones suggests short message service (SMS) functionality could provide easy, rapid data. This project tested the feasibility and validity of gathering data on Therapeutic Radiography student mental wellbeing during clinical placement via emoji and SMS. Methods: Participants provided anonymous daily emoji responses via WhatsApp to a dedicated mobile phone. Additional weekly prompts sought textual responses indicating factors impacting on wellbeing. A short anonymous online survey validated responses and provided feedback on the method. Results: Participants (n = 15) provided 254 daily responses using 108 different emoji; these triangulated with weekly textual responses. Feedback concerning the method was positive. 'Happy' emoji were used most frequently; social interaction and fatigue were important wellbeing factors. Anonymity and opportunity to feedback via SMS were received positively; ease and rapidity of response engendered engagement throughout the 3-week study. Conclusions: The use of emoji for rapid assessment of cohort mental wellbeing is valid and potentially useful alongside more formal evaluation and support strategies. Capturing simple wellbeing responses from a cohort may facilitate the organisation of timely support interventions.  © The Author(s), 2022. Published by Cambridge University Press."
"In this study, ""Stallion wrestling,"" which was made in the nature of horse¬herds (yilki) and a designated area for horse breeding in ancient Turks, is presented with some arguments. Explaining briefly the importance given to horses and horse breeders in ancient Turks and today's Central Asian culture, how stallion wrestling was formed and transformed; it was aimed to seek answers to the questions of why horse breeding was not done with this wrestling method in the Ottoman Empire, but it was done with a canter running system and to recognize and introduce this ancient traditional struggle. In this study, which was carried out with the descriptive definition method, which is among the qualitative study patterns, document/text analysis was also carried out. It has been understood that almost all of the ancient Turkish-Mongolian peoples, except for the archaeological findings in the museums of Southern Siberia, the petroglyphs in the same geography and Central Asia, and the Anatolian Balkans, practiced stallion wrestling for breeding purposes, at least until the last quarter of the 20th century. Today, the wrestling struggles of the stallions continue in the Central Asian geography for the leadership of the semi-wild snakes released into nature; the Turkish tribes of the Altai Republic, who were victorious and took their stallions, made stallion wrestling once a year in the third week of July in the ""Folk- Game/El-Oyun"" festival. However, it was removed from the 2022 program because it was seen as contrary to animal rights by those who came to this festival. But wrestling continues in the rural areas of the Altai Turkic peoples and all-over Inner Mongolia. The 'horse races' for horse breeding in the Ottoman Empire intensified in the second half of the 19th century, and it was understood that they were not held for breeding purposes after 1920. © 2023 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

"A growing body of evidence suggests that news media which includes a sympathetic portrayal of a mother bereaved by substance use can increase public support for harm reduction initiatives. However, the extent to which such news media coverage occurs in Canada is unknown, and research has not documented how the news media in Canada covers such stories. We undertook a mixed-method secondary analyses of 5681 Canadian newspaper articles on harm reduction (2000-2016). Quantitative analyses described the volume and content of harm reduction reporting featuring a mother whose child's death was related to substance use while qualitative thematic analysis provided in-depth descriptions of the discourses underlying such news reporting. Newspaper articles featuring a mother whose child's death was related to substance use were rarely published (n = 63; 1.1% of total harm reduction media coverage during the study period). Deductive content analysis of these 63 texts revealed that coverage of naloxone distribution (42.9%) and supervised drug consumption services (28.6%) were prioritized over other harm reduction services. Although harm reduction (services or policies) were advocated by the mother in most (77.8%) of these 63 texts, inductive thematic analysis of a subset (n = 52) of those articles revealed that mothers' advocacy was diminished by newspaper reporting that emphasized their experiences of grief, prioritized individual biographies over structural factors contributing to substance use harms, and created rhetorical divisions between different groups of people who use drugs (PWUD). Bereaved mothers' advocacy in support of harm reduction programs and services may be minimized in the process of reporting their stories for newspaper readers. Finding ways to report bereaved mothers' stories in ways that are inclusive of all PWUD while highlighting the role of broad, structural determinants of substance use has the potential to shift public opinion and government support in favour of these life-saving services.

"The development of effective vaccines in <1 year to combat the spread of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is an example of particularly rapid progress in biomedicine. However, this was only made possible by decades of investment in scientific research. Many important research commentaries and reviews have been provided to describe the various contributions and scientific breakthroughs that led to the development of COVID-19 vaccines. In this work, we sought to complement those efforts by adding a systematic and quantitative study of the research foundations that led to these vaccines. Here, we analyzed citations from COVID-19 vaccine research articles to determine which scientific areas of study contributed the most to this research. Our findings revealed that coronavirus research was cited most often, and by a large margin. However, significant contributions were also seen from a diverse set of fields such as cancer, diabetes, and HIV/AIDS. In addition, we examined the publication history of the most prolific authors of COVID-19 vaccine research to determine their research expertise prior to the pandemic. Interestingly, although COVID-19 vaccine research relied most heavily on previous coronavirus work, we find that the most prolific authors on these publications most often had expertise in other areas including influenza, cancer, and HIV/AIDS. Finally, we used machine learning to identify and group together publications based on their major topic areas. This allowed us to elucidate the differences in citations between research areas. These findings highlight and quantify the relevance of prior research from a variety of scientific fields to the rapid development of a COVID-19 vaccine. This study also illustrates the importance of funding and sustaining a diverse research enterprise to facilitate a rapid response to future pandemics.

"We study the nonlinear localized modes in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates with parity-time-symmetric Scarf-II potential, which can be described by the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Firstly, we investigate the linear stability of the nonlinear modes in the focusing and defocusing cases, and get the stable and unstable domains of nonlinear localized modes. Then we validate the results by evolving them with 5% perturbations as an initial condition. Finally, we get stable solitons by considering excitations of the soliton via adiabatical change of system parameters. These findings of nonlinear modes can be potentially applied to physical experiments of matter waves in Bose-Einstein condensates. Copyright: © 2023 Zhang, Wang.

"Purpose: When service failure occurs, it leads to dissatisfaction, lack of trust and avoidance behaviour among customers, and it can also be seen as a threat to the survival of the business. This paper aims to investigate the current and potential dynamics of service failure research within the tourism and hospitality area. Design/methodology/approach: By adopting qualitative, quantitative (citation and text mining) and science-mapping tools (descriptive, conceptual and intellectual), this study analyses 99 key papers on service failure in 18 major hospitality and tourism journals over a 20-year span. Findings: The research on service recovery strategies, recovery efforts, pre- and post-failure and post-recovery in the service encounter and the impacts of justice on post-recovery and post-complaint behaviour are identified as the major streams of service failure research. While emotional labour, rumination and satisfaction recovery were identified as emerging themes, service failure perceptions and social media were found as the developed and substantial trends. Practical implications: This study presents a comprehensive understanding of service failure research development in the hospitality and tourism industry. This study propose three areas – circumstantial cues, interactional cues and crisis management – that practitioners need to understand to minimise service failure during the service interaction. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, no prior bibliometric study has investigated the current and future dynamics of service failure in the hospitality and tourism industry and offered a research agenda based on this gap in the literature. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"This study surveyed 445 primary, secondary, and higher education teachers to understand their usage of AI tools in the classroom. Results revealed that while teachers generally have a positive attitude toward AI in education, only 25% of them have actually incorporated AI-based tools into their teaching. Moreover, the most common used tools were ChatGPT, Dall-E, and Midjourney. Finally, primary and secondary school teachers mainly use AI for content creation purposes such as presentations, texts, or videos, without emphasizing student engagement with AI tools. In contrast, higher education teachers utilize AI for academic-technical purposes, explaining AI functioning, obtaining information, and enabling students to experiment with AI tools, as well as research-related tasks like text translation, or data analysis. Based on these results, AI training programs for educators should be tailored to each stage, incorporating a wider variety of AI tools beyond the commonly used ones like ChatGPT. © 2023 ISTE."
"Late elementary education constitutes a critical period in the development of reading comprehension strategies, a key competence in today’s society. However, to date, appropriate measurements to map late elementary students’ reading strategies are lacking. In this respect, the present article first describes the development and validation of the 26-item reading comprehension strategies questionnaire (RCSQ). To this aim, exploratory (sample 1: n = 1585 students) and confirmatory (sample 2: n = 1585 students) factor analyses were conducted. These analyses resulted in the RCSQ, consisting of five subscales: (1) overt cognitive reading strategies, (2) covert cognitive reading strategies, (3) monitoring, and (4) evaluating. For non-native and bilingual students, a fifth subscale ‘using home language in view of comprehending texts’ emerged. Second, multilevel analyses were performed to explore individual differences in late elementary students’ reading comprehension strategy use. Implications for practice and future research are discussed. Copyright © 2023 Bogaert, Merchie, Rosseel and Van Keer."
"Purpose: With an explosion of datasets available on the Web, dataset search has gained attention as an emerging research domain. Understanding users' dataset behaviour is imperative for providing effective data discovery services. In this paper, the authors present a study on users' dataset search behaviour through the analysis of search logs from a research data discovery portal. Design/methodology/approach: Using query and session based features, the authors apply cluster analysis to discover distinct user profiles with different search behaviours. One particular behavioural construct of our interest is users' expertise that the authors generate via computing semantic similarity between users' search queries and the title of metadata records in the displayed search results. Findings: The findings revealed that there are six distinct classes of user behaviours for dataset search, namely; Expert Research, Expert Search, Expert Explore, Novice Research, Novice Search and Novice Explore. Research limitations/implications: The user profiles are derived based on analysis of the search log of the research data catalogue in this study. Further research is needed to generalise the user profiles to other dataset search settings. Future research can take on a confirmatory approach to verify these user groups and establish a deeper understanding of their information needs. Practical implications: The findings in this paper have implications for designing search systems that tailor search results matching the diverse information needs of different user groups. Originality/value: We propose for the first time a taxonomy of users for dataset search based on their domain expertise and search behaviour. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."

"Multimodal sentiment analysis has attracted increasing attention with broad application prospects. Most of the existing methods have focused on a single modality, which fails to handle social media data due to its multiple modalities. Moreover, in multimodal learning, most of the works have focused on simply combining the two modalities without exploring the complicated correlations between them. This resulted in dissatisfying performance for multimodal sentiment classification. Motivated by the status quo, we propose a Deep Multi-level Attentive network (DMLANet), which exploits the correlation between image and text modalities to improve multimodal learning. Specifically, we generate the bi-attentive visual map along the spatial and channel dimensions to magnify Convolutional neural network representation power. Then, we model the correlation between the image regions and semantics of the word by extracting the textual features related to the bi-attentive visual features by applying semantic attention. Finally, self-attention is employed to fetch the sentiment-rich multimodal features for the classification automatically. We conduct extensive evaluations on four real-world datasets, namely, MVSA-Single, MVSA-Multiple, Flickr, and Getty Images, which verify our method's superiority. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery."
"Purpose: Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) has attracted much attention from both methodological and applied researchers in various disciplines – also in hospitality management research. As PLS-SEM is relatively new compared to other multivariate analysis techniques, there are still numerous open questions and uncertainties in its application. This study aims to address this important issue by offering guidance regarding its use in contexts with which researchers struggle. Design/methodology/approach: The authors examine the most prominent questions and answers posed in a well-known PLS-SEM discussion forum. The authors do so by using a text analysis technique to identify the most salient topics. Findings: The data analysis identifies three salient PLS-SEM topics (i.e. bootstrapping and significance testing, higher-order constructs and moderation). Research limitations/implications: The results allow us to address the PLS-SEM community’s main methodological issues. The authors discuss each area separately and provide explanations and guidelines. Practical implications: The guidelines on the most important PLS-SEM topics provide decision-making and application aids. In this way, the authors make a decisive contribution to clarifying ambiguities when applying the PLS-SEM method in hospitality management research and other disciplines. Originality/value: There has as yet been no systematic analysis of this kind in the field of PLS-SEM; the authors, therefore, present the first research results. The findings and recommendations provide guidance for PLS-SEM applications in hospitality research and practice. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The possibility of predicting anticipated scores representing student's characteristics from their essay texts using a machine learning technique was examined. Student's characteristics include critical thinking disposition ability, disaster-prevention conscientiousness, and personality. First, the potential for predicting essay assessment scores from essay texts using machine learning with each set of essay reports or essay comments was confirmed. However, prediction performance of one other set of essays and other scores of student's characteristics was insufficient.

"Purpose: This study aims to unveil within the current academic literature the principal directions in the ethnic entrepreneurship and small business marketing research context. Design/methodology/approach: An automated literature analysis procedure was undertaken, attempting to cover all literature published on the subject since 1962. A total of 188 articles were analysed using text mining and topic modelling. Findings: The results show a lack of framing of ethnic entrepreneurship literature outside the narrower scope of migration. Some core themes were found (e.g. network, diversity) around which several other themes orbit, including both related issues to the ethnic factor (e.g. barriers and minorities) and managerial issues (e.g. marketing and production). Originality/value: Ethnic minority business and small business marketing research has seen a growing number of publications. However, a careful review of existing work is missing. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Communication is critical for nonprofit fundraising activity because it fosters trust and accountability as well as enhances mutual understanding of the nonprofit’s mission and objectives. Nonprofit organizations develop their own strategies based on who they communicate with and utilize a variety of content through various channels and media. Although it is critical for nonprofits to use their funds efficiently for communication and fundraising, they must also consider ethical concerns. Utilizing a text network analysis and narrative review, we find that although research on fundraising communication has been increasing in the past years, ethical fundraising communication has been rarely studied. Furthermore, beneficiaries and fundraisers have been far less studied compared to donors. The results also show that the emergence of new media such as social media was the main driver of diversifying research in recent years. Our findings suggest that nonprofits are ethically and equally accountable to both givers (donors and funders) and receivers (beneficiaries and recipients). Especially, it is critical being cautious when dealing with socially vulnerable populations such as the elderly, patients, and those in need. This study provides directions for future research and practical implications. © 2023 American Society for Public Administration."
"This article explores the link between creativity and artificial intelligence in the cultural landscape of collaborative productions between human and artificial authors. It proposes a re-signifying exploration of the term creativity and its peculiarities within the proliferation of digital culture, drawing from Kenneth Goldsmith's concept of “uncreative writing” (2015). From this perspective, the text Los Campos Electromagnéticos by Jorge Carrión (2023), co-created with Taller Estampa and GPT-2 and 3, is examined. In the analysis, we propose a reassessment of the creative act as an exclusively anthropocentric structure, and the errors, hallucinations, fictions, and mirrors generated by artificial intelligence writing are valued as an algorithmic form of textual reimagination. © 2023 Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata.

"Purpose: This study aims to develop a hierarchical topic analysis tool (HTAT) based on hierarchical Latent Dirichelet allocation (hLDA) to support digital humanities research that is associated with the need of topic exploration on the Digital Humanities Platform for Mr. Lo Chia-Lun’s Writings (DHP-LCLW). HTAT can assist humanities scholars on distant reading with analysis of hierarchical text topics, through classifying time-stamped texts into multiple historical eras, conducting hierarchical topic modeling (HTM) according to the texts from different eras and presenting through visualization. The comparative network diagram is another function provided to assist humanities scholars in comparing the difference in the topics they wish to explore and to track how the concept of a topic changes over time from a particular perspective. In addition, HTAT can also provide humanities scholars with the feature to view source texts, thus having high potential to be applied in promoting the effectiveness of topic exploration due to simultaneously integrating both the topic exploration functions of distant reading and close reading. Design/methodology/approach: This study adopts a counterbalanced experimental design to examine whether there is significant differences in the effectiveness of topic inquiry, the number of relevant topics inquired and the time spent on them when research participants were alternately conducting text exploration using DHP-LCLW with HTAT or DHP-LCLW with Single-layer Topic Analysis Tool (SLTAT). A technology acceptance questionnaire and semi-structured interviews were also conducted to understand the research participants' perception and feelings toward using the two different tools to assist topic inquiry. Findings: The experimental results show that DHP-LCLW with HTAT could better assist the research participants, in comparison with DHP-LCLW with SLTAT, to grasp the topic context of the texts from two particular perspectives assigned by this study within a short period. In addition, the results of the interviews revealed that DHP-LCLW with HTAT, in comparison with SLTAT, was able to provide a topic terms that better met research participnats' expectations and needs, and effectively guided them to the corresponding texts for close reading. In the analysis of technology acceptance and interview data, it can be found that the research participants have a high and positive tendency toward using DHP-LCLW with HTAT to assist topic inquiry. Research limitations/implications: The Jieba Chinese word segmentation system was used in the Mr. Lo Chia-Lun’s Writings Database in this study, to perform word segmentation on Mr. Lo Chia-Lun’s writing texts for topic modeling based on hLDA. Since Jieba word segmentation system is a lexicon based word segmentation system, it cannot identify new words that have still not been collected in the lexicon well. In this case, the correctness of word segmentation on the target texts will affect the results of hLDA topic modeling, and the effectiveness of HTAT in assisting humanities scholars for topic inquiry. Practical implications: An HTAT was developed to support digital humanities research in this study. With HTAT, DHP-LCLW provides hmanities scholars with topic clues from different hierarchical perspectives for textual exploration, and with temporal and comparative network diagrams to assist humanities scholars in tracking the evolution of the topics of specific perspectives over time, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the overall context of the texts. Originality/value: In recent years, topic analysis technology that can automatically extract key topic information from a large amount of texts has been developed rapidly, but the topics generated from traditional topic analysis models like LDA (Latent Dirichelet allocation) make it difficult for users to understand the differences in the topics of texts with different hierarchical levels. Thus, this study proposes HTAT which uses hLDA to build a hierarchical topic tree with a tree-like structure without the need to define the number of topics in advance, enabling humanities scholars to quickly grasp the concept of textual topics and use different hierarchical perspectives for further textual exploration. At the same time, it also provides a combination function of temporal division and comparative network diagram to assist humanities scholars in exploring topics and their changes in different eras, which helps them discover more useful research clues or findings. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Introduction: Humans spend most of their time in settlements, and the built environment of settlements may affect the residents' sentiments. Research in this field is interdisciplinary, integrating urban planning and public health. However, it has been limited by the difficulty of quantifying subjective sentiments and the small sample size. Methods: This study uses 147,613 Weibo text check-ins in Xiamen from 2017 to quantify residents' sentiments in 1,096 neighborhoods in the city. A multilevel regression model and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model are used to investigate the multilevel and nonlinear effects of the built environment of neighborhoods and subdistricts on residents' sentiments. Results: The results show the following: (1) The multilevel regression model indicates that at the neighborhood level, a high land value, low plot ratio, low population density, and neighborhoods close to water are more likely to improve the residents' sentiments. At the subdistrict level, more green space and commercial land, less industry, higher building density and road density, and a smaller migrant population are more likely to promote positive sentiments. Approximately 19% of the total variance in the sentiments occurred among subdistricts. (2) The proportion of green space and commercial land, and the density of buildings and roads are linearly correlated with residents' sentiments. The land value is a basic need and exhibits a nonlinear correlation with sentiments. The plot ratio, population density, and the proportions of industrial land and the migrant population are advanced needs and are nonlinearly correlated with sentiments. Discussion: The quantitative analysis of sentiments enables setting a threshold of the influence of the built environment on residents' sentiments in neighborhoods and surrounding areas. Our results provide data support for urban planning and implementing targeted measures to improve the living environment of residents.

"Objectives: The study aimed to conduct a bibliometric analysis of publications concerning lumbar spondylolisthesis, as well as summarize its research topics and hotspot trends with machine-learning based text mining. Methods: The data were extracted from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC) database and then analyzed in Rstudio1.3.1 and CiteSpace5.8. Annual publication production and the top-20 productive authors over time were obtained. Additionally, top-20 productive journals and top-20 influential journals were compared by spine-subspecialty or not. Similarly, top-20 productive countries/regions and top-20 influential countries/regions were compared by they were developed countries/regions or not. The collaborative relationship among countries and institutions were presented. The main topics of lumbar spondylolisthesis were classified by Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) analysis, and the hotspot trends were indicated by keywords with strongest citation bursts. Results: Up to 2021, a total number of 4,245 articles concerning lumbar spondylolisthesis were finally included for bibliometric analysis. Spine-subspecialty journals were found to be dominant in the productivity and the impact of the field, and SPINE, EUROPEAN SPINE JOURNAL and JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY-SPINE were the top-3 productive and the top-3 influential journals in this field. USA, Japan and China have contributed to over half of the publication productivity, but European countries seemed to publish more influential articles. It seemed that developed countries/regions tended to produce more articles and more influential articles, and international collaborations mainly occurred among USA, Europe and eastern Asia. Publications concerning surgical management was the major topic, followed by radiographic assessment and epidemiology for this field. Surgical management especially minimally invasive technique for lumbar spondylolisthesis were the recent hotspots over the past 5 years. Conclusions: The study successfully summarized the productivity and impact of different entities, which should benefit the journal selection and pursuit of international collaboration for researcher who were interested in the field of lumbar spondylolisthesis. Additionally, the current study may encourage more researchers joining in the field and somewhat inform their research direction in the future. 2023 Fan, Li, Yang, Qin, Huang, Liu, He and Liao."

"Objective: Emergency medical (EM) response systems require extensive coordination, particularly during mass casualty incidents (MCIs). The recognition of preparedness gaps and contextual priorities to MCI response capacity in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) can be better understood through the components of EM reponse systems. This study aims to delineate essential components and provide a framework for effective emergency medical response to MCIs. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using 4 databases. Title and abstract screening was followed by full-text review. Thematic analysis was conducted to identify themes pertaining to the essential components and integration of EM response systems. Results: Of 20,456 screened citations, 181 articles were included in the analysis. Seven major and 40 sub-themes emerged from the content analysis as the essential components and supportive elements of MCI medical response. The essential components of MCI response were integrated into a framework demonstrating interrelated connections between essential and supportive elements. Conclusions: Definitions of essential components of EM response to MCIs vary considerably. Most literature pertaining to MCI response originates from high income countries with far fewer reports from LMICs. Integration of essential components is needed in different geopolitical and economic contexts to ensure an effective MCI emergency medical response.  © The Author(s), 2022.

"Objective: In the context of the development of information metric studies, this article proposes and applies a method for obtaining thematic indicators on descriptors representative of themes, subjects or keywords addressed in bibliographic records in the Information Science area. Method: A methodological research of applied nature was carried out, using technical procedures of automatic indexing and information metric studies. Initially, a corpus was delimited contemplating a set of bibliographic records referring to 60 articles of Brazilian journals. Later, the software Maui was applied as an automatic indexing system for categorizing the keywords of the bibliographic records into concepts of a specialty thesaurus, contemplating descriptors in the language of the metadata text. Next, the Iramuteq software was applied to generate the thematic indicators from the descriptors obtained by the automatic indexing. Finally, the proposed method was validated based on the analysis of the results obtained for the corpus. Result: The flowcharts for validation of automatic indexing and for validation of the information metric study are described, aiming to explain the processes of the proposed method as steps in processing the corpus. In addition, quality metrics for automatic indexing are presented, as well as statistical analyses of word frequency and co-occurrence, and term frequency, where the corpus' main thematic indicators are pointed out. Conclusions: We conclude that the thematic indicators obtained by applying the proposed method represent the main themes identified in the corpus, and that the method can be applied to obtain thematic indicators for other sets of bibliographic records. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

"Purpose: Since 2018, there has been a resurgence in initial public offering (IPO) pricing studies. The authors aim to consolidate the knowledge and explore current dynamics, understand knowledge progression, elicit trends, and provide future research directions for IPO pricing research. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted a two-stage hybrid review based on 512 high-quality Scopus articles on IPO pricing published over the last decade. The authors deploy bibliometric analysis, and then, based on 61 curated articles, the authors conduct content analysis and offer future research directions. Findings: Four key research streams emerged: information asymmetry, agency problems, legal, regulatory, and social environment, and behavioral finance. Future research may focus on behavioral explanations for IPO underpricing, the role of investor sentiment in IPO pricing, text analytics, machine learning, and big data in alleviating information asymmetry and agency problems. The authors summarize and present content analysis using the classic Theory, Context, Characteristics, Methods (TCCM) framework. Research limitations/implications: Using different databases, bibliometric analysis tools, sample period or article screening criteria for the study might give different results. However, the study's major findings are robust to alternative choices. Practical implications: This study serves as a ready reckoner for the research scholars, practitioners, regulators, policymakers, and investors interested in understanding the nuances of IPO pricing. Originality/value: The study sheds light on the most influential documents, authors, and journals, offers an understanding of knowledge structure, identifies and discusses primary research streams and related implications, and provides future research directions. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Purpose: This article develops a methodological framework to support qualitative analyses of legal texts. Scholars across the social sciences and humanities use qualitative methods to study legal phenomena but often overlook formal legal texts as productive sites for analysis. Moreover, when qualitative researchers do analyze legal texts, they rarely discuss the methodological underpinnings that support their approach. A thorough consideration of the methodological underpinnings of qualitative approaches to legal analysis is therefore warranted. Design/methodology/approach: By bringing critical legal theory into conversation with qualitative methodology, this article outlines a set of key principles to inform qualitative approaches to reading the law. Findings: To construct this methodological framework, this article first distinguishes between qualitative approaches to textual analysis and the doctrinal approaches undertaken in legal practice and formal legal scholarship. It then considers how this qualitative approach might be applied to one particular genre of legal text: namely, judicial opinions, otherwise known as reasons for judgment. In doing so, it argues that robust qualitative analyses of legal texts must consider the unique characteristics of those texts, such as their distinct form, voice, rhetorical structure, and performative capabilities. Originality/value: The methodological framework outlined here should encourage qualitative researchers to approach legal texts more readily and challenge the hegemony of doctrinal approaches to legal interpretation in social science research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"With the development of technology, voice sentiment analysis has also undergone rapid development, and its application fields are constantly expanding. Multimodal models have become a key focus of researchers due to their ability to better predict emotions. In order to help English learners improve their oral English proficiency, a deep learning based emotional analysis model for English short text reading is proposed, and this model is used to analyze emotions in English reading. Additionally, a cross-modal attention mechanism based on a prediction-assisted task was developed to identify emotions in English reading aloud in state and a two-layer attention-based bi-directional long- and short-term memory network was created to classify emotions in English reading aloud. The results of the research revealed that the classification model’s mean F1 value was 98.54%, the detection model’s mean F1 value was 85.13%, and the speech emotion analysis model’s mean F1 value was 73.55, which was not significantly different from the mean of the professionals’ ratings. The significance of the study lies in providing English learners with a method and pathway to improve their oral English proficiency. © 2023 SCPE. All Rights Reserved."
"Public attitudes and intentions are crucial for successful technological innovation, such as automated vehicles (AVs). To effectively advance the development and future evolution of AVs, it is crucial to comprehensively understand individuals’ perceptions of autonomous driving. However, traditional survey methods using structured questionnaires may limit respondents’ ability to express themselves freely. To address this limitation, we employ Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze consumers’ opinions and attitudes towards AVs as shared on social media platforms. Through Python programming, we collected and analyzed consumer comments from leading Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo, TikTok) and automotive social media platforms (Autohome Inc.) between June 2020 and April 2023, totaling 120,486 comments. Leveraging advanced text mining techniques such as Dynamic topic models (DTM), sentiment analysis, and semantic network analysis based on Pointwise mutual information (PMI) algorithms, we investigate the evolution of public perception regarding AVs over the past three years. Our findings unveil a predominant negative sentiment towards AVs, with discernible shifts in sentiment coinciding with major AV-related social events. Furthermore, we explore the reasons behind users’ negative attitudes and identify potential factors contributing to the distrust of autonomous driving. These findings provide valuable guidance to public agencies, automobile manufacturers, and technology companies, enhancing their understanding of the adoption of AVs. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Public perception and opinion have an important influence on tackling carbon emission and climate. Since the introduction of the carbon neutrality target in China, there has been widespread debate and action by various stakeholders. Weibo is an effective tool for gaining a timely and comprehensive understanding of public acceptance of carbon neutrality policy in China. Based on text data crawled on the Weibo platform, this paper combines improved sentiment analysis and network analysis methods to innovatively propose a multidimensional feature research framework that integrates time, space, sentiment, behavior and content to explore the single and multiple types of interactive behaviors, fine-grained emotions and differences in opinions of different types of users on the national policy of carbon neutrality target. The results show that the rise in popularity of carbon neutrality is related to the occurrence of important carbon events, and the public in economically developed regions such as Beijing and Shanghai are more concerned about carbon neutrality. Positive public sentiment towards carbon neutrality dominates, with the proportion of neutral sentiment increasing when major carbon events occur. Governments and celebrities are more influential than other types of users, and the core content of public concern is consistent, with marginal content varying by identity. This study provides a comprehensive analysis and support for the effective implementation of carbon neutrality related policies as well as the improvement of public awareness and acceptance. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"A central part of singing includes learning new pieces of vocal music. Learning a new song is a complex task that involves several functions and modalities, such as memory functions, language and motor skills, and auditory and visual perception. Memory functions are a well-studied area, but it is unknown how memory theories apply to a multimodal activity such as singing. In this study, an attempt is made to translate the theories to the applied field of singing. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of three types of learning formats for learning new song lyrics: auditory learning with image support (AI), auditory learning with text support (AT), and auditory learning only (A). Ninety-five participants were randomly assigned to one of the three experimental conditions. A univariate analysis of variance revealed a significant effect of condition on the lyric recall score and post-hoc tests showed that participants performed significantly better in the AI condition in comparison to both the AT and the A condition. No significant difference was found between AT and A. This study sheds light on how memory processes might work in learning song lyrics. Practical implications for practitioners such as music educators, conductors, and choir singers are discussed. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Nineteenth-century European representations of Africa are notorious for depicting the continent with a blank interior. But there was a time when British writers filled Africa with landed empires and contiguous trade routes linked together by a network of rivers. This geographical narrative proliferated in fictional and nonfictional texts alike, and it was born not from fanciful speculation but from British interpretations of what Africans said and showed about themselves and their worlds. Investigations of the representation of Africa in British texts have typically concluded that the continent operated in the British imagination as a completely invented space with no meaningful connection to actual African worlds, or as an inert realm onto which writers projected their expansionist fantasies. With African Impressions, Rebekah Mitsein revises that narrative, demonstrating that African elites successfully projected expressions of their sovereignty, wealth, right to power, geopolitical clout, and religious exceptionalism into Europe long before Europeans entered sub-Saharan Africa. Mitsein considers the ways that African self-representation continued to drive European impressions of the continent across the early Enlightenment, fueling desires to find the sources of West Africa's gold and the city states along the Niger, to establish a relationship with the Christian kingdom of Prester John, and to discover the source of the Nile. Through an analysis of a range of genres, including travel narratives, geography books, maps, verse, and fiction, Mitsein shows how African strategies of self-representation and European strategies for representing Africa grew increasingly inextricable, as the ideas that Africans presented about themselves and their worlds migrated from contact zones to texts and back again. The geographical narratives that arose from this cycle, which unfolded over hundreds of years, were made to fit expansionist agendas, but they remained rooted in the African worlds and worldviews that shaped them. © 2022 by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia.

"Knowledge of emerging and declining trends and their potential future course is highly relevant in many application domains, particularly in corporate strategy and foresight. The early awareness of trends allows reacting to market, political, and societal changes and challenges at an appropriate time. In our previous works, we presented approaches for the early identification and analysis of emerging trends. Although our previous approaches are detecting emerging trends appropriately, they lack the ability to predict the potential future course of a trend or technology. We present in this work a novel Visual Analytics approach for forecasting emerging trends that combines interactive visualizations with machine learning techniques and statistical approaches to detect, analyze, and predict trends from textual data. We extend our previous work on analyzing technological trends from text and propose an advanced approach that includes forecasting through hybrid techniques consisting of neural networks and established statistical methods. Our approach offers insights from enormous data sets and the potential future course of trends based on their occurrence in textual data. We contribute with a novel approach for identifying and forecasting trends, a hybrid forecasting method to predict trends from text, and interactive visualization techniques on macro level, micro level, and monitoring topics of interest. © 2023 IEEE."
"To confront college students’ new reading patterns and the continuous decline in academic library borrowing rates, we conducted empirical research on promoting multisensory reading as a way to attract students’ attention, and to stimulate interest in, and promote the practice of, reading through a library program called “Reading Today Listening Everyday” (RTLE) on a library’s WeChat public account. The program involved 48 librarians and 105 students who were recruited into different groups to co-create, edit and release multisensory tweets every workday. Multisensory contents including text-based content, audio-based content and emotional resonance were presented to evoke readers’ visual, audio, and emotional senses to induce more reading practice. Using the Context, Input, Process and Product (CIPP) evaluation method, the multisensory presentation in RTLE program was proven to be effective in promoting library reading with a high number of tweeted page views and an increased borrowing rate for recommended books. In 2020, 269 issues accompanied by 269 audio frequencies garnered 80,268 page views, depending on the caliber of the reading promoter out of the 48 librarians and 52 student anchors behind it. The 484 RTLE-recommended books were borrowed 113 times in 2020, which was a rate 1.46 times higher than in 2019 (77 times). The analysis of the relationship between tweet views and borrowing rates for recommended books indicates that more page views indicate greater reader interest, leading to increased borrowing. From readers’ feedback and comments, the gain afforded by multisensory reading can improve higher-level reading trends such as the number of reading interests, enjoyment, engagement, etc. Copyright © 2022 Yu, Jiang, Wu and Cheng."
"[Purpose/Significance] In recent years, there has been a lot of research on the demand for health information, but the research on health information services for the elderly is slightly insufficient. In early 2022, China officially entered the aging society. In addition, people's attention to major public health emergencies brought about by the COVID-19 epidemic triggered the author's thinking about the demand for health information for the elderly under such circumstances. This paper aims to explore the health information needs of the elderly under major public health emergencies, enrich the theoretical content of health information needs and services for the elderly, and provide reference for health information services for the elderly. [Method/Process] In-depth interview was used to collect data from 30 elderly people. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the interview text, code the interview text, and summarize sub-themes. [Results/Conclusions] The results show that the health information needs of the elderly under major public health emergencies can be divided into four categories: disease prevention, disease diagnosis and treatment, health care, mental health and social life. In order to meet their health information needs, this paper proposes information service strategies from the perspective of the government, community and media: 1) the government ensures that information channels are unblocked, and makes full use of scientific and technological means to transmit information. In the Internet era, considering that most elderly people are also active on the We Media and social media platforms, government departments are suggested to make full use of scientific and technological means to update the latest news to the public in a timely manner, such as using emerging social media, We Media (such as Weibo, WeChat official account, Tiktok, etc.) to cooperate with official news agencies, and build smooth information transmission channels with the help of scientific and technological platforms, and expand the scope of information dissemination; 2) to enrich grassroots information dissemination channels by taking community as a unit, in addition to regularly issuing relevant notices and information in the community, we can also carry out targeted publicity lectures, free health clinics and other activities under the professional guidance of relevant institutions to help the elderly obtain health information; 3) to standardize the release of media information and improve the social responsibility of the media industry. This study mainly focuses on the elderly who can take care of themselves. The research object comes from the same community. In the future, more attention may be paid to the semi-disabled and completely disabled elderly, and diversified groups in different environments and regions will be considered. © Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

"The current reactor at the NIST, the National Bureau of Standards Reactor (NBSR) was operational in 1967, serving as a premiere user-facility to the international neutron scattering research community. The NBSR's age has contributed to difficulties like longer outage times and increased maintenance costs, prompting an investigation into a replacement design. The NIST Neutron Source (NNS) is a proposed replacement design to replace the current NBSR. This paper investigates the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the NNS'compact core preliminary design using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. While developing the CFD model, any flow irregularities may significantly affect thermal-hydraulic characteristics such as the core's pressure or velocity profiles. Therefore, a turbulence model must be carefully selected to balance computational costs and model uncertainties. This paper details a sensitivity analysis with multiple turbulence models to evaluate the resulting hydraulic behavior of the coolant flowing from the inlet plenum to the core. Various Reynolds Averaged Navier stokes (RANS) turbulence models in ANSYS Fluent® such as k-ε, k-ω, k-ω SST, realizable k-ε and Spallart-Allmaras are compared. The resulting velocity and pressure profiles for each turbulence model are compared for fit. Discussions of the mesh, assumptions, and boundary conditions are also provided in the text, demonstrating the limitations and methodologies of the study. © 2023 by JSME."
"Over the years, promising returns have enticed the masses to invest in the stock markets. However, most people do not have the financial knowledge needed for making investment decisions. Even seasoned investors find it difficult to grasp all the available information. This is primarily due to the ever-changing market dynamics and information overload. Natural Language Processing based automated systems are the rescue to such problems. In this paper, we present the Financial Language Understandability Enhancement Toolkit (FLUEnT) for processing financial text. It consists of eight different tools for tasks like hypernym detection, numeral claim analysis, readability assessment, sustainability assessment, etc. The objective of the toolkit is to empower the masses and enable investors in making data-driven decisions.

"Background and ObjectivesEarly life epilepsies are common and often debilitating, but no evidence-based management guidelines exist outside of those for infantile spasms. We conducted a systematic review of the effectiveness and harms of pharmacologic and dietary treatments for epilepsy in children aged 1-36 months without infantile spasms.MethodsWe searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library for studies published from January 1, 1999, to August 19, 2021. Using prespecified criteria, we identified studies reporting data on children aged 1-36 months receiving pharmacologic or dietary treatments for epilepsy. We did not require that studies report etiology-specific data. We excluded studies of neonates, infantile spasms, and status epilepticus. We included studies administering 1 of 29 pharmacologic treatments and/or 1 of 5 dietary treatments reporting effectiveness outcomes at ≥ 12 weeks. We reviewed the full text to find any subgroup analyses of children aged 1-36 months.ResultsTwenty-three studies met inclusion criteria (6 randomized studies, 2 nonrandomized comparative studies, and 15 prestudies/poststudies). All conclusions were rated low strength of evidence. Levetiracetam leads to seizure freedom in some infants (32% and 66% in studies reporting seizure freedom), but data on 6 other medications were insufficient to permit conclusions about effectiveness (topiramate, lamotrigine, phenytoin, vigabatrin, rufinamide, and stiripentol). Three medications (levetiracetam, topiramate, and lamotrigine) were rarely discontinued because of adverse effects, and severe events were rare. For diets, the ketogenic diet leads to seizure freedom in some infants (rates 12%-37%), and both the ketogenic diet and modified Atkins diet reduce average seizure frequency, but reductions are greater with the ketogenic diet (1 RCT reported a 71% frequency reduction at 6 months for ketogenic diet vs only a 28% reduction for the modified Atkins diet). Dietary harms were not well-reported.DiscussionLittle high-quality evidence exists on pharmacologic and dietary treatments for early life epilepsies. Future research should isolate how treatments contribute to outcomes, conduct etiology-specific analyses, and report patient-centered outcomes such as hospitalization, neurodevelopment, functional performance, sleep quality, and patient and caregiver quality of life.Trial Registration InformationThis systematic review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021220352) on March 5, 2021.  © American Academy of Neurology."
"Visual Knowledge Discovery (VKD), the emerging research field exploring the integration between Artificial Intelligence and Visual Analytics is impacting a growing number of contexts. This paper dwells on the potential intersections between the VKD perspective and the legal world, a scenario for many reasons drawn by the idea of combining empirical insights offered by computation with intuitive, visually-enhanced forms of data mining. We will focus on criminal justice, taking the cue from an ongoing experimental research project that investigates novel applications of computational social science methods - complex network analysis - to analyze criminal organizations for both scientific and investigative purposes. The work will describe the VKD solutions devised to allow public prosecutors to visually browse the content of phone calls and environmental tapping gathered during preliminary inquiries. We will discuss how given visualizations - graph-based visualizations in the first place - can enhance text mining techniques helping to capture in-a-glance communication flows, discussions' topics and both structural and functional features of criminal networks at hand. © 2023 IEEE."
"I describe in this article the ethos of Brazilians studying Vedanta in India. To understand their experiences, I look into the Vedanta worldview, whose recurrent practices, especially meditation and yoga, accompanied by the study of sacred Hindu texts, are eventually embodied to their lifestyles. My analysis is based on the link between their ongoing studies in India and the significant transformations that occur not only in their lifestyle but also in their worldview. The purpose is to highlight the existence and meaning of some of these transformations, which might even cause a “paradigm shift” (a “native” category) – something so intense that it could lead them to reevaluate their deepest feelings. I, then, examine these transformations as consequences of their spiritual search projects. © 2023, Universidade de Sao Paulo. Museu de Zoologia. All rights reserved."
"In our previous study, we used Naive Bayes to discriminate and quantify approval desire in tweets based on words. To correctly understand a sentence, it is important to consider not only words but also word relationships and grammar. In this study, we investigate the possibility of improving the accuracy of discrimination and quantification of the desire of approval in tweets by weighting word using dependency analysis results and examine and clarify the factors that may lead to improvement. The results of the experiment showed that the correlation coefficients between the classification results with weighting and the evaluators’ ratings increased compared to the correlation coefficients between the classification results without weighting and the evaluators’ ratings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Multimodal machine learning tasks have gained significant popularity and demonstrated promising results in mul-timodal data analysis. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on scenarios where all modalities have complete data, neglecting the challenges posed by missing data. In real-world settings, certain modalities may lack parallel sequences due to noise during data collection and preprocessing, leading to random missingness in each modality. In this paper, we propose an integrated model MM-Align+ that leverages information from three input modalities: audio, visual, and text, to address two important multimodal tasks: sentiment analysis and emotion recognition under missing data with varying rates. We conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, namely MOSEI, MOSI, and MELD. The preliminary results demonstrate the promising performance of the MM-Align+ model and suggest potential for further improvements and novel insights.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Purpose: Existing literature shows that marketing capabilities of new ventures are critical success factors affecting venture capital funding, startup performance and business failure. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether venture capitalists reward extensive marketing strategies in their startup valuation and whether the marketing mix planning and early strategies on customer orientation predict long-term development of startups. Design/methodology/approach: To address these gaps, this study investigate 107 business plans of new ventures which received venture capital based on these planning documents. The authors use computer-aided text analysis and regression analyses. Findings: This study’s findings show that customer orientation has positive effects on new venture performance and intensive marketing mix planning increases the likelihood of survival. However, venture capitalists decrease their startup valuation when they read too much about customer orientation and operative marketing mix planning. Originality/value: This study relies on unique internal documents and therefore provides valuable and new insights for research and practice. Further, this study investigate various short- and long-term effects from marketing and customer orientation for a startups’ development. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"The NIST Neutron Source, or NNS, is a proposed new research reactor at the NIST Center for Neutron Research in the United States of America. The NNS will serve as a state-of-the-art source for neutron scattering and irradiation experiments for the domestic and international community, replacing the currently operational but aging National Bureau of Standards Reactor (NBSR) onsite. The reactor will utilize U-10Mo LEU plate fuel assemblies and be moderated and cooled with light water in an upflow forced convection setup. A custom thermal-hydraulics 1D model is developed to perform preliminary assessments of the core's flow behavior and evaluate the core's safety margins. This paper is concerned with the critical heat flux ratio (CHFR) and the onset of flow instability ratio (OFIR) as safety margins. Under nominal conditions, it is found that both limits remain above the minimum threshold of 2, which is recommended by the US nuclear regulatory commission's NUREG-1537 publication. To evaluate the uncertainty in the safety margins, input sensitivity analyses are performed with stochastic and deterministic approaches. The custom model and sensitivity analysis methodologies are detailed in the text, where uncertainties are provided for both safety margins in terms of expected power, mass flow rate, and inlet coolant temperature variations. The results demonstrate how the sensitivity of the safety margins to the inputs varies based on the sensitivity analysis method, where a deterministic approach shows more linearized trends compared to the stochastic trends. Discussions regarding how the results affect the design are included in the text. © 2023 by JSME."
"The paper presents the results of perceptual experiments (by humans) and automatic recognition of the emotional states of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Intellectual Disabilities (ID) by video, audio and text modalities. The participants of the study were 50 children aged 5 - 15 years: 25 children with ASD, 25 children with ID, and 20 adults - the participants of the perceptual experiment. Automatic analysis of facial expression by video was performed using FaceReader software runs on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform and convolutional neural network. Automatic recognition of the emotional states of children by speech was carried out using a recurrent neural network. This study was conducted in accordance with the design developed in the study of the recognition of the emotional states of children with Down syndrome by facial expression, voice, and text. The results of the perceptual experiment showed a greater accuracy in recognizing the emotional states of children with ASD and ID in comparison with automatic classification. The emotions of children with ASD are more accurately recognized by the video modality, children with ID - by the text modality. The novelty of the research is the comparative results for groups of children with similar and overlapping symptoms of ASD and ID, and in setting tasks related to the analysis of the emotional sphere of children with atypical development. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Providing the first sustained scholarly analysis of the Black nanny figure in Alexandra Fuller’s Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight: An African Childhood (2001), this article highlights the memoir’s problematic visual economies as a white-written memoir of a colonial Southern African childhood with occluded photographic representations of Black women nannies. The article signals the limitations of hegemonic approaches to images, particularly in materials treated primarily as literary. Only by accounting for Fuller’s use of photography can we appreciate the importance and shape of the memoir’s racial and gender politics. Drawing on theories of family photography and intersectional, Black feminist accounts of visibility, the article analyzes the two images of Black women in Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight, revealing a dialectic of whiteness producing Blackness as its abject other, while Blackness remains crucial to, but occluded from, the production of the white colonial family. The article concludes that the co-constitution of visible whiteness and occluded Blackness mirrors the ethnocentric and masculinist hierarchies of colonialism and maps onto hegemonic medial hierarchies that privilege text above image. Where Blackness/images are the denigrated other—necessary but occluded—whiteness/text is a figuration of authority. This dynamic underscores the need for more perceptive and decolonizing methods of reading texts containing images. © University of Tulsa, 2023. All rights to reproduction in any form are reserved."

"In real-world scenarios, it is common that a video contains multiple actors and their activities. Selectively localizing one specific actor and its action spatially and temporally via a language query becomes a vital and challenging task. Existing fully supervised methods require extensive elaborately annotated data and are sensitive to the class labels, which cannot satisfy real-world applications' needs. Thus, we introduce the task of weakly supervised actor-action video segmentation from a sentence query (AAVSS) in this work, where only the video-sentence pairs are provided. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to perform AAVSS under weakly supervised situations. However, this task is extremely challenging not only because the task aims to learn the complex interactions between two heterogeneous modalities but also because the task needs to learn fine-grained analysis of video content without pixel-level annotations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a two-stage network. The network first follows the sentence guidance to localize the candidate region and then performs segmentation to achieve selective segmentation. Specifically, a novel tracker-based clip-level multiple instance learning paradigm is proposed in this article to learn the matches between regions and sentences, which makes our two-stage network robust to the region proposal network. Furthermore, two intrinsic characteristics of the video, temporal consistency and motion information, are utilized in companion with the weak supervision to facilitate the region-query matching. Through extensive experiments, the proposed method achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art fully supervised approaches on two large-scale benchmarks, including A2D Sentences and J-HMDB Sentences. © 2023 Association for Computing Machinery."
"Fuzzy joins are widely used in a variety of data analysis applications such as data integration, data mining, and master data management. In the context of Big Data, computing fuzzy joins is challenging due to the high computational cost required and the communication cost. While on one hand big fuzzy joins on relational data and on the other hand joins on tree-structured data have been investigated in the literature, to the best of our knowledge, combining the two is still an open problem. In this context, we study methods for leveraging distributed environments in order to compute fuzzy joins over large collections of JSON documents. Our algorithms take into account both the text-similarity of the joining data, as well as its structural similarity. © 2023 IEEE."
"Background: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses related to high-intensity functional training (HIFT) have been conducted. However, due to a restricted pool of available research, these investigations are often limited in scope. As such, a scoping review investigating the present literature surrounding the acute physiological response to HIFT-based exercise was chosen as a more appropriate structured review. Methodology: A scoping review was conducted following Arksey and O'Malley's framework. Three large scale databases were searched to reveal any article pertaining to HIFT and related exercise terminology. Results: A total of 2, 241 articles were found during the initial search. Following this, titles, then abstracts, and full-texts were reviewed to determine inclusion eligibility. A total of 60 articles which investigated a combined total of 35 unique HIFT workouts were included within this review. Conclusions: A variety of physiological parameters and HIFT workouts have been examined. Markers of intensity (e.g., blood lactate concentrations, heart rate) have been most consistently assessed across all studies, and these support the idea that HIFT workouts are typically performed at high-intensity. In contrast, the inclusion of most other measures (e.g., hormonal, markers of inflammation and damage, energy expenditure, performance) has been inconsistent and has thus, limited the possibility for making generalized conclusions. Differences in study methodologies have further impacted conclusions, as different studies have varied in sample population characteristics, workouts assessed, and time points. Though it may be impossible to comprehensively research all possible HIFT workouts, consistent adoption of population definitions and workload quantification may overcome this challenge and assist with future comparisons.

"Dysregulation of sleep heightens pain sensitivity and may contribute to pain chronification. Interventions which consolidate and lengthen sleep have the potential to improve pain control. The main objective of this systematic review was to examine the effects of sleep-promoting pharmacotherapy on pain intensity in patients with chronic pain. Multiple electronic databases were searched from inception to January 2022 to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two independent reviewers screened titles, abstracts, and full-text articles; extracted data; and assessed risk of bias for each included study. The GRADE approach was used to determine the strength of evidence. The search identified 624 articles. After full-text screening, 10 RCTs (n = 574 randomized participants) involving 3 pharmacologic interventions (melatonin, zopiclone, and eszopiclone) and 7 different chronic pain populations were included. Minimum clinically significant pain reduction ≥30% was reported in 4 studies. There is low-quality evidence (downgraded due to inconsistency and imprecision) that 2 to 8 weeks treatment with a sleep-promoting medication alone or in combination with an analgesic (6 trials, n = 397) decreases pain intensity compared with placebo or the same analgesic treatment alone (SMD -0.58 [95% confidence interval -1.00, -0.17], P = 0.006). Analyses of associations between changes in sleep and pain outcomes were only provided in 2 articles, with inconsistent findings. Notably, pain-relieving effects were most consistent in melatonin trials. Only 3 studies implemented polysomnography to obtain objective sleep measures. Low-quality evidence indicates that pharmacologic sleep promotion may decrease pain intensity in chronic pain populations. More research is needed to fully understand the influence of sleep-targeting interventions on pain control.  © 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc."
"I analyze Israel president Rivlin's 2020 speech delivered against the background of ongoing COVID-19 health threats and a severe political crisis, and its follow-ups in online news articles and in ordinary readers' comments on news sites and on Facebook. I examine the recontextualization practices used in this three-part discourse event, shedding light on their diversity and focusing on the degree of directness they manifest. Recontextualization is conceptualized as the strategic molding of situations and prior texts and their integration into another discourse through discursive practices. The analysis shows that the president recontextualizes the complex political and social crisis through the lens of the COVID-19 pandemic. He frames the pandemic in terms of its morbid, mythic, and moral dimensions, as well as its influence on various aspects of civil and political disorder. This connection is drawn through the juxtaposition of propositions and the shifts between the deliberative and the epidictic keyings, alluding to Jewish tradition, prayers, and blessings. Through the use of the inclusive “we,” he self-positions as a leader on a par with ordinary people, whereas through direct demands formulated in the plural without personal naming he addresses his ratified addressees, the MPs and the ministers, and thus self-positions as an authority demanding accountability from the current leadership. The news articles in leading online media are short and partial, recontextualizing the speech and the situation through their titles, the selection of the extracts they chose to present and the very few evaluations they make. They mostly take up the president's moral framing and some of his explicit demands for political accountability. The commenters mostly follow up on the moral framing and the mythic dimensions proposed by the president but offer a different perspective on these issues. They shift the responsibility for “losing the compass” from the collective “we” advocated by the president to the politicians including the president, and they ironically echo the epidictic keying in order to challenge and even ridicule it. They further add another dimension to the speech event, by framing the president's speech as politically biased. The discursive patterns used all along this thread of discourses by all its participants range in degree of directness and recontextualize the object of talk, perspectives, keying and positionings.

"Using social media to mine disaster information (situational awareness) is of great significance for disaster management. With the development of technology, researchers began to attempt to use social media data for situational awareness. In this paper, a spatial and temporal evolution framework of disaster situation is proposed. Combining the LDA model, UIE model and kernel density estimation method, the spatial and temporal evolution of rainstorm disaster situation in the interested period is analyzed. The results indicate that the location in social media texts can more accurately reflect disaster information, help to quickly understand disaster dynamics, and provide scientific basis for decision-making by governments and rescue organizations. © 2023 SPIE."

"The article considers sound prolongations as one of the most typical hesitation phenomena of spontaneous spoken speech in any language. The material for the analysis was 40 monologues-descriptions, partly taken from the corpus of Russian monologue speech “Balanced Annotated Text Library”, and partly recorded specifically for this study. The monologues were recorded from 4 groups of speakers: 10 Russians and 30 Chinese, of whom 10 described the comic strip in Russian and Chinese, and another 10 only in Chinese. The analysis showed that the appearance of prolongations correlates with the language factor: bilinguals use them more often than monolinguals. More prolongations were found in full-fledged words (not pragmatic markers), but most of them are function words and pronouns. In Russian speech, the percentage of prolongations is also high in pragmatic markers, especially in the word vot, which appears in spoken discourse most often as a hesitative boundary marker. Thus, it turned out that even language proficiency does not make the Russian colloquial speech of the Chinese as natural as one of the native speakers. Prolongations predominate in vowels and sonorants; they are frequent at the end of a word and in single-letter words. Often prolongations become a component of an extended hesitation chain that includes other hesitative units (physical hesitation pauses, breaks, repetitions, vocalizations, etc.). The data obtained can be useful in all aspects of applied linguistics: from linguodidactics and linguistic expertise to automatic speech processing systems and the creation of artificial intelligence. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Subnational disparities in most health systems often defy 'one-size-fits-all' approach in policy implementation. When local authorities implement a national policy in a decentralized context, they behave as a strategic policy actor in specifying the central mandates, selecting appropriate tools and setting key implementation parameters. Local policy discretion leads to diverse policy mixes across regions, thus complicating evidence-based evaluations of policy impacts. When measuring complex policy reforms, mainstream policy evaluation methodologies have tended to adopt simplified policy proxies that often disguise distinct policy choices across localities, leaving the heterogeneous effects of the same generic policy largely unknown. Using the emerging 'text-as-data' methodology and drawing from subnational policy documents, this study developed a novel approach to policy measurement through analysing policy big data. We applied this approach to examine the impacts of China's Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (UEBMI) on individuals' out-of-pocket (OOP) spending. We found substantial disparities in policy choices across prefectures when categorizing the UEBMI policy framework into benefit-expansion and cost-containment reforms. Overall, the UEBMI policies lowered enrollees' OOP spending in prefectures that embraced both benefit-expansion and cost-containment reforms. In contrast, the policies produced ill effects on OOP spending of UEBMI enrollees and uninsured workers in prefectures that carried out only benefit-expansion or cost-containment reforms. The micro-level impacts of UEBMI enrolment on OOP spending were conditional on whether prefectural benefit-expansion and cost-containment reforms were undertaken in concert. Only in prefectures that promulgated both types of reforms did UEBMI enrolment reduce OOP spending. These findings contribute to a comprehensive text-mining measurement approach to locally diverse policy efforts and an integration of macro-level policy analysis and micro-level individual analysis. Contextualizing policy measurements would improve the methodological rigour of health policy evaluations. This paper concludes with implications for health policymakers in China and beyond. © The Author(s) 2022.

"Social media serves as a platform for sharing information and connecting with others on various subjects, including healthcare and drugs. Analyzing drug sentiment from various social media like Twitter, reddit, quora etc are crucial for monitoring drug safety, identifying adverse reactions, and providing an early warning system for potential safety concerns, benefiting healthcare organizations and governments. This paper aims to study the opinions of people from all over the world by analyzing their messages, posts on social media. For this study 39,069 drug related message corpus were fetched making a comparison between the high income countries, and middle income and low income countries on the basis of drug consumption from 2021 to 2023. The dataset used for the study consisted of 41.63% text-corpus from high income countries out of which on an average from 2021 to 2023, 40.2% was found to have a positive sentiment. Whereas 34.65% of text-corpus are from middle-income countries out of which on an average 26.4% of was of a positive sentiment and 23.70% text-corpus are from low income countries with 23.6% having a positive sentiment. Furthermore, the primary factor for having such differences from people’s sentiment on drug consumption from high to low income countries includes Cultural and Social Norms, Legalization, availability etc therefore, In high-income countries, drug use is more socially accepted than in other regions. This proposed study gives an insight into people’s opinion on various drugs from different countries and regions. The results of this study attempted to understand how the public is responding to different types of information and to identify potential misinformation which can be used to formulate policies for existing and future drug prevention campaigns in order to improve public health and promote public education. © 2023 SCPE.

"In the field of asset management, a Work Order refers to a document that outlines the necessary steps to carry out a maintenance operation on a specific physical asset. The text on this Work orders providing details about the problem and the actions required are open-ended, not normalized, and Technician' dependant, presenting challenges for automating asset management Work Order processing. To address the issue of automating the analysis of Work Orders, Natural Language Processing techniques are employed to process the content of these documents. The aim is to identify and extract relevant information related to actions and components within the sentences. This paper presents the Reliability Centred Maintenance for Assets solution, which utilizes a semi-automatic, human-in-the-loop approach to determine a standardised and condensed set of actions and components. The results indicate a significant increase in the number of annotations, reaching a ratio of 1:14. By implementing this solution, the manual workload associated with analysing Work Orders can be reduced, thereby improving decision support and analytical processing of the data contained within these documents. © 2023 IEEE."
"BACKGROUND: Streptoccocal A (Strep A, GAS) infections in Australia are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality through both invasive (iGAS) and post-streptococcal (postGAS) diseases as well as preceding superficial (sGAS) skin and throat infection. The burden of iGAS and postGAS are addressed in some jurisdictions by mandatory notification systems; in contrast, the burden of preceding sGAS has no reporting structure, and is less well defined. This review provides valuable, contemporaneous evidence on the epidemiology of sGAS presentations in Australia, informing preventative health projects such as a Streptococcal A vaccine and standardisation of primary care notification. METHODS AND FINDINGS: MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, Global Health, Cochrane, CINAHL databases and the grey literature were searched for studies from an Australian setting relating to the epidemiology of sGAS infections between 1970 and 2020 inclusive. Extracted data were pooled for relevant population and subgroup analysis. From 5157 titles in the databases combined with 186 grey literature reports and following removal of duplicates, 4889 articles underwent preliminary title screening. The abstract of 519 articles were reviewed with 162 articles identified for full text review, and 38 articles identified for inclusion. The majority of data was collected for impetigo in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, remote communities, and in the Northern Territory, Australia. A paucity of data was noted for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in urban centres or with pharyngitis. Prevalence estimates have not significantly changed over time. Community estimates of impetigo point prevalence ranged from 5.5-66.1%, with a pooled prevalence of 27.9% [95% CI: 20.0-36.5%]. All studies excepting one included >80% Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and all excepting two were in remote or very remote settings. Observed prevalence of impetigo as diagnosed in healthcare encounters was lower, with a pooled estimate of 10.6% [95% CI: 3.1-21.8%], and a range of 0.1-50.0%. Community prevalence estimates for pharyngitis ranged from 0.2-39.4%, with a pooled estimate of 12.5% [95% CI: 3.5-25.9%], higher than the prevalence of pharyngitis in healthcare encounters; ranging from 1.0-5.0%, and a pooled estimate of 2.0% [95% CI: 1.3-2.8%]. The review was limited by heterogeneity in study design and lack of comparator studies for some populations. CONCLUSIONS: Superficial Streptococcal A infections contribute to an inequitable burden of disease in Australia and persists despite public health interventions. The burden in community studies is generally higher than in health-services settings, suggesting under-recognition, possible normalisation and missed opportunities for treatment to prevent postGAS. The available, reported epidemiology is heterogeneous. Standardised nation-wide notification for sGAS disease surveillance must be considered in combination with the development of a Communicable Diseases Network of Australia (CDNA) Series of National Guideline (SoNG), to accurately define and address disease burden across populations in Australia.

"Traditional models for short text clustering ignore the time information associated with the text documents. However, existing works have shown that temporal characteristics of streaming documents are significant features for clustering. In this paper we propose a stacked Dirichlet-Hawkes process with inverse cluster frequency prior as a simple but effective solution for the task of short text clustering using temporal features in continuous time. Based on the classical formulation of the Dirichlet-Hawkes process, our model provides an elegant, theoretically grounded and interpretable solution while performing at par with recent state of the art models in short text clustering.  © 2023 ACM."

"The article problematizes gender stereotyping in election campaigns as a discourse practice in media coverage, but also the discourse strategies used by candidates during elections where they are negotiating between gender iden-tity and party positions that they are in. The method used in the research is discourse analysis carried out on five Croatian news portals that mention party candidates during the campaigns for the local mayoral elections in 2021. This research introduces and explains three levels of analysis: political campaigns as a social practice, media coverage of elections as a form of discourse prac-tice, and the articles themselves. The research has shown that female politicians were placed in gender-stereotyped frameworks where their political role was reduced to trivialization and an exception in the political arena. The candidates themselves accept these stereotypes so they could survive in the system and represent themselves as caretakers, women devoted to the party, and experts. © 2023, Faculty of Political Sciences, University of Zagreb.

"Purpose: This research aims to investigate how entrepreneurial orientation influences a firm’s differentiation–cost advantage ambidexterity (DCAA) and performance indirectly through dynamic capabilities, while also investigating the impact of the interactive effect of the level and consistency of entrepreneurial orientation on dynamic capabilities. The goal of this study is to better understand the importance of consistently following an entrepreneurial orientation, as well as the linkage of such a consistently implemented strategy upon gaining both a cost and differentiation positioning enhancement. Design/methodology/approach: Two empirical studies are conducted to test the proposed hypotheses – one longitudinal with multiple forms of data (i.e. text data, survey data and archival data) from 100 Taiwanese electronics firms and the other using primary data from a survey of senior managers. Findings: Entrepreneurial orientation improves dynamic capabilities, which in turn promote superior DCAA and enhanced firm performance. In addition, as captured through a unique measure of consistency allowed through computer-aided text analysis, the results indicate that the effect of entrepreneurial orientation on dynamic capabilities is amplified when a firm consistently adopts entrepreneurial decisions and actions. Research limitations/implications: The specific context was a sample of electronics firms in Taiwan. This limits the generalization of findings, as would be possible with assessing the hypotheses in other industries. Practical implications: This research clearly demonstrates the significance of consistency in pursuing a strategic orientation. The consistent support and deployment of resources facilitates an organization’s achieving positive outcomes associated with an entrepreneurial orientation. Originality/value: While entrepreneurial orientation contributes to firm performance, extant knowledge on the internal process through which entrepreneurial orientation affects performance is relatively limited. The findings not only highlight the full mediating role of dynamic capabilities and DCAA, but also shed light on the importance of consistency in entrepreneurial orientation over time. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Purpose: This paper aims to analyze a decolonized peace with gender perspective. Liberal democracies had consolidated on conquest, slavery, racism, sexism, colonialism, raw material extraction and female exploitation. Additional burdens came from neoliberal globalization with the massive burning of fossil oil, changing the Earth's history from the Holocene toward the Anthropocene. Multiple nexus between the human and environmental system requires an epistemology from the Global South. The paper explores alternative peace paradigms enabling poor and exploited people to overcome the destructive outcomes of patriarchal violence and extractivism. Regionally and locally, they are experimenting with just, safe, equal and sustainable alternatives of free societies. Design/methodology/approach: The nexus approach focuses on system efficiency, internal and external feedbacks and allows decision-making processes with stronger cross-sectoral coordination and multi-level governance. It includes the understanding of the policy agenda and the political actors at different levels, explaining the discrimination of gender from local to global. The analysis establishes complex relations between theory and political actions, due that all actions are inherently mediated by gender. A key focus is a relationship and the outcomes of policies, where communication and collaboration at the local level grant efficient peaceful resource management with gender equity. Findings: An engendered-sustainable peace approach is culturally decentralized and may offer alternatives to the ongoing destruction process of neoliberal corporatism and violence. Drastic systemic change requires massive changes from bottom-up and top-down before 2030–2050. Global solidarity among all excluded people, especially women and girls, promotes from childhood an engendered-sustainable peace-building process, where positive feedbacks may reduce the tipping points on Earth and among humankind. Engendered-sustainable peace can mitigate the upcoming conflicts and catastrophes, limiting the negative feedbacks from abusive, selfish and destructive corporations. A greater self-regulating sustainable system with a HUGE-security could promote a decolonized, engendered and sustainable peace for everybody. Research limitations/implications: The interconnected risks are cascading across different domains, where systemic challenges have intensified conflicts and violence, due to uncertainty, instability and fragility. Cascading effects not only demand prevention for sudden disruptions (hurricanes, floods) but also for slow-ongoing processes (drought, sea-level rise, lack of water availability, etc.), which are equally or more disruptive. Women suffer differently from disasters and are prone to greater impacts on their life and livelihood. An engendered peace is limited by the deep engrained patriarchal system. Only a culture of peace with gender recognition may grant future peace and also the sustainable care of ecosystems. Practical implications: The Global South is exploring alternative ways to overcome the present violent and destructive globalization by promoting deep engrained indigenous values of Aymaras’ living well, the shell model of commanding by obeying of the Zapatistas or Bhutan’s Happiness Index. Globally, critical women and men are promoting subsistence agriculture, solidarity or gift economy, where local efforts are restoring the equilibrium between humans and nature. An engendered-sustainable peace is limiting the destructive impacts of the Anthropocene, climate change and ongoing pandemics. Social implications: An engendered-sustainable peace is culturally decentralized and offers alternatives to the ongoing destruction process of neoliberal corporatism, climate change and violence. The text explores how to overcome the present hybrid warfare with alternative HUGE security and peace from the bottom-up. Regional reinforcement of food security, safe water management, local jobs and a concordian economy for the most vulnerable may change the present exploitation of nature and humankind. Growing solidarity with people affected by disasters is empowering women and girls and dismantling from the bottom-up, the dominant structures of violence and exploitation. Originality/value: The military-industrial-scientific corporate complex and the exploitation of women, men and natural resources, based on patriarchy, has produced climate change, poverty and global pandemics with millions of unnecessary deaths and suffering. A doughnut engendered peace looking from the outside and inside of the system of globalization and environmental destruction proposes to overcome the growth addiction by a growth agnostic society. Engendered peace explores alternative and sustainable values that go beyond the dominant technological changes. It includes a culturally, politically and institutionally ingrained model where everybody is a participant, reinforcing an engendered-sustainable peace and security for everybody. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Background: In 2022, there were outbreaks of Mpox where the disease is not endemic. We summarized published full-text epidemiological data from the outbreaks. Methods: A global evidence review (protocol: osf.io/j3kb7) with systematic literature search up to February 09, 2023. We focused on experimental/observational studies of laboratory confirmed Mpox, excluding case reports and case series of < 5 cases. Epidemiological data were pooled using an inverse variance, random-effects model, and pooled estimates presented with associated 95% confidence intervals. Results: We included 66 studies. Mean incubation period was 7.8 days (6.6–9.0 days, 8 studies: 560 cases), reproductive number 1.8 (1.7–1.9, 6 studies), mean duration from symptom onset to diagnosis 5.8 days (4.8–6.8 days, 4 studies: 982 cases), mean symptom duration 17.5 days (14.7–20.2 days, 3 studies: 292 cases), mean serial interval 8.5 days (7.3–9.9 days, 1 study), hospitalisation 6% (4–9%, 26 studies: 5339 cases), and vaccine effectiveness 78% (65–91%, 3 studies: 953 cases). Highly relevant clinical manifestations were pleomorphic skin lesions 82% (68–94%, 26 studies: 4093 cases), anogenital lesions 64% (51–77%, 9 studies: 10,398 cases), fever 54% (50–57%, 52 studies: 25,992 cases), and lymphadenopathy 51% (46–57%, 42 studies: 17,803 cases), with cases mostly men who have sex with men (MSM). Possibly relevant manifestations were perianal lesions, fatigue, asthenia, myalgia, and headache. Conclusions: The 2022 Mpox outbreaks presented with sex-related clinical manifestations and were mostly reported among MSM. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."
"Japan's aging population has led to a shortage of caregivers, and the government is focusing on community-based care to manage healthcare for elderly individuals. To prevent abnormal conditions in the elderly, a systematic organization of caregiving records is necessary, with flexible support tailored to individual needs. In this study, we therefore propose a new method of analysis using Growing Neural Gas hierarchically to systematically organize and restructure caregiving record text data. The topological approach does not require prior knowledge of the number of clusters. Moreover, we conducted validation studies on Japanese nursing care records and clustered caregivers' comments and descriptions of robot care and support in each incident. The experimental results show potential for incident prevention through shared knowledge among caregivers and care receivers. © 2023 IEEE."
"Language policy, which is directly concerned with language practice, language ideology and language management, has become increasingly important in real social life. Explicit language policies in different fields, such as texts in law, education, and the public, have been explored for many years. However, the global comparative research on language policies in various constitutional texts (CT) is quite limited. In response, the present study aimed to investigate the framework and features of language policies in global CT through a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis. Results showed that: 1) there were seven parts of the CT dealing with language policies, such as Preamble, General principle, The state, Fundamental rights and Duties of citizen, State authority, National objectives, and Supplementary; 2) there existed significant differences in the frequency of language policies in seven parts of the CT. Among them, language policies appeared most frequently in the part of Fundamental rights and duties of citizen; 3) the geographical location where the Constitution was enacted affected the distribution of language policies across parts. Overall, our findings suggested that the language policy in CT was influenced not only by constitutional principles, but also by the national language environment.

"Much of the complexity within cells arises from functional and regulatory interactions among proteins. The core of these interactions is increasingly known, but novel interactions continue to be discovered, and the information remains scattered across different database resources, experimental modalities and levels of mechanistic detail. The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) systematically collects and integrates protein-protein interactions - both physical interactions as well as functional associations. The data originate from a number of sources: automated text mining of the scientific literature, computational interaction predictions from co-expression, conserved genomic context, databases of interaction experiments and known complexes/pathways from curated sources. All of these interactions are critically assessed, scored, and subsequently automatically transferred to less well-studied organisms using hierarchical orthology information. The data can be accessed via the website, but also programmatically and via bulk downloads. The most recent developments in STRING (version 12.0) are: (i) it is now possible to create, browse and analyze a full interaction network for any novel genome of interest, by submitting its complement of encoded proteins, (ii) the co-expression channel now uses variational auto-encoders to predict interactions, and it covers two new sources, single-cell RNA-seq and experimental proteomics data and (iii) the confidence in each experimentally derived interaction is now estimated based on the detection method used, and communicated to the user in the web-interface. Furthermore, STRING continues to enhance its facilities for functional enrichment analysis, which are now fully available also for user-submitted genomes.  © 2023 The Author(s)."

"In the UK, the Research Excellence Framework is a mechanism used for ranking the quality of research in higher education institutions. While there has been analysis of the entire Research Excellence Framework, and of the Education unit of assessment more generally, analysis of how research on initial teacher education featured in the Research Excellence Framework has been minimal. In this article, we report on Phase I of an 18-month project that mapped the extent to which initial teacher education-focused research was included in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework. Employing a novel methodology and a theoretical framework based on policy as text and discourse, we identify a sample of 12 higher education institutions that provided initial teacher education programmes and returned outputs to the 2014 Research Excellence Framework. Analysis of over 1,600 outputs suggest that in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework only 5.5 per cent of these were focused on initial teacher education. We discuss the methodological approach, some headline findings and areas for future research, arguing that these add evidence to the literature of initial teacher education-focused research and, in doing so, can inform policy at the levels of schools, higher education institutions, Research Excellence Framework and the government. We conclude that although the Research Excellence Framework only concerns the UK, similar exercises are becoming increasingly prevalent globally, and therefore the extent to which research on initial teacher education was marginalised in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework is of interest to all concerned with teacher education. 2023, Andrew Clapham, Ruth Richards, Katie Lonsdale and Linda la Velle."
"According to programs of study for the teaching of French in Canada, students must learn to write various genres of texts, thinking about their intention and mobilizing various writing strategies. Tis objective poses a signifcant challenge for students from the Francophone linguistic minority community. Moreover, certain current teaching practices tend to reinforce the linguistic insecurity of these students, impede the development of their ability to write, marginalizing minoritized students by favouring dominant repertoires. Tis observation leads us to rethink our practices to promote written discourse that develops students’ confdence in their skills as writers. Te article presents a teaching model that devotes signifcant attention to writing strategies and that has been adapted to better respond to the needs of a diverse population. Te choice of these components draws on research conducted in the following felds: editorial expertise from a cognitive psychology perspective, discourse analysis, social constructivism, teaching practices and culturally sustainable pedagogy.

"Cyberbullying is one of the complicated problems in Arabic communities. Cyberbullying detection is the main key to control racism and hate speech over the Internet especially on social media. Detection of cyberbullying in Arabic is challenging due to the variety of expressions and different Arabic dialects. Many researches discussed this topic using only one dialect and achieved good results. In this paper, we consolidated datasets with multiple Arabic dialects from different social media platforms. Text pre-processing enhanced the performance of the used models. We classified the comments in the dataset using Naive Bayes model, AraBERT model and ChatGPT for comparison purposes. The experiments showed that AraBERT outperformed the other classifiers for our multi-dialect dataset showing its potential for effectively monitoring Arabic content over the Internet. © 2023 IEEE."
"BACKGROUND: Mindfulness training programs and non-invasive brain stimulation are both evidence-based interventions that have applications in mental health disorders. While both have showed promising results on a range of symptoms related to mental health, their combination has more recently grabbed the attention of researchers. There is a theoretical framework for their synergistic effects, and these effects can be tested through a variety of neurophysiological and clinical outcomes. This emerging field of research, which is regularly extended with new trials, has not yet been systematically reviewed. This systematic review protocol aims to present a rationale for combining these two interventions and to document the methodical approach to our systematic review before data extraction. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Four electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO) and three clinical trial registries (Clinical Trials, EU Trials, WHO ICTRP) were searched. All randomized controlled trials testing the combination of mindfulness-based interventions and non-invasive brain stimulation in humans will be included. As primary outcome, data on change in anxiety and depression symptoms from baseline, and, as secondary outcomes, other mental health outcomes data will be gathered. Data will be extracted independently by two authors using a predefined extraction form. Depending on the clinical heterogeneity of the included studies, the research team will decide whether a quantitative synthesis is appropriate for each of the predefined outcomes. If there is considerable statistical heterogeneity, subgroup analyses and meta-regression will be performed. Bias will be assessed using a revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials and the strength of evidence in our review will be assessed using the GRADE form in GRADEPro. We started our scoping searches in November 2022. This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol was finished and submitted before the end of the independent full-text selection process by two members of the team. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethics approval and consent to participate were not applicable to our systematic review. Our dissemination plan includes the publication of our systematic review and meta-analysis in an international peer-reviewed journal as well as international communication of our results.

"When exploring the characteristics of a discourse domain associated with texts, keyword analysis is widely used in corpus linguistics. However, one of the challenges facing this method is the evaluation of the quality of the keywords. Here, we propose casting keyword analysis as a prediction problem with the goal of discriminating the texts associated with the target corpus from the reference corpus. We demonstrate that, when using linear support vector machines, this approach can be used not only to quantify the discrimination between the two corpora, but also extract keywords. To evaluate the keywords, we develop a systematic and rigorous approach anchored to the concepts of usefulness and relevance used in machine learning. The extracted keywords are compared with the recently proposed text dispersion keyness measure. We demonstrate that that our approach extracts keywords that are highly useful and linguistically relevant, capturing the characteristics of their discourse domain.

"Japanese essayist Maki Fukasawa coined the term sôshoku danshi ‘herbivore men’ to refer to men who are not assertive or proactive in engaging with romantic or sexual relationships with women. Since her 2006 article, dozens of related kei ‘types’ have proliferated across the digital landscape, creating a taxonomy of binary-based gender classifications. This article describes the kei system through an analysis of digital texts, first providing the historical context of this discourse, then overviewing its grammar and taxonomic structure. An analysis of heuristic types then reveals how heteronormativity and gender hegemony emerge and limit the subversive potential of this system. Finally, the article discusses how neoliberalism creates the niche occupied by kei and enables its sustained appeal. The article contributes to research on both kei and identity by analysing kei as a system, attending to the ways in which broad social forces shape self-identification. © 2023, equinox publishing."
"Purpose: The paper aims to examine how employees influence their employer’s brand by applying Taylor’s (1999) six segment message strategy wheel in an employee influencer context. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses a content analysis of employees’ public social media posts – including captions and images – to analyze the message strategies employees use to promote their employers. Findings: While ego and social were popular message strategies in both the images and captions, the findings evidence the varying message strategies employees use in text-based versus image-based messages. Four “imagined audiences” of employee influencers are identified: current customers, prospective customers, current employees and prospective employees. Research limitations/implications: The research provides insight into how employees act as influencers in building their employer brand on social media. Practical implications: A unique measurement tool is developed that can be used by companies and future researchers to decode employees’ online communications. Originality/value: This research contributes to theory and practice in the following important ways. First, the research provides a modernization of an existing framework from an offline setting to an applied industry context in an online setting. Second, this research focuses on a subtype of social media influencer, the employee influencer, which is an underdeveloped area of research. Third, a unique measurement tool to analyze text-based and image-based social media data is developed that can be used by companies and future researchers to decode employees’ online communications. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Objectives To identify the barriers and enablers to implementing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) recommendations in primary care and to provide recommendations that could facilitate the uptake of CPGs recommendations. Design An overview of systematic reviews. Data sources Nine electronic databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Journals @Ovid Full Text, EMBase, JBI) and three online data sources for guidelines (Turning Research Into Practice, the National Guideline Clearinghouse and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) were searched until May 2021. Eligibility criteria Systematic reviews, meta-analyses or other types of systematic synthesis of quantitative, qualitative or mixed-methods studies on the topic of barriers and/or enablers for CPGs implementation in primary care were included. Data extraction and synthesis Two authors independently screened the studies and extracted the data using a predesigned data extraction form. The methodological quality of the included studies was appraised by using the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist for Systematic Reviews and Research Syntheses. Content analysis was used to synthesise the data. Results Twelve systematic reviews were included. The methodological quality of the included reviews was generally robust. Six categories of barriers and enablers were identified, which include (1) political, social and culture factors, (2) institutional environment and resources factors, (3) guideline itself related factors, (4) healthcare provider-related factors, (5) patient-related factors and (6) behavioural regulation-related factors. The most commonly reported barriers within the above-mentioned categories were suboptimal healthcare networks and interprofessional communication pathways, time constraints, poor applicability of CPGs in real-world practice, lack of knowledge and skills, poor motivations and adherence, and inadequate reinforcement (eg, remuneration). Presence of technical support ( € institutional environment and resources factors'), and timely education and training for both primary care providers (PCPs) ( € healthcare provider-related factors') and patients ( € patient-related factors') were the frequently reported enablers. Conclusion Policy-driven strategies should be developed to motivate different levels of implementation activities, which include optimising resources allocations, promoting integrated care models, establishing well-coordinated multidisciplinary networks, increasing technical support, encouraging PCPs and patients' engagement in guideline development, standardising the reporting of guidelines, increasing education and training, and stimulating PCPs and patients' motivations. All the activities should be conducted by fully considering the social, cultural and community contexts to ensure the success and sustainability of CPGs implementation. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

"Social media platforms have emerged as a significant source of public opinion, offering a massive user-generated data in which user-opinions are valuable if obtainable. Large language models (LLMs) have been in the spotlight recently with suggestions on the emergent abilities to solve tasks that are not explicitly trained for. Thus, this study explores the potential of utilizing LLMs for opinion mining on social media data by asking LLMs difficult questions, instead of simply asking whether the text's sentiment polarity is either positive, negative, or neutral. This study compares the LLM response statistics and the corresponding public surveys related to COVID-19, including the intention to take vaccination and the stress check. The results indicate that it is promising, but also challenging, to utilize LLMs for the tasks.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Introduction: The text departs from a theoretical review to distinguish two specific dynamics involv-ing the use of commercial tools by activists on the one hand, and the development of autonomous technologies driven by social movements themselves on the other. Objectives: The objective of this article is to define various logics of digital activism by engaging critically with several scholarly contributions that, generally through a historical analysis, allow us to establish theoretical distinctions and recognize differentiated logics of action when it comes to determining how social movements actually use digital technology. In the paper, critical engagement with the literature is examined against our empirical findings to challenge pre-existing assumptions, as well as evolutionary approaches some-times observed in some of these contributions. The text also makes a point of transcending closed historical stages. Conclusions: The article’s conclusions point towards a multidimensionality of factors (pragmatic-utilitarian, strategic-tactical, and ideological/identity-related) regulating how social movements leverage technology. © 2023, University of La Laguna.

"A discourse-based approach to understanding security has been explored in the study of International Relations, yet how other agents rather than the political agents speak to conceptualize the emotive appeal in unconventional security issues is less discussed. This corpus-based cognitive critical discourse study examines security by combining the International Relations’ theory of securitization with the proximization approach in Critical Discourse Studies. As a case study, texts concerning Confucius Institutes on the National Association of Scholars’ official website from 2014 to 2020 were collected to discuss how the threat is constructed discursively and cognitively for an endeavor to influence the public and the political decision-making process. The corpus was further divided into two sub-corpora in order to expose the difference in their cognitive construction of Confucius Institutes. The findings show that the American academia delivers a bottom-up securitizing move by constructing education security discourse on Confucius Institutes in the initial process, yet later the whole-of-society security narratives interacting with a top-down securitizing move from the political agents have been adopted. As indicated by the corpus statistics, the concerned discourses are discursively constructed by following the “Self-Other” dichotomy security narratives, in which Confucius Institutes are cognitively transformed from an academic issue to a national security issue and legitimized through proximization in the spatial, temporal, and axiological dimensions.

"Smart farming is an innovative new approach to traditional agricultural practices that leverages disruptive technologies (DTs) and information and communication technologies (LCT's) to improve efficiency, lower costs, and reduce the wastage of crops and resources. A significant challenge to the widespread implementation of smart farming projects is the lack of knowledge and perceived disadvantages. In this study, sentiment analysis has been performed on YouTube comments to understand user sentiment towards new smart farming technologies. Three text representation techniques, count vectorizer, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF -IDF), and fastText embeddings have been used on a smart farming corpus to analyse user sentiments. Different parametric and non-parametric machine learning algorithms have been used as classifiers on these feature vectors. The results suggest that TF-IDF of unigrams give the best macro-fl score of 0.6616 using a support vector machine-radial basis function (SVM-R) classifier. Visualisations have also been generated using Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP) to provide insight into predictions.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Online speech processing imposes significant computational demands on the listening brain, the underlying mechanisms of which remain poorly understood. Here, we exploit the perceptual ""pop-out"" phenomenon (i.e. the dramatic improvement of speech intelligibility after receiving information about speech content) to investigate the neurophysiological effects of prior expectations on degraded speech comprehension. We recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry from 21 adults while they rated the clarity of noise-vocoded and sine-wave synthesized sentences. Pop-out was reliably elicited following visual presentation of the corresponding written sentence, but not following incongruent or neutral text. Pop-out was associated with improved reconstruction of the acoustic stimulus envelope from low-frequency EEG activity, implying that improvements in perceptual clarity were mediated via top-down signals that enhanced the quality of cortical speech representations. Spectral analysis further revealed that pop-out was accompanied by a reduction in theta-band power, consistent with predictive coding accounts of acoustic filling-in and incremental sentence processing. Moreover, delta-band power, alpha-band power, and pupil diameter were all increased following the provision of any written sentence information, irrespective of content. Together, these findings reveal distinctive profiles of neurophysiological activity that differentiate the content-specific processes associated with degraded speech comprehension from the context-specific processes invoked under adverse listening conditions. © The Author(s) 2022.

"Purpose: Zakat (Islamic almsgiving) plays a considerable role in dealing with the socioeconomic issues in times of COVID-19 pandemic, and such roles have been widely discussed in virtual events. This paper aims to discover knowledge of the current global zakat administration from virtual events of zakat (e.g. webinars) on YouTube and Zoom via text mining approach. Design/methodology/approach: The authors purposefully sampled 12 experts from four different virtual zakat events on YouTube and Zoom. The automated text transcription software is used to pull the information from the sampled videos into text documents. A qualitative analysis is operated using text mining approach via machine learning tool (i.e. Orange Data Mining). Four research questions are developed under the Word Cloud visualisation, hierarchal clustering, topic modelling and graph and network theory. Findings: The machine learning identifies the most important words, the relationship between the experts and their top words and discovers hidden themes from the sample. This finding is practically substantial for zakat stakeholders to understand the current issues of global zakat administration and to learn the applicable lessons from the current issues of zakat management worldwide. Research limitations/implications: This study does not establish a positivist generalisation from the findings because of the nature and objective of the study. Practical implications: A policy implication is drawn pertaining to the legislation of zakat as an Islamic financial policy instrument for combating poverty in Muslim society. Social implications: This work supports the notion of “socioeconomic zakat”, implying that zakat as a religious obligation is important in shaping the social and economic processes of a Muslim community. Originality/values: This work marks the novelty in making sense of the unstructured data from virtual events on YouTube and Zoom in the Islamic social finance research. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Background Falls among older adults will cause a heavy burden on society and families. The development of effective falls prevention intervention policies for community-dwelling older adults is an important initiative to address this global public health problem. Objective To analyze and compare the content composition，key initiatives and implementation strategies of current falls prevention intervention policies for community-dwelling older adults in different countries from the perspective of policy tools. Methods Six countries in Asia，North America，and Europe，including Japan，Singapore，Thailand，the United States，Germany，and Russia，were selected as sample countries according to the degree of population aging and economic income level. Refer to the websites of relevant government departments such as the Ministry of Health，the Center for Disease Control and Prevention and directly affiliated institutions，as well as websites of nongovernmental organizations，such as Prevention of Falls Network Europe，National Council On Aging，U.S.，Association of Fall Prevention，Japan，and National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds，Germany，the national policy documents of prevention interventions for community-dwelling older adults from January 2010 to June 2022 were searched by using ""older adults"" ""fall/drop/accidental injuries"" ""prevention"" as The text analysis was performed from the dimensions of policy tools such as demand-side type，supply-side type and environmental-side type，and injury prevention strategies such as education prevention strategies and evaluation strategies. Results Among the 24 policy documents，there were 212 coded targets in the dimension of policy tools，with environmental-side type，supply-side type and demand-side type policy tools accounting for 45.3%（96/212），40.6%（86/212） and 14.1%（30/212），respectively. Among high-income countries，the public service tools under supply-side type policy tools were mostly applied in the United States and Germany，accounting for 40.5%（17/42） and 13.8%（8/58）；the infrastructure construction tools under supply-side type policy tools were focused in Singapore〔24.1%（7/29）〕. Among low and middle income countries，the environmental-side type policy tools were mostly applied in Russia and Thailand，accounting for 51.3%（20/39） and 55.6%（10/18）, respectively. Public service was mostly applied among the supply-side type policy tools，accounting for 17.5%（37/212）；technical standard was mostly applied among the environmental-side type policy tools，accounting for 10.8%（23/212）；medicare payment was mostly applied among the demand-side type policy tools，accounting for 4.7%（10/212）. In addition，there were 105 coded targets in the dimension of injury prevention strategies，with the education prevention strategies accounting for the highest proportion of 31.4%（33/105），the engineering strategy accounting for the lowest proportion of 5.7%（6/105）. High-income countries are at the stage of multi-sectoral collaborative policy implementation，low and middle income countries are at the stage of policy implementation by the Ministry of Health stage. Conclusion Six countries focus on public service and infrastructure development under supply-side type policy tools；the application of demand-side type policy tools can be summarized as intervention services managed by medical insurance，intervention projects supported by financial funds，service purchases attracted by price subsidies，planning，organization，advocacy，and standard setting of environmental-side type policy tools. In combination with the priorities and specific measures of the six countries，it is suggested to learn from advanced experience in improving public services，strengthening evidence-based projects，standardizing technical standards，supporting financial incentives，expanding medical insurance programs，and providing price subsidies，thus further optimizing falls prevention intervention policies for community-dwelling older adults. © 2023 Chinese General Practice.

"This paper explores the development and implementation of RAFA 2030, an automated classification tool to identify and flag cases related to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in legal disputes before the Brazilian Supreme Court. As the apex judicial institution in Brazil, the court handles a vast array of data in the form of petitions, decisions, injunctions, appeals and other legal documents, primarily in textual format. RAFA 2030, which stands for Artificial Networks with Focus on the 2030 Agenda in Portuguese, utilizes a supervised learning algorithm based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to aid court personnel in categorizing documents according to the SDGs. By incorporating machine learning algorithms for text classification and visual aids such as co-occurrence graphs and word clouds, RAFA 2030 streamlines legal document analysis and enhances information retrieval processes, enabling a strategic focus on socially impactful cases and demonstrating the potential of technology to enhance judicial practice and foster the achievement of the sustainable development goals.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Objective: Test anxiety is one of the common psychological and behavioral problems of college students, which can result in poor academic performance and even academic failure. Aromatherapy has been proposed as a promising method to reduce test anxiety in college students, but its precise efficacy has not been fully confirmed. This meta-analysis evaluated the effects of aromatherapy on the symptoms of test anxiety in college students to serve as a reference for future research and provide more scientific and exact evidence. Methods: PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL, Science Direct, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Journal Full-Text Database (VIP), and Wanfang Data were electronically searched from inception to June 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on aromatherapy for treating students’ test anxiety. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for RCTs was used by two reviewers to critically and independently assess the methodological quality of the included studies. Review Manager 5.4 was used for the meta-analysis. Stata 17.0 was used for sensitivity analysis and Egger’s test. Results: Seven RCTs included 425 patients, with a moderate risk of bias in the included studies. The meta-analysis found that aromatherapy effectively reduced test anxiety in college students (SMD = −0.67, p < 0.01), with high heterogeneity of results (I2 = 72%). The different types of essential oil devices used in the study are the source of inter-study heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis suggested that most effective methods were aromatherapy with compound essential oils (SMD = −0.91, p < 0.01), and using cloths or pads as the essential oil devices (SMD = −1.03, p < 0.01). There was no difference between aromatherapy and placebo control groups (SMD = −0.65, p = 0.25). Conclusion: Aromatherapy with inhalation can help relieve test anxiety in college students, but more and higher-quality studies are needed. This study provides a reference for future research designs in terms of the selection of essential oil types and devices and the design of research groups.

"This study employs social media data associated with Typhoon 'Lekima' as a case study to conduct text sentiment analysis by integrating text classification and sentiment analysis models. The goal is to investigate the patterns of user emotion distribution during the typhoon period. To initiate the process, a character-level Convolutional Neural Network (CharCNN) is utilized to effectively filter out irrelevant text data from Weibo content. Following this, the text content is represented using the word2vec model. Finally, a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model is employed for sentiment analysis, enabling the extraction of emotional features from text sentences. © 2023 IEEE."
"Modality plays an important part in verbal communication, as it can reveal the speaker’s views and perspectives. The modal verb, as an essential component of the modality system, has been a hot research topic and a challenge in academic circles in recent years. Analyzing the modal verbs in a text may indicate the context produced by the translator in the translation and the identity difference between the translator and the reader. In this study, three representative English translations of Shih chi are selected for comparative analysis with the original text. With the help of corpus techniques, the paper investigates the differences in the use of modal verbs by various translators, the distribution of quantitative changes and their influence on translations, as well as the historical and cultural backgrounds and identities of the translators that led to these differences. It is found that owing to the different professional identities of the translators and historical and cultural contexts in which they live, the choice of modal verbs and the shifts of modality values in the three translations are distinct, leading to different translation styles.

"For the analysis of user sentiment in social media networks for the elderly population, emotional sentences are first extracted to classify movie reviews. Afterwards, social network data of the elderly population based on user search behavior is analyzed. The movie reviews of elderly social media users are analyzed for rating prediction. The research results indicate that the accuracy of sentiment classification results is in descending order of Dirichlet, maximum entropy, and support vector machine.

"Introduction: In recent years, software ecosystems have become more complex with the proliferation of distributed systems such as blockchains and distributed ledgers. Effective management of these systems requires constant monitoring to identify any potential malfunctions, anomalies, vulnerabilities, or attacks. Traditional log auditing methods can effectively monitor the health of conventional systems. Yet, they run short of handling the higher levels of complexity of distributed systems. This study aims to propose an innovative architecture for system auditing that can effectively manage the complexity of distributed systems using advanced data analytics, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. Methods: To develop this architecture, we considered the unique characteristics of distributed systems and the various signals that may arise within them. We also felt the need for flexibility to capture these signals effectively. The resulting architecture utilizes advanced data analytics, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence to analyze and interpret the various signals emitted by the system. Results: We have implemented this architecture in the DELTA (Distributed Elastic Log Text Analyzer) auditing tool and applied it to the Hyperledger Fabric platform, a widely used implementation of private blockchains. Discussion: The proposed architecture for system auditing can effectively handle the complexity of distributed systems, and the DELTA tool provides a practical implementation of this approach. Further research could explore this approach's potential applications and effectiveness in other distributed systems. Copyright © 2023 Di Pilla, Pareschi, Salzano and Zappone."
"Theories of scientific and technological change view discovery and invention as endogenous processes1,2, wherein previous accumulated knowledge enables future progress by allowing researchers to, in Newton’s words, ‘stand on the shoulders of giants’3–7. Recent decades have witnessed exponential growth in the volume of new scientific and technological knowledge, thereby creating conditions that should be ripe for major advances8,9. Yet contrary to this view, studies suggest that progress is slowing in several major fields10,11. Here, we analyse these claims at scale across six decades, using data on 45 million papers and 3.9 million patents from six large-scale datasets, together with a new quantitative metric—the CD index12—that characterizes how papers and patents change networks of citations in science and technology. We find that papers and patents are increasingly less likely to break with the past in ways that push science and technology in new directions. This pattern holds universally across fields and is robust across multiple different citation- and text-based metrics1,13–17. Subsequently, we link this decline in disruptiveness to a narrowing in the use of previous knowledge, allowing us to reconcile the patterns we observe with the ‘shoulders of giants’ view. We find that the observed declines are unlikely to be driven by changes in the quality of published science, citation practices or field-specific factors. Overall, our results suggest that slowing rates of disruption may reflect a fundamental shift in the nature of science and technology. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited."
"This paper presents an overview of the third edition of the Automated Legal Question Answering Competition (ALQAC 2023).

"Objective: To present the theoretical-methodological potential of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) for critical studies of Documentary Languages (DL). It starts from Norman Fairclough's CDA assumptions, as well as from the semantic warrants principle to discuss the thematic/discursive representation of social actors. The concepts of ""discourse"", ""social practice"", ""discursive practice"", ""text"", ""power"", ""hegemony"", ""ideology"" and ""semantic warrants"" are used to propose the three-dimensional model of analysis, in which DL would be analyzed in three dimensions: DL as a text, DL as a discursive practice and DL as a social practice. Methods: It uses exploratory and bibliographic research methods, with a qualitative approach. Results: The results indicate that Fairclough's Dialectical-Relational approach provides concepts, tools and categories necessary to work on socio-discursive issues involving the use of language in the representation of documentary content, especially content that involves minorized social groups, such as blacks, indigenous people, women, LGBTQIAP+, among other social groups in vulnerable situations. Conclusions: It is concluded that Fairclough's approach with the use of categories oriented to the senses of words can be operationalized to understand how social actors are being represented in the discourses of DL and how the pattern of inclusion and exclusion of these actors in the process of thematic representation of documents. © 2023, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

"Accurate vehicle rating prediction can facilitate designing and configuring good vehicles. This prediction allows vehicle designers and manufacturers to optimize and improve their designs in a timely manner, enhance their product performance, and effectively attract consumers. However, most of the existing data-driven methods rely on data from a single mode, e.g., text, image, or parametric data, which results in a limited and incomplete exploration of the available information. These methods lack comprehensive analyses and exploration of data from multiple modes, which probably leads to inaccurate conclusions and hinders progress in this field. To overcome this limitation, we propose a multi-modal learning model for more comprehensive and accurate vehicle rating predictions. Specifically, the model simultaneously learns features from the parametric specifications, text descriptions, and images of vehicles to predict five vehicle rating scores, including the total score, critics score, performance score, safety score, and interior score. We compare the multi-modal learning model to the corresponding unimodal models and find that the multi-modal model’s explanatory power is 4% - 12% higher than that of the unimodal models. On this basis, we conduct sensitivity analyses using SHAP to interpret our model and provide design and optimization directions to designers and manufacturers. Our study underscores the importance of the data-driven multi-modal learning approach for vehicle design, evaluation, and optimization.

"In the phenomenology of the natural attitude that Alfred Schütz aims at outlining, taking as his starting point Weber’s verstehende Soziologie and Edmund Husserl’s philosophy, the concept of type plays a central role. This central notion is crucial for understanding the social world and enables a mediation between the heuristic character of Weber’s ideal type and the idealistic character of Husserl’s eidos. Taking his two patron gods as a starting point, Schütz raises the question of the possibility of an analysis of the genesis and functioning of the type that can reveal its constitutive character for experience without getting caught in the web of transcendental idealism. In this article, Type and eidos in Husserl’s late philosophy, the phenomenologist of the social world outlines an examination of the notion of type as a concept that was not thematized by Husserl but operates throughout the development of his thought. The text then analyses the places where this notion operates, particulary in relation to three main themes: the horizontal character of experience and the ante-predictive sphere, the genesis of logical concepts and the regularities that characterize the horizon of the Lebenswelt. Using these three coordinates, Schütz crosses the itinerary of Husserl’s thought, highlighting the limits and the potentialities of a concept that was hardly defined by the phenomenologist, but which proves to be extraordinarily rich. © 2023, Liguori Editore.

"Creative spaces have been the subject of study in recent years. Multiple research studies have demonstrated the positive impact that an accurate workspace design has on increasing worker productivity and well-being. However, there are still many questions about the influence of workspace design on creativity and creative work. This paper aims to provide a review of the state-of-the-art about spatial elements (e.g., tables, chairs, whiteboards, etc.) that influence creative work which is carried out in creative spaces such as offices or learning environments. We conducted a literature search within the Scopus database, and we screened and filtered the returned 2214 sources based on their title and abstract. After that, we identified 34 relevant articles, with which we carry a full-text analysis. From selected articles, we extracted: (i) spatial elements present in creative environments and (ii) how these elements influence creative work. We found that most of the spatial elements provide visual stimuli and inspiration, allow people to build things and capture spontaneous ideas easily, and contribute to the flexible use of the space, encouraging collaboration, privacy, or social encounters. The results provide an overview of the current state of the art of creative spaces topic that can be used by researchers, practitioners, and educators to conduct further research in this field and to take better decisions about spatial element choice.

"Introduction: Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is the mechanism through which organizations integrate the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into their corporate strategies. On the other hand, the communication of responsibility and commitment initiatives with citizens is an important factor in achieving social legitimacy for the company. Moreover, digital communication tools, including corporate podcast, are powerful allies for disseminating a corporate brand message aligned with sustainability, commitment and social responsibility. Therefore, the main objective of this article is to analyze how the banking sector uses corporate podcast as a tool for communicating content related to the SDGs. Methodology: A content analysis of the headlines and explanatory texts of the podcast deliveries issued by the largest financial institutions in Spain during the year 2022 was carried out. Results: 36.1% of the podcasts analyzed address the SDGs, with 12 of the 17 SDGs set by the United Nations being represented. Discussion: The results show a significant use of corporate podcasts as a SDGs communication tool, which is consistent with companies' growing commitment to a more engaged communication linked to CSR. Conclusions: This research represents a further step in understanding how organizations use the communicative possibilities provided by digital platforms, specifically podcasts, to communicate CSR-related issues. © 2023, University of La Laguna.

"Introduction: Improving the quality of diet is known as one of the practical ways to reduce cardio-metabolic risk factors (CMRFs). The carbohydrate quality index (CQI) is a relatively new index to evaluate diet quality. It is calculated based on the ratio of solid carbohydrates to total carbohydrates, dietary fibre intake, glycemic index and the ratio of whole grains to total grains. This systematic review and meta-analysis was designed to investigate the association between dietary CQI and CMRFs. Methods: In this systematic review, some international databases, including Scopus, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to July 2022, were searched according to appropriate keywords. All observational studies with an English full text assessing the association between the dietary CQI and CMRFs were included. Two researchers independently extracted the data and assessed the quality of the articles with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Random/fixed-effect meta-analysis was used to pool standardized mean difference (SMD) as an effect size. Results: 11 studies with a total of 63962 subjects were found to be eligible and included in the qualitative synthesis; only BMI, WC and metabolic syndrome reached the threshold of 3 reports with the same effect size and thus only 5 were included in the meta-analysis. The main finding of the included studies was that there were inverse associations between CQI and CMRFs, mainly obesity, glucose metabolism indices, and blood pressure. In the five studies included in the random effect meta-analysis, the association between CQI and body mass index (SMD: 0.45, 95%CI: -0.12, 1.01), waist circumference (SMD: -0.09, 95%CI: -0.34, 0.15) and metabolic syndrome (SMD: 0.63, 95%CI: -0.01, 1.28) was not statistically significant. Conclusion: Although the qualitative findings support the positive association of CQI with CMRFs, the evidence is insufficient to conclude robust findings. Further observational and interventional studies are needed to clearly elucidate this association. © 2023 Hogrefe AG."
"In this paper, we inquire into possible definitions for digital literatures in the broader context of technopoetics (Kozak, 2022). To this end, we recover Espen Aarseth's notion of text as machine (1997) and reflect on the modes of being of this type of literatures in the domain of cybernetic textualities. Based on the analysis of nopos3as1miedo (2020) by Matías Buonfrate and Códigos (2015) by Milton Läufer, we wonder about the tools and contexts of this type of productions when it comes to linking with the immense amounts of circulating linguistic materials that characterize the digital universe. We also question the political potency of these practices in a context of cybernetic production of signs. © 2023 Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata. All rights reserved."
"Search engines are tools used to find information on the Internet. Since the web has a plethora of websites, the engine queries the majority of active sites and builds a database organized according to keywords utilized in the search. Because of this, when a user types a few descriptive words on the home page of the search engine, the search function lists websites corresponding to these keywords. However, there are some problems with this search approach. For instance, if a user wants information about the word Jaguar, most search results are animals and cars. This is a polysemic problem that forces search engines to always provide the most popular but not the most relevant results. This article presents a study of using sentiment technology to help news classification and categorization and improve the classification accuracy. We have introduced a smart search function embedded into a search engine to tackle polysemic issues and record relevant results to determine their sentimentality. Therefore, this study presents a topic that involves several aspects of natural language processing (NLP) and sentiment analysis for news categorization and classification. A web crawler was used to collect British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) news across the Internet, carried out preprocessing of text by using NLP, and applied sentiment analysis methods to determine the polarity of the processed text data. The sentimentality represents negative, positive, or neutral polarities assigned by the sentiment analysis algorithms. The research utilized the BBC news site to collect different information using a web crawler and a database to explore the sentimentality of BBC news. The natural language toolkit (NLTK) and BM25 indexed and preprocessed patterns in the database. The experimental results depict the proposed search function surpassing normal search with an accuracy rate of 85%. Moreover, the results show a negative polarity of BBC news using the Sentistrength algorithm. Furthermore, the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) was the best-performing sentiment analysis model for news classification. This model obtained an accuracy of 85% using data collected with the proposed smart function.  © 2023 Mike Nkongolo Wa Nkongolo."
"User-generated content (UGC) provides us with a rich channel to aggregate public information. The study examines whether UGC could predict the failure of P2P lending platforms, which also depends on crowds’ involvement and contribution. Specifically, we examine a web forum with user comments on the P2P platforms and extract consumer opinion valence and opinion concentration with natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Time-dependent Cox regression analysis shows that consumer opinion has a strong prediction power for platform survival. If consumer opinions on a platform are positive and concentrated, a platform is more likely to survive. Besides, the two factors show a substitution effect to each other. This study deepens our understanding of UGC, which has significant implications for research. It also forms an application of information technology on risk assessment, by expanding the risk indicators to UGC-related information sources. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"One of the most appealing multidisciplinary research areas in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is Sentiment Analysis (SA). Due to the intricate and complementary interactions between several modalities, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) is an extremely difficult work that has a wide range of applications. In the subject of multimodal sentiment analysis, numerous deep learning models and different techniques have been suggested, but they do not investigate the explicit context of words and are unable to model diverse components of a sentence. Hence, the full potential of such diverse data has not been explored. In this research, a Context-Sensitive Multi-Tier Deep Learning Framework (CS-MDF) is proposed for sentiment analysis on multimodal data. The CS-MDF uses a three-tier architecture for extracting context-sensitive information. The first tier utilizes Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting text-based features, 3D-CNN model for extracting visual features and open-Source Media Interpretation by Large feature-space Extraction (openSMILE) tool kit for audio feature extraction.The first tier focuses on extracting the unimodal features from the utterances. This level of extraction ignores context-sensitive data while determining the feature.CNNs are suitable for text data because they are particularly useful for identifying local patterns and dependencies in data.The second tier uses the features extracted from the first tier.The context-sensitive unimodal characteristics are extracted in this tier using the Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which is used to comprehend inter-utterance links and uncover contextual evidence.The output from tier two is combined and passed to the third tier, which fuses the features from different modalities and trains a single BiGRU model that provides the final classification.This method applies the BiGRU model to sequential data processing, using the advantages of both modalities and capturing their interdependencies.Experimental results obtained on six real-life datasets (Flickr Images dataset, Multi-View Sentiment Analysis dataset, Getty Images dataset, Balanced Twitter for Sentiment Analysis dataset, CMU-MOSI Dataset) show that the proposed CS-MDF model has achieved better performance compared with ten state-of-the-art approaches, which are validated by F1 score, precision, accuracy, and recall metrics.An ablation study is carried out on the proposed framework that demonstrates the viability of the design. The GradCAM visualization technique is applied to visualize the aligned input image-text pairs learned by the proposed CS-MDF model. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Inferring geographic locations via social posts is essential for many practical location-based applications such as product marketing, point-of-interest recommendation, and infector tracking for COVID-19. Unlike image-based location retrieval or social-post text embedding-based location inference, the combined effect of multi-modal information (i.e., post images, text, and hashtags) for social post positioning receives less attention. In this work, we collect real datasets of social posts with images, texts, and hashtags from Instagram and propose a novel Multi-modal Representation Learning Framework (MRLF) capable of fusing different modalities of social posts for location inference. MRLF integrates a multi-head attention mechanism to enhance location-salient information extraction while significantly improving location inference compared with single domain-based methods. To overcome the noisy user-generated textual content, we introduce a novel attention-based character-aware module that considers the relative dependencies between characters of social post texts and hashtags for flexible multi-model information fusion. The experimental results show that MRLF can make accurate location predictions and open a new door to understanding the multi-modal data of social posts for online inference tasks.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Mental health issues are detrimental to quality of life and frequently increase the dangers of mental disease like suicidal thoughts, depression, and many are frequently misdiagnosed and remain untreated. Accurate diagnosis of indicators of mental health disorders is especially crucial because they may be life-threatening when left untreated. Therefore, it is essential to have a thorough understanding of the sources to recognize a person’s mental illness. Social media is the major source of identifying individual mental diseases, and hence their needs a sophisticated analysis from several angles to prevent death. On the other hand, researchers are examining whether computer methods could track the communication on social networks, which might help in the early identification of mental health issues. This paper creates a new system for analyzing mental health disorders via social media data that avoids the problem from becoming serious. Preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification are the three steps of this approach. First, stemming and stop word removal will be processed as the preprocessing step of input text. From the preprocessed text, Improved Semantic Similarity features, content features, BoVW, features like n-grams, LIWC features, and are extracted. The ensemble classifier, which includes the classifiers from the Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU), Deep Maxout, and Improved Convolution Neural Network (ICNN), performs a categorization using the extracted characteristics. Also, to improve the efficiency of classification, a training model is introduced in the ICNN termed as self-adaptive Shuffled shepherd optimization method (SASSOA) that tunes the optimal weights. Finally, the efficacy of the projected method is verified to the convolutional procedures. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Tirant lo Blanch, the novel by Joanot Martorell, and Juan Quinquín en Pueblo Mocho, by Samuel Feijóo, are texts that share several isotopies. However, their characters behave in asymptotic ways with respect to epochal social conventions. Taking literary theory and rhetoric as models of analysis, we present a rereading of the concept of myth of the knight and the actions that allow the emergence of mythopoetic or resemanticizing attitudes, as well as their interaction with the autopoiesis of the complex literary system. Love behaves in both novels as the reticular structure that organizes and configures the actions of the literary subjects. Finally, it is concluded that Tirante is a split and borderline subject between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, who violates to a certain extent the virtues that knights must fulfill; and that Juan Quinquín, distant in time from the order of chivalry, tries to behave as if he were a knight-errant. Both characters err when they must perform the operation of mythologizing/resemanticizing and that failure leads them to failure in autopoiesis. © 2023 Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata.

"Images are one of the critical forms of expression in the introduction of financing projects on crowdfunding platforms. As the existing researches on the impact of image factors on crowdfunding project financing outcomes were limited, the influence of image cues on fundraising effectiveness was analyzed from the perspective of image semantic hierarchy. Image clues were extracted from the visual layer, object layer and concept layer dimensions, and their impact on crowdfunding project financing outcomes was analyzed based on the media richness theory. The moderating effect of project type on this relationship was also analyzed. Through empirical experiments, 6,336 crowdfunding projects on the Kickstarter platform were examined. The results show that image cues such as product images, team member portraits, the size of character images, and facial expressions can significantly improve the fundraising success rate of crowdfunding projects. Compared with technology, game, and food projects, the financing effects of publishing projects are more significantly affected by image cues. This study can help guide fundraisers of crowdfunding projects to use multiple media such as images and text to create attractive project presentations to improve the success rate of fundraising. © 2023 Shanghai Institute of Mechanical Engineering.

"Social relations and social networks are at the core of society. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is an emerging field that examines these networks and their structures. In this article, we will apply methods from SNA to a narrative text in the book of Genesis and analyse the social structure in the story of Jacob. In particular, we will discuss how closely connected narrative exegesis and SNA are and how this helps to understand the social dynamics described in the text. We will also discuss the limitations of this method within Old Testament studies. Soziale Beziehungen und soziale Netzwerke sind das Herzstück der Gesellschaft.

"Objective: to map the expressions of ageism directed to older adults in health services and the respective coping measures. Method: a scoping review of primary studies in English, Spanish and Portuguese, without time delimitation and collected from 14 databases. Selection of the titles, abstracts and full text was in charge of two independent and blinded reviewers, totaling a corpus comprised by 41 articles. Data extraction was performed by pairs. The data were presented in narrative summaries and charts. Results: the ageism expressions are understood at the interpersonal level through images and attitudes that depreciate, devalue life and delegitimize older adults’ needs, as well as at the institutional level, which confers barriers to accessing health services, generating non-assistance and neglect. The coping measures consist of educational interventions and expansion of communication channels between aged people, health professionals and managers. Conclusion: the results may make health professionals vigilant for care/neglect guided by age bias and sensitive for coping with ageism by obtaining diverse scientific knowledge. The analysis of the phenomenon in the Unified Health System context constitutes a knowledge gap, as well as the implicit ageism expressions. © 2023 Revista Latino-Americana de Enfermagem."
"There exists a relationship of phytonyms in the Kazakh language with the content of the Kazakh mythical texts. This study attempted to examine mytho-phytonyms as carriers of information about the worldview of the Kazakh people. In the course of this qualitative study, the data was collected though documentation search. The mytho-phytonyms like karagai (pine), sekseuil (saksaul) and similar other ""sacred equivalents"" within the framework of mythological texts were examined, which expressed the cognitive attitude of the ethnos to the environment and to religion. During the analysis of the data, the information about the myths related to the phytonyms karagai and sekseuil was correlated with the external features, biological characteristics of plants, and their role in the genres of folklore and literature was determined. The novelty of the research lies in the fact that phytonyms are considered for the first time in the mythological aspect. As a result of this research, images of pine and saksaul are established clearly in the minds of the Kazakh people, and the breadth of the intertext field of mythical texts has been determined. The implications of this study relate significantly to the relationship between language, culture, and mythology and further research on mytho-phytonyms and the creation of a dictionary of mytho-phytonyms of the Kazakh nation. © 2023 EJAL & the Authors."
"Hate speech detection research is a recent sizzling topic in natural language processing (NLP). Unburdened uses of social media platforms make people over-opinionative, which crosses the limit of leaving comments and posts toxic. A toxic outlook increases violence towards the neighbour, state, country, and continent. Several laws have been introduced in different countries to end the emergency problem. Now, all the media platforms have started working on restricting hate posts or comments. Hate speech detection is generally a text classification problem if considered a supervised observation. To tackle text in terms of computation perspective is challenging because of its semantic and complex grammatical nature. Resource-rich languages leverage their richness, whereas resource scarce language suffers significantly from a lack of dataset. This paper makes a multifaceted contribution encompassing resource generation, experimentation with Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL) and state-of-the-art transformer-based models, and a comprehensive evaluation of model performance, including thorough error analysis. In the realm of resource generation, it adds to the North-East Indian Hate Speech tagged dataset (NEIHS version 1), which encompasses two languages: Assamese and Bodo © 2023 SCPE.

"Introduction: In academic written texts, linguistic and rhetorical features are often interactively used as a vehicle for writers to construct their texts in order to accomplish specific communicative purposes. However, the effective integration of these resources may pose challenges for developing writers. Purpose: This study employed a corpus-based genre analysis approach to investigate phrasal complexity features and rhetorical functions in data commentaries written by Iranian undergraduate and graduate students. Through this approach, we aimed to examine a relatively unexplored genre of data commentary in terms of its phrasal complexity features, rhetorical functions, and their relationships. By analyzing these relationships, we sought to provide insights into the writing practices of Iranian undergraduate and graduate students in the context of data commentaries. Method: This study employed a convenient sampling method to select a total of 76 university students, which included 47 undergraduate students and 29 graduate students. The participants were involved in generating a corpus of 380 data commentaries, which were then thoroughly examined and compared. To identify instances of phrasal complexity features, the researchers utilized the AntConc software tool, applying regular expressions (regex) to extract potential occurrences. Additionally, a Python program was developed and implemented to calculate the frequencies of the identified PCFs. The researchers manually annotated the rhetorical function of the data commentaries to determine their specific usage. Results: Statistical analysis such as Mann Whitney U test and Spearman correlation test, revealed that graduate students significantly utilized more phrasal complexity features including attributive adjectives, nominalizations, and prepositional phrases (of) compared to undergraduate students. However, a qualitative analysis showed that the use of these linguistic features is influenced by the writing topics. Regarding rhetorical functions, graduate students used more moves and/or steps related to presenting and commenting data, while undergraduate students produced more moves or steps concerning personal asides. Moreover, certain phrasal complexity features and the moves and/or steps were found to be correlated, aligning with recent corpus-based studies. Conclusion: The study concludes with pedagogical implications. © 2023 National Research University Higher School of Economics. All rights reserved."
"This study examined which aspects of critical literacy are focused on in the reading literacy assessment for the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 and what kinds of texts are related to the critical literacy items in the test. Based on theory-oriented qualitative content analysis, critical literacy items in PISA represented, for example, determining the purpose of a text or separating fact and opinion. Most of the items were related to genre approaches to critical literacy, yet they ignored social justice aspects. Furthermore, the test consisted mostly of informational texts and only a few fictional texts. The findings indicate a need to develop a more comprehensive critical literacy assessment tool. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Emotion identification from text can help boost the effectiveness of sentiment analysis models. Sarcasm is one of the more difficult emotions to detect, particularly in textual data. Even though several models for detecting sarcasm have been presented, their performance falls way short of that of other emotion detection models. As a result, few strategies have been introduced in the paper that helped to enhance the performance of sarcasm detection models. To compare performance, the model was tested using the TweetEval benchmark dataset. On the TweetEval benchmark, the technique proposed in this paper has established a new state-of-the-art. Besides the low performance, interpretability of existing sarcasm detection models are lacking compared to other emotion detection models like hate speech and anger. Therefore, an attention-based interpretability technique has been proposed in this paper that interprets the token importance for a certain decision of sarcasm detection model. The results of the interpretability technique aid in our comprehension of the contextual embeddings of the input tokens that the model has paid the greatest attention to while making a particular decision which outperforms existing transformer-based interpretability techniques, particularly in terms of visualisations. © (2023), (West University of Timisoara).

"Computers and the Internet have changed people’s lifestyles, and the number of Internet users increases with the progress of Internet technology. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model for consumer behavior research and taking Coca-Cola’s official fan club as an example, this study constructed independent variables, including message usefulness and message playfulness, and anticipated users’ willingness to forward the messages and whether such willingness would be affected by how these messages are presented. This study conducted a questionnaire survey among 365 Facebook users and used regression analysis and two-way ANOVA to examine the related hypotheses. The findings are as follows: (1) Message usefulness has a positive correlation with message forwarding intention on Facebook. (2) Message playfulness has a positive correlation with message forwarding intention. (3) With high message practicality and interest, text added to audio and video has a more significant impact on the willingness to reproduce the message than other presentation methods. © 2023 Academy of Taiwan Information Systems Research.

"This study analyzed users' emotional responses to VI character design through YouTube comments. The researchers applied text-mining to analyze 116,375 comments, focusing on terms related to character design and characteristics of VI. Using the BERT model in sentiment analysis, we classified comments into extremely negative, negative, neutral, positive, or extremely positive sentiments. Next, we conducted a co-occurrence frequency analysis on comments with extremely negative and extremely positive responses to examine the semantic relationships between character design and emotional characteristic terms. We also performed a content analysis of comments about Miquela and Shudu to analyze the perception differences regarding the two character designs. The results indicate that form elements (e.g., voice, face, and skin) and behavioral elements (e.g., speaking, interviewing, and reacting) are vital in eliciting users' emotional responses. Notably, in the negative responses, users focused on the humanization aspect of voice and the authenticity aspect of behavior in speaking, interviewing, and reacting. Furthermore, we found differences in the character design elements and characteristics that users expect based on the VI's field of activity. As a result, this study suggests applications to character design to accommodate these variations. © 2023, The Korean Society of Clothing and Textiles. All rights reserved."
"This essay examines the topic of sexual violence in Middle Dutch literature, centring on the play ‘Lanseloet van Denemerken’ (c.1405). Although medieval literature is known for its gender-based violence, the topic has not received much attention from scholars of Middle Dutch. This article aims to renew the scholarly debate by analysing the Middle Dutch text from an innovative intersectional perspective, integrating the analytical categories of gender, social status and narrative space and adopting those categories for literary studies. This analysis uncovers new meanings in the play and demonstrates that gender, status and space work together in creating an unsafe situation, in which the female protagonist Sanderijn is raped by the male protagonist Lanseloet. Subsequently, this article analyses recent scholarly publications on ‘Lanseloet van Denemerken’ to investigate how scholars in Middle Dutch literature are handling the sensitive topic of rape. It is demonstrated that our interpretations and discussions of the medieval text run the risk of being involuntarily influenced by present-day rape myths–false beliefs and attitudes about sexual violence that prevail in our current culture. Therefore, this article calls on researchers’ shared responsibility to ensure a continuous and open discussion of sensitive topics in the field of Middle Dutch literary studies. © 2023 The Author(s).

"The European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) is updating the Guidelines on Food Allergy Diagnosis. We aimed to undertake a systematic review of the literature with meta-analyses to assess the accuracy of diagnostic tests for IgE-mediated food allergy. We searched three databases (Cochrane CENTRAL (Trials), MEDLINE (OVID) and Embase (OVID)) for diagnostic test accuracy studies published between 1 October 2012 and 30 June 2021 according to a previously published protocol (CRD42021259186). We independently screened abstracts, extracted data from full texts and assessed risk of bias with QUADRAS 2 tool in duplicate. Meta-analyses were undertaken for food-test combinations for which three or more studies were available. A total of 149 studies comprising 24,489 patients met the inclusion criteria and they were generally heterogeneous. 60.4% of studies were in children ≤12 years of age, 54.3% were undertaken in Europe, ≥95% were conducted in a specialized paediatric or allergy clinical setting and all included oral food challenge in at least a percentage of enrolled patients, in 21.5% double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges. Skin prick test (SPT) with fresh cow's milk and raw egg had high sensitivity (90% and 94%) for milk and cooked egg allergies. Specific IgE (sIgE) to individual components had high specificity: Ara h 2-sIgE had 92%, Cor a 14-sIgE 95%, Ana o 3-sIgE 94%, casein-sIgE 93%, ovomucoid-sIgE 92/91% for the diagnosis of peanut, hazelnut, cashew, cow's milk and raw/cooked egg allergies, respectively. The basophil activation test (BAT) was highly specific for the diagnosis of peanut (90%) and sesame (93%) allergies. In conclusion, SPT and specific IgE to extracts had high sensitivity whereas specific IgE to components and BAT had high specificity to support the diagnosis of individual food allergies. © 2023 The Authors.

"One of the challenges in introducing automated service vehicles (ASVs) to parking areas is guiding pedestrians to make quick and appropriate crossing decisions based on an understanding of what the ASV typically does. This study aims to find effective communication strategies for ASVs for pedestrian crossings in Japanese parking areas. Virtual Reality experiments were conducted with 40 participants facilitating vehicle behavior (Normal Deceleration, Early Deceleration, Early Stop) and text-based external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs; No eHMI, “After you,” “I’ll stop,” “In Automated Driving”) as tools of communication with two types of ASVs (bus and golf cart) in parking areas. The results indicated that vehicle behavior significantly influenced pedestrian crossing decisions, and pedestrians began to cross when the ASV decelerated early and stopped not too far from them (Early Deceleration). Self-reported measure analyses revealed that text messages containing the intent of the ASV's actions or instruction (After you, I’ll stop) with Early Deceleration would probably lead to pedestrians’ favorable attitudes toward automated buses. These findings contribute to communication designs based on implicit communication for pedestrian crossing decision-making in parking areas with a clear interpretation of ASV’s intentions. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Mobile applications for weight loss have arisen the interest of private companies and developers, who have put great efforts on the development of this kind of apps. This topic has attracted the interest of the scientific community, both in terms of usability and design. Two main issues have, however, arisen: firstly, research focus has been on the apps themselves, but little attention has been paid to how they are presented in the application stores, and secondly, current literature focuses solely on applications in English. The study objective is to observe how the most popular weight loss applications for the Spanish market are presented in the stores. Using thematic analysis, this study is aimed at discovering the themes featured in the store descriptions and to observe what functionalities are highlighted in these descriptions. The initial sample was based on 247 weight loss applications, which after revision was reduced to 7 applications. Our results show that they focused on efficacy, speed, and, to a much lesser degree, safety in weight loss. Among the main results, we found that app descriptors analyzed did not employ a scientific language and demonstrate technical expertise, or user testimonials. On the other hand, the claims made by the apps about weight loss were mainly based on effectiveness. This sometimes included the concept of quick results and, to a lesser extent, health and safety. Lastly, we observed that there is room for improvement in the linguistic and cultural adaptation of the texts of these application descriptions. Regarding the study limitations, the reduced number of the sample is because our study focuses on applications with features that follow international weight loss guidelines, which most of them did not follow.  © 2023 Lara Martin-Vicario et al."
"Cardio-oncology is a dynamic field. Research has suggested that cancer itself can damage the heart, independent of cancer treatment-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD). The aim of this study was to establish the nature of cardiovascular abnormalities reported in cancer, excluding CTRCD. Scoping review search included cardiovascular abnormalities in adults with solid tumour malignancies, and excluded CTRCD and thrombotic events. Three databases (CINAHL, Embase, Medline) were searched, supplemented by a handsearch. All screening and data extraction was done by two researchers with consensus reached for any conflicts. Given the heterogeneous nature of the studies identified, data synthesis was narrative. The search identified 42 366 studies. Following deduplication and title/abstract screening, 195 studies were assessed for full-text eligibility. Forty-four studies are included in the final analysis. There are 19 prospective observational studies, 13 retrospective studies, 9 case reports and 3 cross-sectional studies. Types of abnormality identified include cardiomyopathy (16, including Takotsubo (9)), autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction (10), biomarker disturbances (9), reduced myocardial strain (6) and others (3). Due to variable study design, the prevalence was not determined. Cardiovascular abnormalities were associated with morbidity (chest pain, dyspnoea, fatigue) and shortened prognosis. In conclusion: (1) There is evidence for cardiovascular dysfunction in patients with solid tumour malignancies, distinct from CTRCD. People with solid tumours have higher rates of cardiac disease, even when newly diagnosed and treatment naïve. (2) Abnormalities manifest mainly as cardiomyopathies, ANS dysfunction and raised biomarker levels and are associated with significant symptoms. (3) Treatment plans need to take account of these risks, and widen criteria for screening. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

"The article proposes a discussion on the role of images in different psychological theories from a reading of the novel The Days of Abandonment, by Elena Ferrante. The mythical and mundane aspects of the figure of the “poor thing” [la poverella] as it appears in the text are approached in their ambivalence, considering both the pertinence of a classical psychoanalytic approach and the adequacy of C. G. Jung’s theory of archetypes to understand the phenomenon in the context of the narrative. The article then projects the archetypal psychology of James Hillman, Patricia Berry, and Rafael López-Pedraza as the most appropriate theoretical reference for the analysis, recognizing transpersonal dimension of the image, but without submitting it to a structuralist interpretation. © 2023 Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro.

"An isolated branch of the tradition of Notker the Stammerer’s Gesta Karoli contains the account of a peculiar miracle of the martyr saint Pancras, connected to the events that led to the coronation of Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor at the hands of Pope Leo III. This branch of the Gesta conveys an alternative version of the text, which, albeit spurious, includes some additional passages characterized by elements that seemingly derive from its context of origin. The aim of the article is to identify, through the philological analysis of these excerpts, a number of hints that might help determine the place and date of composition of this redaction and of the miracle-tale therein contained, in order to better understand the relationship between the sources concerning the specific function ascribed to saint Pancras in the text – that is, the ability to identify and punish perjuries. © SISMEL-Edizioni del Galluzzo 2023."
"The aim of this article was to present the possibilities offered by the ordoliberal theory that predispose it to determine a socio-economic order which makes it possible to tackle the dysfunctions and crises that afflict today’s economy and all human civilisation, especially in the ecological dimension. The analysis is based on critical study of the professional literature on the subject in question, which includes both publications on ordoliberal thought and texts which identify the threats present in the modern world. The ordoliberal theory of economic governance shows the potential for its development to include environmental issues, as well as its application as an intellectual basis for socio-economic policies capable of helping to solve contemporary problems. This article represents one of the first attempts to complement the ordoliberal theory of economic order and the concept of the Social Market Economy with ecological aspects. © 2023 Piotr Pysz, Anna E.

"Pointing out the significance of Pushkin's cycle The Tales of the Late Ivan Petrovich Belkin (1831) in the context of Croatian Romanticism, the paper focuses on the story ""Blizzard"", which critics have recognized as an intertext of the novellas ""One Night"" (1846) by Dimitrĳe Demeter and ""Glory and Love"" (1853) by Mirko Bogović. In the analysis of Pushkin's ""The Blizzard"", the author starts from a psychoanalytical reading of Kierkegaard's study Either/Or, which brings to light the analogy between the unattainable object of desire and the object of literature. Contending that irony is the formative principle of Kierkegaard's and Pushkin's texts, the paper highlights their abysmal structure, showing that absence in the place of first and true love is identical to absence in the place of the first and true story. © 2023, Croatian Philological Society.

"The growing awareness towards literary tourism has given it a gradual popularity, strengthening its role in the tourist offer in Portugal. Aware of this fact, we discuss, in this paper, the main initiatives of literary festivals in the country in the city of Penafiel. Experiences, images, and texts are increasingly important to achieve tourist realities. And it is through literary festivals that they are enhanced. Although event tourism has an increasingly interdisciplinary approach, the analysis of the literary experience is still scarce. The main goal of this article is to understand the experience provided by the literary festival ESCRITARIA which took place in 2022, holding its 15th edition. Therefore, a thorough literature review was done, as well as an exploratory and quantitative investigation. In addition, a data collection was carried out with a questionnaire designed to be answered online by the national and international participants in Escritaria. To understand Escritaria as a literary event proposal, one surveyed a sample of national and foreign participants in the festival; since it took place during the event, it allowed one to gauge the importance of literary events as an enhancing offer of the tourist activity. Starting from the sociodemographic profile of the participants, this study aims to understand the forms of participation, involvement and satisfaction. The results of the analysis highlight the growing importance of this type of events and this one, in particular, a festival that has been building loyalty and expanding its audience, an audience of national and international scope. This festival not only increases the number of tourists/visitors, but also enhances the destination promotion and marketing activities. © the authors, 2023. All Rights Reserved."
"This paper raises an uncommon question: What can studying Thomas Aquinas and Critical Race Theory teach us about failures to promote mercy across the color-line? I answer this question in five stages. After locating Thomas’s teachings on mercy and its impediments within his masterwork, the Summa theologiae, I excavate Thomas’s account of mercy’s impediments. Next, I address the question “What is CRT?” Then I examine a foundational CRT text’s analysis of mercy’s impediments. Lastly, I offer a proposal for further Thomas-CRT collaborations. © 2023 by Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia. All rights reserved."
"This study examines the evolving information environment in a sample of post-IPO firms from 2010 to 2020 by exploring the relationship between firm-level manager sentiments and excess buy-and-hold stock returns. We confirm that there is a negative relationship between the full-text manager sentiment and the long-term excess buy-and-hold returns from 1 to 12 months after corporate filings. However, there is no positive association between manager sentiment and contemporaneous (e.g., 4-day) event-window announcement returns as documented in prior studies. The mispricing effect captured by the firm-level manager sentiment is less severe in the later years post IPOs, indicating the degree of information asymmetry is a dynamic phenomenon as the firms become more established over time. We also find the manager sentiment from the section of Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is less optimistic about the firm performance than the full-text manager sentiment, and there is no mispricing effect of the MD&A manager sentiment on stock returns. These findings shed valuable insights on the dynamic information environment in the post-IPO firms from a unique perspective. © 2023, Academy of Economics and Finance."
"This paper provides a contrastive analysis of COVID-19-related EU legislative texts with emphasis on term variants. The analysis carried out on a parallel corpus consisting of English and Croatian texts has identified multiple examples of variation of predominately multi-word terms at several levels. These include orthographic and grammatical variants, unit shifts and denominative variants creating different meanings. The findings support other contemporary studies into variation within specialized language, highlighting the importance of studying variation to gain understanding about the dynamics of domain knowledge. By focusing on variation in a parallel corpus, conclusions are drawn about the prevalence of variation in a newer EU official language, as opposed to English as the draft text of EU legislation. © 2023, Institute of Croatian Language and Linguistics.

"Background: The Draft Mental Health Bill proposes removal of both intellectual disability and autism from Section 3 of the Mental Health Act for England and Wales (MHA). This would lead to people with intellectual disability (PwID) and/or autism could not be detained beyond 28 days, in the absence of diagnosed co-occurring mental illness. Aim: To obtain views of psychiatrists working with PwID in England and Wales regarding the proposed MHA changes. This study focusses specifically on the impact on PwID. Methods: A cross-sectional online mixed methodology survey of Likert and free-text response questions was developed, to ascertain perceptions of proposed legislative changes to the MHA. A non-discriminatory exponential snowballing technique leading to non-probability sampling was used to disseminate the survey. Quantitative data was analysed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney and Fisher’s exact tests. Thematic analysis was conducted on free text responses. Results: A total of 82 psychiatrists (33%) from approximately 250 eligible completed the survey. Nearly two-thirds (64%) reported good awareness of the proposed changes, with over half (55%) reporting disagreement with the changes. Psychiatrists working in inpatient settings for PwID reported increased awareness of the changes, less agreement with the reforms, and increased expectations of the reforms having negative unintended consequences, compared to their peers working exclusively in the community. Consultants reported greater disagreement with the changes compared to their non-consultant peers. Qualitative analysis identified five main themes: impact on diagnosis and treatment, seeking alternative options, introducing inequities, resources, and meeting holistic care goals through the Care, Education and Treatment Reviews (CETR) process. Conclusion: Psychiatrists working with PwID report widespread disagreement with the proposed changes to the MHA for PwID, with greater levels of disagreement among those working in inpatient services. Caution with respect to the proposed changes, and monitoring of the impact of the changes if implemented, is advised. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Scholarly enquiries into federalism have paid insufficient attention to the role of local governments in the constitutional orders of jurisdictions in the global south. However, it is precisely in the “new world” constitutional orders in Asia, Latin America and Africa which are witnessing “constitutional innovations” for local governance. With the passing of the 73rd and 74th Amendments, the Constitution of India now integrates rural and urban local governments as “institutions of self-government” within India’s state architecture. However, despite constitutional entrenchment, local governments in India are often weak and have limited autonomy in executing functions vested in them. This paper examines the role, status, and power of local governments in India’s federal constitutional scheme and their relationship with state and federal governments. It critically analyses the nature of authority the Constitution of India vests on local governments, and how these have been translated by state governments, interpreted by courts, and exercised in practice. The paper explores the underlying legal and political reasons behind the wide gulf between the de jure and de facto powers of local governments, especially in cities, in India. For a situated understanding of the inter-governmental relations of local governments with higher levels of government, this paper focuses on the division of powers in the governance of public health, especially in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic. Public health is a particularly interesting lens to understand inter-governmental relations since the legislative and executive authority for governing public health is split between different levels of government. Though in India’s constitutional scheme, state and local governments are the primary authorities vested with the management of healthcare, the federal government invoked the Disaster Management Act, 2005 for the imposition of a national lockdown. The judicial review of pandemic-related governance has also had a significant impact on inter-governmental relations that has altered the vaccination strategy of the federal government. Through a close analysis of the constitutional text, judicial interpretation and political context determining local government power, specifically in the context of governing public health, this paper seeks to elucidate the role of local governments in Indian federalism. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Reflecting from the lived experience, being this a vehicle for the construction of knowledge, has been fundamental to carry out this text.

"Plastic bearings have a wide range of industrial applications due to their many desirable properties such as lightweight, low friction coefficient, chemical resistance, and ability to operate without lubrication. Timely bearing fault diagnosis can prevent equipment failure and costly downtime. In recent years, developing machine learning based bearing fault diagnosis with few labelled data has attracted a lot of attention as datasets with fault labels are rare in many industrial applications. One effective approach to meet the challenge is few-shot learning. Among many approaches, utilizing a good pre-trained deep learning model to achieve few-shot learning is an effective and efficient alternative. In this paper, a pre-trained deep learning model called CLIP that combines image processing and natural language processing (NLP) is adopted to few-shot learning for plastic bearing fault diagnosis. We explore the feasibility of leveraging CLIP model in the realm of bearing fault diagnosis via few-shot learning. Specifically, we tackle the challenges posed by CLIP's creation of requisite text prompt embeddings for the diagnosis of mechanical faults, within a few-shot learning framework. Our investigation illuminates the remarkable capability of CLIP to adapt to new tasks with minimal examples, a feature we exploit to devise a solution for plastic bearing fault diagnosis. The effectiveness of the few-shot learning method with CLIP is demonstrated using vibration data collected from plastic bearing seeded fault tests in the laboratory. © 2023 Prognostics and Health Management Society.

"Analysis of Consumer buying patterns is crucial for vendors to understand the necessities and favorites of their audience. With the increasing availability of digital data, collecting large amounts of consumer feedback and opinions has become easier. However, analyzing such data is challenging due to the presence of unstructured text data. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a prevalent topic modeling procedure that can be used to analyze unstructured text data. LDA allows for the identification of latent topics that are present in the data, enabling businesses to gain insights into consumer behavior. By applying LDA to consumer feedback data, businesses can identify the key topics that are most important to their customers. Additionally, LDA can be used to track changes in consumer preferences over time, allowing businesses to stay up-to-date with evolving market trends. Overall, LDA is a powerful tool for analyzing consumer behavior and can provide valuable insights for businesses looking to improve their products and services. In this work, LDA is employed to analyze consumer tweets using topic modeling. LDA has successfully generated topic and © 2023 IEEE."
"Nowadays, social networks play a fundamental role in promoting and diffusing television and radio programs to different categories of audiences. So, political parties, influential groups and political activists have rapidly seized these new communication media to spread their ideas and give their sentiments concerning critical issues. In this context, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube have become very popular tools for sharing videos and communicating with users who interact with each other to discuss some problems, propose solutions and give viewpoints. This interaction on the social media sites yields to a huge amount of unstructured and noisy texts; hence the need for automated analysis techniques to classify sentiments conveyed in the users’ comments. In this work, we focus on opinions written in a less resourced Arabic language: Tunisian dialect (TD). In this work, we present a process for building a sentiment analyses model for comments written on Tunisian television broadcasts published in social media. These comments are written in a particular way with different spellings due to the fact that the Tunisian Dialect (TD) does not have an orthographic standard. For this we design crucial resources, namely sentiment lexicon and annotated corpus that we have used to investigate machine-learning and deep-learning models in order to identify the best sentiment analysis model for Tunisian Dialect. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V."
"The Philadelphia Negro pioneered the field of urban sociology. As a result, scholars often highlight its academic interventions that over a century after its publication remain germane to the study of cities and multiethnic populations in urban settings. While emphasis on the text’s scholarly originality and contemporary analytic relevancy is central to demonstrate its importance, consideration of The Philadelphia Negro’s book history provides an equally compelling account of its enduring significance. Book history addresses the creation of a book as a physical publication. Book history also considers the authorial choices behind infrastructural, textual adornments such as appendixes or maps. In addition, book history deals with subjects like cover art and how publishers and authors often cocreate the external visual presentation of a book’s interior contents. In this brief book history, I explore an editorial history of critical scholarly editions of The Philadelphia Negro, an analysis occasioned by a recent 2023 University of Pennsylvania Press updated edition of the text that features sociologist Elijah Anderson’s revised editorial introduction, first published in 1996. In other words, I historicize critical scholarly editions of The Philadelphia Negro to trace the book’s reception and meaning over time. I also examine selected textual and infrastructural features of each critical edition, most especially the book covers. Historical analysis of sociological writing summons historians (like me) to perform cross-disciplinary intellectual labor while it also invites sociologists to consider historical context more expansively in their assessment of sociological texts. © American Sociological Association 2023."

"Aim: To identify evidence on frontline nurse leaders' competences in evidence-based healthcare (EBHC) and the instruments measuring these competences. Design: A scoping review. Data Sources: The search was conducted in June 2021 and complemented in June 2022. The CINAHL, ProQuest, Medline (Ovid), Scopus, Web of Science databases and MedNar along with the Finnish database Medic were searched. Review Method: The scoping review was conducted in accordance with the Joanna Briggs institute methodology for scoping reviews. Titles, abstracts and full-text versions were screened independently by two reviewers according to the inclusion criteria. Deductive-inductive content analysis was used to synthesize data. Results: A total of 3211 articles published between 1997 and 2022 were screened, which resulted in the inclusion of 16 articles. Although frontline nurse leaders had a positive attitude towards EBHC, they had a lack of implementing EBHC competence into practice. Part of the instruments were used in the studies, and only one focused especially on leaders. None of instruments systematically covered all segments of EBHC. Conclusion: There is a limited understanding of frontline nurse leaders' competence in EBHC. It is important to understand the importance of EBHC in healthcare and invest in the development of its competence at all levels of leaders. Frontline nurse leaders' support is essential for direct care nurses to use EBHC to ensure the quality of care and benefits to patients. Leaders must enhance their own EBHC competence to become role models for direct care nurses. It is also essential to develop valid and reliable instruments to measure leaders' competence covering all EBHC segments. The results can be utilized in the assessment and development of frontline nurse leaders' EBHC competence by planning and producing education and other competence development methods. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"The promotion of healthy aging is one of the main challenges of our society in the face of the aging population phenomenon. Early detection of frailty, which is a geriatric syndrome that alters the lifestyle of the elderly and threatens their desire to live independently, is a challenge, and to date there is no consensual method for this detection. In this paper, we analyze the transcribed discourse of older adults, in response to a series of open-ended questions. To this end, the answers of 34 subjects aged over 80 years were transcribed into texts. The objective of this study is to evaluate the ability of discourse analysis to separate robust from pre-frail individuals. Explicitly, we ran through two text classification approaches: (i) the application of a linear model on the TF-IDF technique and (ii) the application of a recurrent neural network after encoding the words with the Word2Vec algorithm using pre-learned information. Our models identify potentially informative words in the corpus of older individuals recruited in this study. This study suggests that text analysis provides promising diagnostic utility in the analysis of frailty, and opens the door for further research. © 2023 European Signal Processing Conference, EUSIPCO.

"This paper aims to improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis on Apache Spark for a real-time general twitter data. A lot of works exist on sentiment analysis on offline or stored twitter data that uses several classification algorithms on relevant features extracted using well-known feature extraction methodologies on pre-processed text data. However, not much works exist for sentiment analysis of real-time twitter data and especially for the generic data on big data processing platforms such as Apache Spark. This paper proposes a real-time sentiment analysis for generic twitter data through Apache Spark using six classification algorithms on N-gram and Term Frequency — Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) feature extraction methodologies on the pre-processed data. An exhaustive comparison is done using Logistic Regression (LR), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Random Forest Classfier(RFC), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbour (K-NN), and Decision Tree (DT) classification algorithms. It is observed that the trigram feature extraction method performs the best on LR and SVM and the RFC results are also comparable on the considered general tweets data. © 2023 SCPE.

"This study of the Contendings between the Body and the Head presents a new edition and the first English translation of the Turin tablet CGT 58004. Closer analysis of the manuscript suggests a more precise date of the text and facilitates engagement with issues raised, but not expanded upon, by other scholars relating to its composition. Evidence will be considered as to firstly, whether the text was written by a student and secondly, whether the Contendings are extracted from a lengthier, no longer extant, composition. Lastly, it will be argued that an as yet unattested pedagogical method, that of abridgement, was being employed. (Figure presented.) © The Author(s) 2023."
"Poetry and spoken texts serve as dynamic instructional resources that enhance language proficiency in the domains of art and rhetoric while concurrently promoting language development. EFL learners hailing from Indonesia emphasise the significance of employing effective teaching methodologies while also shedding light on the challenges they face during the learning process. The analysis of poetry and speech texts authored by students reveals that the utilisation of template-based poetry plays a vital role in enhancing students' understanding of language and fostering significant literacy encounters. Creative ideas serve as catalysts, stimulating students to engage in experimentation with a wide range of literary genres and techniques. This study underscores the importance of speech analysis and the incorporation of rhetorical techniques in the construction of speech texts, enabling students to produce written works that demonstrate linguistic proficiency and evoke emotional resonance. However, persistent challenges include the use of appropriate language registers and maintaining linguistic coherence. This study emphasises the importance of employing innovative strategies to address these obstacles and promote the development of creative expression among English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. The results of this study offer valuable insights for educators, promoting the adoption of customised strategies to enhance students' abilities in composing poetry and speech texts in the Indonesian English as a Foreign Language (EFL) context. © 2023 EJAL & the Authors."
"The paper comparatively investigates two science fiction novels: the novel Futurological Congress: from the memories of Ijon Tichy (1971) by the Polish writer Stanisław Lem and The Invention of Athanatik (1975) by the Croatian writer Vladan Desnica. This paper will explore the textual constructions of emotions as parts of the dystopian perspective of the future that they have in common. Namely, contemporary constructivist approaches to emotions show that they are an important part of cognitive processes and that they are culturally conditioned entities. Starting from genre theories (Suvin, Šakić, Clute and Nicholls) and cultural, cognitivist and constructivist approaches to emotions (Lutz; Mesquita and Frijda; Hogan; Ekman and Cordaro; Ahmed; Damasio) and applying them in the analysis of literary texts, it will be proved that the emotional constructs of the future can be considered within the fundamental genre characteristics of science fiction. This means that they participate in the creation of a conceptual breakthrough in the paradigms of the current episteme, that they are parts of cognitive astonishment, i.e. a fictional novum valued by cognitive logic, and that their thematization within science fiction can contribute to the knowledge of the possible effects of cultural conditioning of emotions, as well as deepening knowledge about the genre characteristics of modern science fiction. © 2023, Croatian Philological Society.

"Purpose: This paper explores the way in which industrial pollution has been expressed in the narrative accounts of nature, landscape and industry by William Gilpin in his 18th-century picturesque travel writings. A positive description of pollution is generally outdated and unacceptable in the current society. The authors contrast his “picturesque” view with the contemporary perception of industrial pollution, reflect on these early accounts of industrial impacts as representing the roots of impression management and use the analysis to inform current accounting. Design/methodology/approach: The research uses an interpretive content analysis of the text to draw out themes and features of impression management. Goffman's impression management is the theoretical lens through which Gilpin's travel accounts are interpreted, considering this microhistory through a thematic research approach. The picturesque accounts are explored with reference to the context of impression management. Findings: Gilpin's travel writings and the “Picturesque” aesthetic movement, it appears, constructed a social reality around negative industrial externalities such as air pollution and indeed around humans' impact on nature, through a lens which described pollution as adding aesthetically to the natural landscape. The lens through which the picturesque tourist viewed and expressed negative externalities involved quite literally the tourists' tricks of the trade, Claude glass, called also Gray's glass, a tinted lens to frame the view. Originality/value: The paper adds to the wealth of literature in accounting and business pertaining to the ways in which companies socially construct reality through their accounts and links closely to the impression management literature in accounting. There is also a body of literature relating to the use of images and photographs in published corporate reports, which again is linked to impression management as well as to a growing literature exploring the potential for the aesthetic influence in accounting and corporate communication. Further, this paper contributes to the growing body of research into the historical roots of environmental reporting. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"This article presents an analysis of the metaphors that relate the domains of space and sexuality in the tetralogy Antagonía by Luis Goytisolo, based on a discourse dynamics approach. Metaphoremes such as <terreno erótico> and <erotismo geológico> are identified and analysed according to cognitive, linguistic, affective, and socio-cultural factors, with a focus on the first two. I also draw from the processes of source redeployment, development, literalization, and unrealism to explain the details of several discourse metaphors in the text. These are framed in their immediate and extended contexts. The results show the complex web of spatio-sexual metaphors readers encounter in the text and the rich array of resources the author uses to portray sexuality. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Male suicide rates represent a public health crisis. In almost every country, more men die by suicide than women and suicide is a leading cause of death for men in the United States and the United Kingdom. Evidence suggests that men are less likely than women to access professional support for suicidal distress. Ensuring more men access support is a critical component of suicide prevention. This study explores responses from 725 men, worldwide, who have attempted suicide or have had thoughts of suicide in the last year, to an open-text question about the barriers they experience to accessing professional support. Using a thematic analysis, results reveal the multifaceted barriers some men experience regarding a lack of motivation, a lack of psychological capability, and/or a lack of physical/social opportunity to access support. Findings suggest that many men have sought support but had negative experiences and that many others want help but cannot access it. Barriers include prohibitive costs and waiting times; potential costs to identity, autonomy, relationships and future life opportunities; a lack of perceived psychological capability; a lack of belief in the utility of services and a mistrust of mental health professionals. Findings suggest the importance of examining the role of male gender in male help-seeking behaviours. We suggest 23 recommendations for services and public health messaging to increase men's help-seeking behaviours. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an important research area for artificial intelligence studies. In the process of processing textual data, feature extraction and the creation of the word-document vector are very important. Especially for machine learning algorithms, these numerical vectors play a critical role in the creation of the model. Textual data must be preprocessed to generate these vectors. There are common methods such as removing stopwords, converting text to lowercase, and cleaning punctuation marks. The effects of these methods on the created model have also been investigated in the literature. However, it has not been investigated how the length values of the text can affect the model created. So how does a document or text having less than 10 or 20 characters affect the machine learning model? This study was carried out in order to solve this problem and fill the gap in the literature. The effect of text length on text classification models has been tested with different feature extraction methods. © 2023 IEEE."
"INTRODUCTION: In this paper we will study the Archive of the great 17th century writer, D. Francisco Manuel de Melo (Lisbon 1608 - 1666) according to the principles of Historical Archivistic. The idea of starting this study came from the intersection of our admiration for the work and Francisco Manuel de Melo with the reading of a remarkable essay by Eric Ketelaar on Rembrandt's Archives - Prologue: Rembrandt's Archives, included in his Archiving people. A social history of Dutch Archives, La Haye, Stichting Archiefpublicaties, 2020, p. 9- 14. Unlike the case of the famous Dutch painter, of whom no documents remain, from the Francisco Manuel's Archive there is/was a small nucleus of documentation preserved over generations by the descendants of a collateral branch, which was transcribed, published and studied by Edgar Prestage between 1909 and 1914 and which is now in unknown whereabouts. Our goal is to make a first approximation to what may have been the writer's archive at the time of his death in 1666, the reasons why and the manner in which the documentation was produced, its custodial history, the uses made of the documentation by the his heirs, and the historical, literary, sociological, and knowledgeable importance of the Ancient Regime society in the Hispanic world and in Portugal during the Restoration. The paper is structured in six chapters: 1 - METHODOLOGY - Our method will consist in the analysis of the published bibliography of Francisco Manuel de Melo from an archival point of view, i.e. studying the author as a producing entity of an Archive according to the guidelines of the Archival Method, as explained by Elio Lodolini, Luciana Duranti and Giovanni Michetti. The main work on Francisco Manuel is the biography - D. Francisco Manuel de Mello: Esboço biographico, Coimbra University Press, 1914, by Edgar Prestage, who was a noted historian, but with the characteristics of his time, i.e. using archives as a reservoir of historical information, as sources. This paper will be the beginning of an approach to this work taking the archive as the object of study, making the social history of the archive, putting into practice the principles of Historical Archivistics as they are defined by Maria de Lurdes Rosa, among many others, in her 2017 articles, 2018 with the collaboration of Rita Nóvoa, and in the doctoral theses she has supervised within the VINCULUM Project, which includes the Invent. Arq Project - Inventories of Family archives, XV-XIX centuries. 2 - BIOGRAPHICAL SUMMARY - We have established a summary of the biography of D. Francisco Manuel, based on Prestage's fundamental work, complemented with some of the contributions, which have uncovered new information and confirmed or updated known information. This summary introduces the reader to the personality who produced the documentation studied, with factual and chronological accuracy. 3 - D. FRANCISCO MANUEL, DOCUMENTATION PRODUCING ENTITY - Analysis of the main characteristics of the man integrated in his time and social environment, with recourse to a fundamental work on Francisco Manuel, authored by Camões Gouveia, which identifies very accurately, using techniques proper to history, several aspects of his personality that shaped the production and conservation of the documentation, namely the fact that he was a nobleman among noblemen. 4 - THE PHYSICAL AND HUMAN CONTEXT - The fourth chapter is dedicated to a survey of the places where he was born, where he lived, where he was imprisoned and exiled, as well as a possible inventory of the servants who served him during his life and influenced his documentary production. 5 - DESCRIPTION OF THE DOCUMENTATION - The fifth chapter presents a description, and characterization of the writer's documentary production, using tables in the text and in the appendix. In addition to the aforementioned work by Prestage, we will take into account documents located and described by Teófilo Braga, and Joan Estruch Tobella. 6 - CUSTODIAL HISTORY - In this chapter, based on many of the facts established in the previous chapters, we present the research on the history of the Archive of D. Francisco Manuel, using methods proper of History, to extend and develop the so-called Custodial History, which is already carried out by archivists and is foreseen in ISAD (G). We have also used genealogy to establish and identify the successive generations who owned parts of Francisco Manuel's archive, and we summarize the results of our investigations in three family trees. In it we follow the fate of the documentation from the date of the sudden death of D. Francisco Manuel's in August 1666, up to the present day. It was only possible to follow its path and the purposes for which it was successively used, by its various holders, until the beginning of the 20th century. From that date on, all hypotheses are possible, including the most terrible ones, which was the fate of many other archives in Portugal. CONCLUSIONS - In this brief but fascinating investigation, we have applied the principles of Historical Archivistics, to study the documentation produced by D. Francisco Manuel de Melo, in the context of his status as a nobleman and in the era of the Ancien Régime. Based on this work, we can present several lines of investigation to achieve a greater knowledge of the Archive of D. Francisco Manuel. This research shows the great importance of the study of family archives for the understanding of each of the individuals that make them up, giving much greater depth to their actions and making it possible to understand the limitations and qualities of each person inserted in his class and in his time. The deeper knowledge of what would have been the archives of D. Francisco Manuel de Melo will allow us to increase our knowledge of his literary work and the context in which it was written. A final negative conclusion, of a general nature, about the Portuguese culture of the last 250 years imposes itself at the conclusion of this work. It is the continued disinterest, laxity and lack of awareness of cultural values, as structuring elements of a free and developed society that characterizes Portugal. From one of the greatest Portuguese writers, who had an adventurous and fascinating life, nothing remains! Everything has disappeared: the houses where he lived, whose exact location is unknown, the graves of his sister, his mother, his grave, his Archive, the originals of most of his literary works! All lost! All destroyed! Quare? © 2023 Imprensa da Universidade de Coimbra. All rights reserved."
"The anti-vaccination movement has successfully spread its views on social media. This study examined how community building emerges in the messages of Dutch anti-vaccination Telegram groups. Particularly, we investigated the extent to which these groups provide a platform for sharing information, perpetuating a shared identity, and promoting action. As negative emotions are considered a prime driver of collective action, we examined to what extent the messages had a negative valence. We used a mixed-method approach through a quantitative content analysis of 4654 text messages from five Telegram groups, while also examining the nature of the content through a qualitative analysis. The results suggest that most messages contained a form of shared identity (ingroup favoritism and outgroup hostility) or (mis)information, and, to a lesser extent, encouragements for (online) action. Moreover, most content had a negative valence. These findings illustrate how online groups might be sources of (mis)information, polarization, and intergroup hostility. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Purpose: This study aims to explore the intelligibility of communication with stakeholders as a result of accrual accounting adoption. It focuses on changes in the use of visual forms and the readability of text that occurred immediately after the adoption of accrual accounting in performance reports of Italian public universities. Design/methodology/approach: The authors collect the stakeholder section of performance reports published before and after accrual accounting adoption. Then, the authors use manual and computer-assisted textual analysis. Finally, the authors explore the data using principal component analysis and qualitative comparative analysis. Findings: This study demonstrates that switching from cash to accrual accounting provokes immediate changes in communication patterns. It confirms the significant reduction of readability and increase in visual forms after accruals accounting adoption. The results indicate that smaller universities especially put effort into increasing intelligibility while implementing a more complex accounting system. This study also finds a relation between the change in readability and the change in visual forms that are complementary, with the exception of several very large universities. Practical implications: The findings underline the possibility of neutralising the adverse effects of accounting reform associated with its complexity and difficulties in understanding by the use of visual forms and attention to the document’s readability. Originality/value: This paper adds a new dimension to the study of public sector accounting from the external stakeholder perspective. It provides further insight into the link between accrual accounting adoption and readability, together with the use of visual forms by universities. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, China was the largest source country in Japan’s inbound tourism market. The middle class, with its high consumption desire, was the main contributor of Chinese tourists to Japan, an important force driving the Japanese economy and influencing the spread of Japan’s national image in China through the Internet. For this study, I collected 4,785 text data from Japan travelogues on two major Chinese travel websites between January 2016 and March 2022, conducted data mining and content analysis, and combined the texts to reveal the basic characteristics of Chinese middle-class tourists to Japan, as well as their perceptions and evaluations of Japan’s national image. The results show a change in the travel needs of the Chinese middle class from shopping, etc., to diverse, specific, and individual travel experiences and an obvious willingness to revisit. Regarding their perceptions and evaluations of Japan's macro national image, Japan’s national capacity is mainly reflected in its culture and economic technology, while its national characteristics are mainly reflected in hospitability. Although most impressed with Japan’s environmental management, mainly its infrastructure and natural resources, the macro sentiment of the tourists is influenced by historical Sino-Japanese relations and reveals reservations about Japan. Japan’s micro national image, as perceived by the tourists through tourist attractions, mainly relates to activities, while their perceptions of the tourist environment are the richest, focusing on popular attractions and landscapes. Their perceptions of tourism facilities cover various aspects such as catering, accommodation, transportation, entertainment, and services. Furthermore, their micro-emotions are mainly reflected in their satisfaction and praise of the destination environment. These results have several implications for tourism marketing and national image promotion in the post-pandemic era, when outbound tourism has fully recovered. © the authors, 2023.

"Cancer of the head and neck is a confronting condition, as the disease and its treatments alter the appearance and function of body organs associated with physical appearance and identity. Many of the risk factors for head and neck cancers, including tobacco, alcohol, and human papilloma virus, can also have significant negative social and moral permutations. Language and action (discourse) plays an important role in constructing disease and illness and shape the way it is managed, both institutionally and socially. This research used a critical constructionist lens to investigate how the common discourses surrounding head and neck cancer are constructed within the healthcare context and how this influences patients and healthcare professionals’ responses to the illness. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, field noting, journaling and literature reviews. Analysis was guided by a three-dimensional approach to critical discourse analysis that investigated text, discursive practices, and social context. The overarching finding was that deviance dominates the common discourse and shapes head and neck cancer and responses to it. Deviance is channelled through metaphors, adjectives, descriptors, and collective nouns and is made overt through labelling, avoidance, blaming, shame, and categorization. Discourse is contextualized by a sociocultural understanding that when someone deviates from what is perceived as normal, they are devalued. Open dialogue and reflection on head and neck cancer discourse could enable better understanding of how people experience their condition and inform more supportive responses. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The paper provides a succinct introduction to the special issue of Ethics and Politics dedicated to the book Seven Essays on Populism. For a Renewed Theoretical perspective written by the Argentine duo Paula Biglieri and Luciana Cadahia. To this purpose, it firstly outlines the growing scholarly tendency to conceptualise populism as an ontological phenomenon. Secondly, it provides some basic information about the scope of the text under analysis. Finally, it introduces two of the most discussed issues of the book, ie. the choice to consider populism as being inherently emancipatory based on a different way to conceive ontology and the connection between populism and feminism, with a brief overview of the contributors’ positions involved in this critical exchange. © 2023 Universita di Trieste.

"Background: The use of electronic systems supported by text-mining software applications that support the End TB strategy’ needs to be explored. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap, and synthesis of evidence. Methods: The PubMed database was searched for structured review articles published in English since 2012 on interventions to control and manage TB. Nine hundred twenty-five articles met the inclusion criteria. The included articles were synthesized using the text and content analysis software Leximancer. The themes were chosen based on the hit words that emerged in the frequency and heat maps. After the themes were chosen, the concept built the themes based on likelihood. Results: The framework resulting in the study focuses on early detection and treatment to minimize the chance of TB transmission in the population, especially for highly susceptable populations. The main area highlighted is the appropriate screening and treatment domains. The framework generated in this study is somewhat in line with the WHO Final TB Strategy. This study highlights the importance of improving TB prevention through a patient-centered approach and protecting susceptible populations. Conclusion: Our findings will be helpful in guiding TB practice, policy development and future research. Future research can elaborate the framework and elicit feedback from TB management stakeholdesr to assess its utility. © 2023 Handayani et al."
"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a highly prevalent public health challenge and human rights violation. Sociological theories address social structures to understand prevalence and dynamics of IPV against women. This systematic review aims (1) to identify, describe, categorize, and synthesize sociological theories that account for predictors of IPV against women, and (2) to compare and contrast sociological theories of predictors of IPV against women. Following a structured search of nine electronic databases, members of the review team screened title/abstract and full texts against inclusion and exclusion criteria, to identify studies that engaged with theory/ies of predictors of IPV. Review team members extracted data according to a data extraction template developed for the review. Results are presented using a narrative synthesis approach. Following review of 108 included articles, included articles were grouped into sub-theories. The sub-theories provide differing, yet overlapping, accounts of predictors of male perpetration of IPV and women’s experience of IPV. Sociological theories primarily engage with exo- and macro-system levels of the social-ecological framework, yet some also address structural influences on individual behaviors. This systematic review fills a gap in theoretical syntheses of sociological theories of predictors of male-perpetrated IPV against women and also provides critical analysis of how these theories overlap and intersect. While sociological theories may not be able to fully explain all aspects of dynamics of male-perpetrated IPV against women, this overview indicates that there are several compelling components of sociological theory that hold explanatory power for comprehending how, where, and why IPV occurs. © The Author(s) 2023."
"To effectively manage the data generated by IoT application’s multiple nodal points, it is crucial to have a centralised domain that can handle the infrastructure already in place. Storing data on a cloud server is proposed as a solution. The analysis of performance and efficiency is essential for evaluating the effectiveness of applications. A group of users with restricted access will be using raw data from the public domain to make changes. A limitation will be imposed on the quantity of data that can be obtained from the server. The cloud server’s data can be safeguarded by assign-ing a secret key to each user data that accesses it. Using a Cypher manuscript (CM) methodology within the cloud server architecture, this can be implemented. In the current system, however, the data privacy and data access rights are made public. As a result of the server-side communication of user rights and data accessibility rights to all users, complex data security challenges may arise. Consequently, the user rights and data access level should also be concealed from all users in order to increase data security and user access details. The suggested method uses a Hashing programming Technique on the Cypher manuscript (HT-CM) side to conceal server’s internal security-related information. The performance of proposed study is compared with existing systems in terms of data security and other related metrics. © 2023, Scibulcom Ltd.. All rights reserved."
"The anonymous author of the Life of Pope Mark I [BHL 5293, 5294, 5294a], composed at the invitation of John, cardinal of the title of St. Mark in Rome, exhibits a well-defined literary profile, characterized by an evident interest in lexical preciousness. Upon closer analysis of the text, it becomes evident that the author drew inspiration from a rare work, the Polipticum attributed to Atto of Vercelli. An examination of the data obtained from the text and its tradition leads to the hypothesis that the short work, published here in its entirety for the first time, was composed in the second half of the 11th century, most likely in an area between Tuscany and Rome. © SISMEL-Edizioni del Galluzzo 2023."
"A considerable flow of information and news stories are being exchanged on social media in several parts of the world. A significant number of news stories are fake and are published to serve certain purposes and ideologies. The present study examines how Arab social media users respond to fake news in Arabic in reference to van Dijk’s concept of the ideological square. A dataset of fake news was collected from Twitter, now X platform, comprising tweets on various events. After preprocessing, a topic-modeling algorithm was applied to the dataset to reveal its latent aspects. Instances of the featured topics in the dataset were then analyzed in accordance with the sociocognitive approach to critical discourse analysis. The findings demonstrate that fake news was leveraged to promote ideological struggle between social groups. Some social media users may interact with misinformation without evaluating its credibility and, therefore, express ideologically loaded beliefs for or against the subject matter of the news story. Fake news stories were also exploited for business and marketing. Misinformation’s discourse structure involves ideological polarization, self-identification and goal-description, and violates norms and values. The discursive structure and strategies revolve around the ideological square. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Which companies gain and which companies lose from trade agreements? In contrast to a view that sees the largest companies as the main beneficiaries of trade agreements, we argue that medium‐sized companies gain the most from them. Moreover, we examine whether more capital‐intensive and more diversified companies benefit more than other firms. Our empirical test relies on a dataset with daily firm‐level stock price data for close to 4,000 US companies over the period 2009–2016. Concretely, we assess how the shares of different types of firms reacted to the news on the (lack of) progress of the negotiations aimed at concluding the TPP and TTIP. We find support for the view that medium‐sized and diversified companies win the most from trade agreements. Besides speaking to the literature on the distributional effects of trade agreements, the article contributes to recent research on the role of firms in the international political economy and the stock market consequences of political events. It also presents a novel approach to measuring progress and stagnation in international trade negotiations using computational text analysis. © 2023 by the author(s); licensee Cogitatio Press (Lisbon, Portugal)."
"Even a full realization of the absence of permanent self, a core teaching of Buddhism, does not stop the process by which a subject is imputed and then moves to apprehend objects. Not only is the nature of perception dualistic, the way objects are conceptualized relies on a further round of dualistic discrimination. A key role in the setting up of mutually exclusive categories, such as inner and outer, defilement and purification, and nirvāna and saṃsāra, that underlie conventional perception is played by language. The Teaching of Vimalakīrti aspires to eliminate this illness of misperception by altering the way language is used. Rich in paradox, this early Mahāyāna text deploys the concept of non-duality to offset the mind’s dichotomizing tendencies, testing the limits of both language and perception in the process. While the importance of non-duality for Mahāyāna and its prominence in the Vimalakīrti have been duly noted by numerous scholars and dharma teachers, I have not come across a study that would scrutinize the contexts in which the term first crops up in this sūtra or that would categorize the thirty-two ways of transcending duality suggested in its culminating eighth chapter. Going quotation by quotation, I provide a close reading of relevant passages and at the end break them down into three types. In the process, I also show that Vimalakīrti’s most effective way of countering duality is based on the idea of sameness, or equality, of things which poses certain ethical questions. Finally, my textual analysis leads me to challenge the view prevalent in scholarship on non-duality which takes the term to denote—even in regard to this text—a higher metaphysical reality. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"This article studies a model of a saint emperor formulated by Eusebius of Caesarea in the Life of Constantine, one of the earliest texts in hagiographic literature. The analysis is based on Eusebius’ typological comparison of Emperor Constantine with the biblical figure of Moses. As part of this comparison, a development of a “sacred history” in the biography of the Christian ruler is being traced as a specific continuation of the biblical narrative. Using Philo’s of Alexandria theory about the natural law as a “non-written prototype” of Moses’ laws, Eusebius reveals the sacred prototype of Emperor Constantine’s life, which makes him similar to Moses. Following the Logos enables Constantine to implement on a new level the same prototype which had been implemented by Moses a long time ago. In the typological line “Constantine — Moses” one can trace three stages of Constantine’s development in the sacred history, i.e. receiving the kingdom, receiving the priestly ministry, and acquiring the gift of prophesy. The article analyses Eusebius’ comparison of the battle between Constantine and Maxentius at the Milvian Bridge with the biblical story of pharaoh’s defeat when the Jews were crossing the Red Sea. The periphrastic comparison of the biblical narrative and the contemporary history signifies not only the dependence of one storyline on the other, but also shows their dependence on the Logos which acts in history as the Law of nature, guiding and shaping historical events. In the Emperor’s Life, Eusebius reflects the integral principle that guides and shapes the history and is present both in the sacred events of the story of Moses and in the relatively recent events associated with Constantine. The biblical story, perceived “by ear” and for this reason looking like a “myth”, acquires visible features, while the contemporary reality gains the meaning of the sacred biblical story. The Life of Constantine therefore demonstrates the mechanism of establishing sacred events in the cultural memory; these events represent a specific sacred line of the history. © 2023 St. Tikhon's University.

"Sentiment analysis discovers the emotion expressed in a text. It helps in analyzing the product reviews, customer feedback and survey responses. Researchers have developed various algorithms for this purpose, however, they have majorly focused only on the sentiment analysis in English language. Although, few works are available for Hindi and multilingual sentiment analysis, however, these works are not efficient enough to perform sentiment analysis in code-mixed languages. To overcome the limitation of the existing works, this paper presents a multilingual code-mixed language model which identifies the sentiments of the hate speech dataset extracted from Twitter. As the hate speech dataset with sentiment labels are not available, we first collect the data from Twitter. After that we label the data using a transformer-based pretrained sentiment analysis model trained on a large corpus of tweets in multiple languages. We pass our collected data as test data to this model and predict the sentiment labels. Now, we train six different machine learning models to perform our own task i.e sentiment analysis for multilingual code-mixed hate speech dataset. The machine learning models perform well across multiple languages and also code-mixed languages. In future, it can be easily adapted to different classification tasks based on code-mixed languages. The results yield that hate speech invokes negative sentiment whereas non-hate speech reflects either positive or neutral sentiment. © 2023 SCPE. All Rights Reserved."
"Bot accounts on X (formerly known Twitter)1 are a growing issue that limits and negatively impacts the browsing and sharing experience of Twitter users, and it is important to identify such accounts. In this work, we perform machine learning-based estimation of bot accounts on Twitter. Using Twitter's API, a data set is collected containing tweets and related metadata from various accounts. Feature engineering techniques are then applied to highlight relevant features such as sentiment analysis of the account's tweets, or the account's friend/follower ratio. Using these features to train and evaluate machine learning models, the likelihood of a given account being a bot is estimated. The performances of three different models are comparatively analyzed based on their fl score, accuracy, precision, and recall. Analysis of feature importances shows the success of derived features in identifying bot accounts. This work demonstrates the potential of using feature engineering with tweet and profile properties to detect bot accounts on Twitter, and provides a foundation for further research on this topic.1In October 2022, Twitter was acquired, after which Twitter Inc. ceased to exist as an independent company and was merged with X Corp. To prevent possible inconsistencies and confusion in literature search results, we used the name Twitter throughout the text. © 2023 IEEE."
"The Catalan brand Estrella Damm (a beer produced in Barcelona) is very popular for its summer advertisements. The ‘Mediterràniament’ commercials (2009–2021) reinforce the Mediterranean culture through its people, gastronomy and landscape. Estrella Damm commercials are produced in Catalan and Spanish, and some are produced in Catalan, then translated into Spanish, and finally subtitled in English, since Estrella beer is sold internationally. This paper examines how indirect translation (Catalan, Spanish, English) has been used in Estrella Damm ‘Mediterràniament’ advertising campaign through textual analysis of commercials and through interviews to the translators who created the Estrella Damm international versions from mediating texts. In indirect translation involving related languages, each version can affect one another: creative options for one text in Catalan can be adopted in the Spanish version, which may also influence the final English version. Therefore, translation for advertising in bilingual contexts contributes to visibilizing mediating languages and versions. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"In the evolving landscape of online communities, the dispute between social integration and fragmentation has sparked ongoing debates. With the advent of technologically mediated social networks, understanding the structure of these communities remains a challenge. This study introduces a fresh, text-based technique to quantify the alignment of online communities along social dimensions. Through the analysis of historical Reddit data, community representations are generated from Reddit posts and projected onto ideological-partisan axes. This approach successfully scores communities, effectively situating them on the political-ideological spectrum. Our approach rests on the premise that the language, topics, parlance, and discourse style employed by communities offer insights into their ideological leanings. We found that using posts' text we can build a very similar and correlated partisan-ness ranking to the one inferred through user interactions, which reinforces our premise. This text-based approach also enables the analysis of books, news, blogs, and other sources that were not possible with previous approaches. Our results underscore the advantages of transformer-based embeddings when compared to skip-gram embeddings trained on the same dataset. This work contributes to the understanding of online community structures and their ideological foundations.  © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"Imagining Morocco is endemic to foreign writings. The latter have been subject to critical analysis across disciplines. However, in reviewing different studies undertaken about Morocco in the writings of foreigners, it becomes conspicuous that much scholarly interest has been invested in French and British writings about Morocco. Hence, literary productions by other foreign writers have often received scant attention. German literary discourse about Morocco is a good case in point. The current article studies The Voices of Marrakesh (1978) in which Elias Canetti, a German writer, recounts his experiences and exotic encounters during a three-week trip to Marrakesh, Morocco. Interestingly, Canetti’s text is not entirely enmeshed and imprisoned in, at least prima facie, long-standing, and homogenous Orientalist conceptions of far-flung spaces. Rather, images of exoticism and desire for Morocco are also persisted by inference or innuendo. Informed by theoretical approaches to questions of cultural encounters, this article explores the representations of Moroccan people and space through Canetti’s eye/ear. In so doing, it brings to the limelight different ways in which images of Morocco vacillate between Western Orientalism and astounding desire for Morocco, spotlighting therefore Canetti’s ambivalent attitudes vis-à-vis Morocco as a different cultural space. © 2023, Universite Mohammed V de Rabat - Institut Scientifique.

"This study suggests a unique method for assessing employee performance that makes use of blockchain technology and natural language processing (NLP). The conventional techniques for evaluating performance, such as yearly reviews and appraisals, sometimes rely on subjective assessments and could not completely capture an employee's total performance. The research gathers text data written by employees from a variety of sources and uses NLP methods to extract pertinent aspects including sentiment analysis and text categorization. Smart contracts are used to store the extracted characteristics on a blockchain network, guaranteeing the results' transparency and immutability. Utilizing the characteristics that have been retrieved and the data that has been recorded on the blockchain network, the workers' performance is assessed in the last phase. The suggested technique combines the benefits of blockchain technology with NLP to provide a more dependable and accurate way for evaluating employee performance.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are evidence of the imbalance of human’s exploitation of nature through irresponsible consumption. This study has two purposes. First, it analyses how short stories and critical theories such as bioregionalism and ecocriticism can sensitize B-School learners to establish and sustain a lost relationship with nature. Second, it examines how establishing and reviving a solid relationship between purusha [human beings] and prakriti [nature] can help achieve SDGs through literature. To achieve these two aims, we critically examine Ruskin Bond’s short stories by employing the concept of bioregionalism. Our interpretation of the text and analysis of these stories showed strong connections between Bond’s short stories, bioregionalism and sensitizing readers. It was observed that if students are exposed to consuming such literature in their natural surroundings, it can increase their zeal to achieve SDGs. Incorporating literature in management education can raise awareness of responsible consumption as personal social responsibility. © 2023 Indian Institute of Management Kozhikode."
"Throughout the 19th century, the French society showed a strong interest in Greece, which was consolidated by a profusion of travel accounts. The travel literature of this century presents the case of two texts written by women, whose approach relates to the viaticum genre itself as well as to women’s writing. This article analyses these two travel narratives in order to make visible the opinions of two French-speaking women travelers on liberated Greece and its inhabitants. These are the first volume of Valérie de Gasparin’s Journal d’un voyage au Levant (1848) and Marie-Anne de Bovet’s La jeune Grèce (1897). While focusing on the same subjects (women, the clergy, the political sphere), the analysis of the two accounts illustrates the relativism of the values of the two women travelers due to the fact that they visit Greece at two different moments in history and have different identities. © 2023, Institute of Balkan Studies and Center of Thracology Prof Alexander Fol Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.

"With the evolution of several online platforms for information sharing such as social media, blogs, product review sites, and discussion forums, people have become more proactive in sharing their expectations, views, feelings, and experiences. This large amount of emotionally wrapped data motivates many researchers to perform data mining and present the crux of hidden emotions or mental states in a more presentable and comprehensible manner. It has several applications in different domains such as business, education, psychology, politics, and many more. This paper presents a detailed literature review projected to rigorously analyze the existing approaches to identify the mental or emotional state of a person from unstructured textual data. We include the most relevant papers which were published during 2001-2022. The selected papers are classified into three categories: granularity level, contextual level, and cognition level. Each category is carefully analyzed followed by a detailed and critical discussion. Finally, open challenges, opportunities, applications, and future directives are presented in-depth to facilitate the researchers working in the domain of emotion mining. © 2023 SCPE.

"This chapter addressed the application of knowledge management (KM) in the largely unexplored context of arts and humanities. A specific KM approach (distant reading) was applied in the study of a literary text (historical Bosnian novel) to uncover the structure and dynamics of its character network. Using Gephi software and social network analysis measures, the study revealed key players, their ties as well as the strength and cohesion within the network. This helped us to better understand socio-psychological aspects of Bosnian society during the Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia. Furthermore, the study suggests that a combination of distant reading techniques and tools can provide valuable support for the complex interpretation of a literary work and enable a better-grounded account of European literary history and cultural identity. More generally, the value of distant reading in KM goes beyond literary history for the purpose of exploring emerging patterns in complex domains from many different sectors of social and economic activities. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Stage fright is a natural and very common phenomenon that affects everyone who must present themselves in public. However, it has a negative impact on the health and voice emission of children and adolescents, which is why it is important to study and measure it. Unfortunately, there are no appropriate tools for examining public presentation anxiety intended for children and adolescents, and that would also include the context of voice production. The main aim of this study was to describe stage fright and to present the stages of creating a tool based on the three-factor theory of stage fright constructs. The text describes the steps of developing the questionnaire, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, reliability, and convergent and discriminant validity. The results of the conducted analyses confirmed the three-factor structure of the tool and suggest that the Stage Fright Scale – Children & Youth is a reliable and consistent questionnaire for measuring stage fright in children and adolescents. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The purpose of the article is a step-by-step review of the codification works on the Codex Theresianus conclusion of 1766 and the outlining of the structure and the analysis of the main content of all Draft Code revisions, as well as clarifying the significance of the reception of Roman law during its conclusion. Hence, the author outlined the general work schedule of the Compilation Commission in Brno, which contained the primary structure of the Draft of Codex Theresianus. So, the content of the revisions of the Draft Code text, developed by the Compilation Commission, the Legislative Commission headed by Josef Azzoni, and the Legislative Commission under the supervision of Hofrat Zenker, were considered. In the process of this research, the author identified certain differences in the structure and revealed the peculiarities of some provisions in different versions. The durability of the Roman tradition of civil-law institutions and the content of some of their norms and, accordingly, the connection of the civil-law doctrine of the Austrian Empire with Roman law have been ascertained. In addition, the article broadly presents an analysis of the state of research in Ukrainian historical and legal science, both modern and at the end of the 19th – beginning of the 20th centuries, history of the sources of law, including the Draft of Codex Theresianus, and individual institutions of civil law of the Habsburg monarchy. © 2023, STS Science Centre Ltd.

"Ben-Peretz's (1975) concept of intended curriculum describes a version of curriculum that ‘official’ curriculum developers create to provide a detailed guide to what teachers are required to teach in schools. While some curricula are intended to guide learning, others give a more definitive regulation of what must be taught. Either way, they are a product of curriculum developers writing government policy that defines what is considered essential for students to know. The teacher then undertakes the technical task of interpreting these policy texts to discern how they will introduce the content to their students. Once the teacher receives the curriculum text, they begin a translation process. While the curriculum developer has a vision of how teachers will interpret the curriculum, the teacher's translation of the curriculum text is filtered through the teachers' understanding of the subject matter. This notion of ‘curriculum potential’ represents the culmination of the teacher's subject matter knowledge acquired throughout their education and career which serves as the reference point for curriculum interpretation. This article describes the process of curriculum interpretation used by primary teachers during the implementation of Australian curriculum reform. The study examined the interpretation process from the intended curriculum to the planned curriculum to the enacted curriculum used by the teachers and the influences impacting upon these processes. The analysis of the teachers' interpretations was demonstrated through a process for curriculum mapping developed for this study. This work will present the teachers' pathways to curriculum enactment as a hermeneutic interpretation of curriculum, revealing the teachers' curriculum potential. While frequently descriptions of curriculum potential focuss on subject matter knowledge, analysis of primary teacher curriculum interpretation necessitates a broader definition. The paper concludes that the primary teachers' interpretation process is drawn from a wider curriculum potential that intersects their knowledge of subject matter and knowledge of their students. © 2023 The Authors.

"Koyré in Dr. Jacques Lacan’s laboratory. In the present article, we seek to reconstruct the dialogue between Lacan and Koyré, which took place in the 1954-1955 seminar, over Plato’s Meno. Unfortunately, there is no recording of the class, we are only left with some discussions that were taken up during the open seminars. Nonetheless, in his book Discovering Plato, Koyré devoted one of the chapters precisely to this text. As we have discussed in this work, his interpretation of the platonic text explains why Lacan approached the theme of resistance in analysis, comparing the analysts of his generation to the character Meno. © 2023 Instituto de Psicologia.

"Online customer reviews have become an increasingly influential tool in shaping purchasing decisions. However, the growing impact of these reviews has led to a surge in the publication and promotion of fake reviews by some businesses, either to enhance their own product's reputation or to undermine their competitors. These counterfeit reviews can have an especially detrimental impact on small businesses, with even a single negative fake review capable of causing significant damage. In this context, the current study introduces a technique for classifying and identifying fake reviews using machine learning (ML) methodologies. The proposed algorithm was applied to the Yelp dataset for hotel services. The text was initially preprocessed through four stages: tokenization, normalization, stop word removal, and stemming. Subsequently, features were extracted using TFIDF techniques to leverage the benefits of sentiment analysis and to ascertain the presence of spam comments in the feature extraction approach. During the classification phase, the study employed three ML algorithms: Xgboost, a support vector classifier, and stochastic gradient descent. The proposed model was evaluated on both balanced and imbalanced datasets, using oversampling and undersampling techniques to determine its accuracy. The findings of this research hold promise for enhancing the credibility of online reviews and protecting businesses from the adverse effects of fake reviews. By unmasking fraudulent reviews, this study contributes to ensuring the integrity of online review platforms and safeguarding the interests of both businesses and consumers. © 2023 Lavoisier.

"Purpose: Adolescent mental health is a global concern. There is an urgent need for creative, multimedia interventions reflecting adolescent culture to promote mental health literacy and well-being. This study aims to assess the impact of a film-based intervention on adolescent mental health literacy, well-being and resilience. Design/methodology/approach: A pretest-posttest intervention with a multi-methods evaluation was used. A convenience sample of ten schools facilitated students aged 15–17 years to engage in an online intervention (film, post-film discussion, well-being Webinar). Participants completed surveys on well-being, resilience, stigma, mental health knowledge and help-seeking. Five teachers who facilitated the intervention participated in post-implementation interviews or provided a written submission. Analysis included paired-t-test and effect size calculation and thematic analysis. Findings: Matched pretest-posttest data were available on 101 participants. There were significant increases in well-being, personal resilience and help-seeking attitudes for personal/emotional problems, and suicidal ideation. Participants’ free-text comments suggested the intervention was well-received, encouraging them to speak more openly about mental health. Teachers similarly endorsed the intervention, especially the focus on resilience. Originality/value: Intinn shows promise in improving adolescents’ mental health literacy and well-being. Film-based interventions may encourage adolescents to seek professional help for their mental health, thus facilitating early intervention. © 2023, John Goodwin, Laura Behan, Mohamad M.

"Purpose: The primary objective of this research is to provide a precise interpretation of the constructed machine learning model and produce definitive summaries that can evaluate the influence of investor sentiment on the overall sales of non-fungible token (NFT) assets. To achieve this objective, the NFT hype index was constructed as well as several approaches of XAI were employed to interpret Black Box models and assess the magnitude and direction of the impact of the features used. Design/methodology/approach: The research paper involved the construction of a sentiment index termed the NFT hype index, which aims to measure the influence of market actors within the NFT industry. This index was created by analyzing written content posted by 62 high-profile individuals and opinion leaders on the social media platform Twitter. The authors collected posts from the Twitter accounts that were afterward classified by tonality with a help of natural language processing model VADER. Then the machine learning methods and XAI approaches (feature importance, permutation importance and SHAP) were applied to explain the obtained results. Findings: The built index was subjected to rigorous analysis using the gradient boosting regressor model and explainable AI techniques, which confirmed its significant explanatory power. Remarkably, the NFT hype index exhibited a higher degree of predictive accuracy compared to the well-known sentiment indices. Practical implications: The NFT hype index, constructed from Twitter textual data, functions as an innovative, sentiment-based indicator for investment decision-making in the NFT market. It offers investors unique insights into the market sentiment that can be used alongside conventional financial analysis techniques to enhance risk management, portfolio optimization and overall investment outcomes within the rapidly evolving NFT ecosystem. Thus, the index plays a crucial role in facilitating well-informed, data-driven investment decisions and ensuring a competitive edge in the digital assets market. Originality/value: The authors developed a novel index of investor interest for NFT assets (NFT hype index) based on text messages posted by market influencers and compared it to conventional sentiment indices in terms of their explanatory power. With the application of explainable AI, it was shown that sentiment indices may perform as significant predictors for NFT sales and that the NFT hype index works best among all sentiment indices considered. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"This text is the result of the work developed at the Direção Regional do Arquivo e Biblioteca da Madeira (DRABM) in the context of a curricular internship, as part of the Postgraduate Course in Historical Archivistics at the NOVA School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the NOVA University of Lisbon. The aim of this research was to study the Calisto Pinto da Silva Family Archive based on the methodological principles in Historical Archivistics advocated by Professor Maria de Lurdes Rosa in her article: “Reconstructing the production, recording and conservation of Pre-modern organizational information. Theoretical perspectives and research proposal”. In the last two decades, a renewed position and a particular interest in the “Archives” has been notorious, materializing all this attention in the fruitful debates encouraged by the academy with the significant increase of the formative offer to dynamize and promote epistemological perspectives resulting from the production of Master’s and Doctoral Dissertations, as well as by the archive institutions themselves, which have demonstrated the ability to promote a critical sense and develop an effective dialogue between a practical-technical dimension. At the same time, the general interest in archival science is accompanied by the importance given to issues of community, family and personal archives. Despite the vitality and remarkable momentum corresponding to the dawn of the 21st century, reference should be made to the 1980s of the last century, a moment in which an embryonic phase was established in terms of the visibility and primary focus of the respective studies in Portugal. Conferences and meetings of an international nature and inestimable value were organized for the publication of numerous titles. More recently, the efforts of Professor Maria de Lurdes Rosa in raising studies on the Family Archives should be noted, materialized in the organization of colloquiums and meetings alluding to the theme, namely the colloquium held in Lisbon in 2010, Arquivos de Família, séculos XII-XX: que presente, que futuro? and in the commitment to curriculum offer through the inauguration of the Postgraduate Course in Historical Archivistics and the Phd in Historical Archivistics at the NOVA School of Social Sciences and Humanities of the NOVA University of Lisbon. The Calisto Pinto da Silva Family Archive, donated to the Arquivo Regional e Biblioteca Pública da Madeira, brings together a set of 95 documents, dating from 1824 to 1930. The overwhelming majority of the titles present in the aforementioned collection correspond to instruments of an administrative-financial nature and asset management of properties registered in favor of this family. The Calisto Pinto da Silva Family Archive had an inventory dated 1999, the year of the donation. It should be noted that the available inventory was out of date, allowing the reader to access only the minimum of information elements of a documentation described at the simplest level. The description did not respect, at all, the international norms of archiving, enshrined by the Council International Archives. Oriented according to an eminently chronological and empiricist principle, the previous descriptive instrument, in addition to being not very detailed, revealed considerable absences regarding the contextualization and framing of the documents. Through the treatment of the Calisto Pinto da Silva Family Archive, several questions of great interest to the theme of the Family Archives arise, namely deep reflections on the role played by the archive in the construction of a family and personal identity and memory. This Archive turns out to be truly illustrative of an attempt to preserve, legitimize and consequently defend a very significant commercial image, achieved in the circumstance that the majority of documentation corresponds to titles of a financial management nature and others records guaranteeing the effective ownership of a given immovable property. In practice, the aim is to perpetuate an essentially economic and financial memory of the family, in an incessant appreciation of contractual matters, as well as the transmission of assets. Linked to a set of family rituals, visible right from the start, in the preservation of the legacy and subsequent transmission of the patronymic to the firstborn, in an express act of perpetuation of traditions, the Calisto Pinto da Silva Family reveals, within the scope of its dynamics and family interactions and to the values and mentalities of the time, the circumstance of the patriarch taking on an important role in the management of resources and in the administration of properties. Similarly to what generally happened in the Madeira Archipelago, several family members resorted to emigration in order to seek better conditions and business opportunities with the city of Caracas, Venezuela, as their primary destination. From the detailed analysis of the Calisto Pinto da Silva Family Archive, at first sight, lines of investigation of the greatest relevance to the history of local commerce emerge, with particular emphasis on the social, economic and cultural aspects linked to commercial practices and their impact on mentalities and experiences in a period between the middle of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. In this sense, participatory archival activities and crowdsourcing around the archives of historic stores or small traditional family businesses would be interesting, in which testimonies alluding to the memory and stories of these places that represent the culture, habits and customs of the people of Madeira Island. © 2023 Imprensa da Universidade de Coimbra.

"Purpose: This study is aimed to explore risk factors affect the therapy outcomes of adrenal metastases (AM) for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and guide clinical dose selection. Methods and materials: PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched in September 22, 2022 in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines (PRISMA). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were used to search for sources of heterogeneity and identify risky outcomes factors. Publication bias test and sensitivity analysis were also conducted. Results: Thirty-three studies with full text from 2009 to 2022 about AM with SBRT on 1483 patients were included. Pooled 1- and 2-year local control (LC) and overall survival(OS) were 81.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 75.6%-86.5%), 62.8% (95% CI, 53.8%-71.8%), 67.4% (95%CI, 61.8%-73.1%) and 46.5% (95%CI, 40.4%-52.6%), respectively. Biological effective dose (BED, α/β=10Gy) and dose per fraction affected 1-year LC (Qm=23.89, 15.10; P<0.0001, 0.0001). In the range of 60-80Gy (BED10), the group of dose per fraction ≥ 9Gy achieved the excellent 1-year LC (< 9Gy: ≥ 9Gy =78%, 91%; χ2 = 10.16, P = 0.001). Tracking technology significantly affected 1- and 2-year OS (Qm = 5.73, 8.75; P = 0.017, 0.003) and high tracking adoption group showed excellent 1- and 2- year OS (78.7% [95%CI, 68.6%- 88.9%]; and 62.9% [95%CI, 53.1%-72.7%]). Conclusion: Increasing the dose per fraction appropriately may help control locally AM lesious. Tracking technology might contribute to improve survival of advanced patients with AM. But these results need prospective studies to verify them. Copyright © 2023 Liao, Kishi, Du, Komaki, Mizoe, Aikawa, Zheng and Pan."
"Objective To describe the study methods and baseline characteristics of participants enrolled in mCessation program. Methods This is a longitudinal, real‑world study with non‑randomized controlled design. The mCessation program consisted of a WeChat official account, an applet and a website using the same name‘mCessation Online’. After users followed the WeChat account, filled in baseline information online and set a quit date, they would receive 162 short text messages in the next six and a half months as scheduled. This study collected the information of participants enrolled from May 26, 2021 to September 30, 2022, and analyzed baseline data including demographic characteristics, smoking characteristics, degree of tobacco dependence, reasons for smoking cessation and other related factors. Results During the study period, a total of 16 746 participants registered, and 13 887 participants (82.9%) were enrolled in final analysis after screening the inclusion and exclusion criteria and completion of main indicators. Each year the number of enrolled participants in May or June was 1 381 to 2 707 per month, higher than the number of enrolled participants in other months (233 to 569 per month). Participants from North China accounted for the largest proportion (29.3%). There were 13 316 men (95.9%) in enrolled participants and the mean age was (36±10) years. Most participants were 25-34 (38.8%) or 35-44 (30.8%) years old. In terms of smoking characteristics, there were 12 564 (90.5%) daily smokers. The starting age of smoking was 18 (15, 20) years old. 11 866 participants (85.4%) were tobacco dependent, mostly with degree of mild (76.4%) or moderate (20.2%).

"Social networks function as a strategy for the promotion and dissemination of tourism destinations. The objective of this systematic review is to determine what is known about the use of social networks as a tool for tourism promotion, in the scientific literature between 2012 and 2022. The Prisma methodology (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses) was used, the databases were Science direct, Taylor and Francis, Dialnet, Redalyc and Scielo, with a total of 49 systematized articles, the inclusion criteria were those that are published between 2012 and 2022, are in Spanish, English or Portuguese language, and that have free access. The results obtained determine that, 78 % of the articles are current as of 2017, with a significant decrease during 2020 due to the global health crisis. It is concluded that the use of social networks by tourists allows them to publicize a destination indirectly, and they do so by posting photos and videos, accompanied by texts, either with information about the destination or with inspirational phrases. Finally, it is mentioned that there is a wide variety of social networks that could be used to promote a destination; but, among the most relevant we have Instagram, Facebook and Twitter, which have been observed in most of the articles, regardless of the category, are used as the main social networks for the dissemination and promotion of destinations. Tiktok could also be included as a social network with a lot of diffusion power; however, there are still not many studies that support this information. © the authors, 2023. All Rights Reserved."
"Background: Work is a social determinant of health that is often overlooked. There are major work-related differences in the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‑CoV‑2) infection and death, but there have been few analyses of infection rates across industry groups. To date, only one national assessment of SARS-CoV-2 infection prevalence by industry based on self-report has been completed. No study has looked at seroprevalence of COVID-19 by industry. Methods: During May–December 2021, blood donors with SARS-CoV-2 antinucleocapsid testing were sent an electronic survey about their work. Free-text industry responses were classified using the North American Industry Classification System. We estimated seroprevalence and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of SARS-CoV-2 infection by industry. Results: Of 57,726 donors, 7040 (12%, 95% CI: 11.9%−12.5%) had prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. Seroprevalence was highest among Accommodation & Food Services (19.3%, 95% CI: 17.1%−21.6%), Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction (19.2%, 95% CI: 12.8%−27.8%), Healthcare & Social Assistance (15.6%, 95% CI: 14.9%−16.4%), and Construction (14.7%, 95% CI: 13.1%−16.3%). Seroprevalence was lowest among Management of Companies & Enterprises (6.5%, 95% CI: 3.5%−11.5%), Professional Scientific & Technical Services (8.4%, 95% CI: 7.7%−9.0%), and Information (9.9%, 95% CI: 8.5%−11.5%). Conclusions: While workers in all industries had serologic evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, certain sectors were disproportionately impacted. Disease surveillance systems should routinely collect work characteristics so public health and industry leaders can address health disparities using sector-specific policies. © 2023 Wiley Periodicals LLC."
"Motivated by the growing role of AI in text generation and the potential misuse of generative tools, this study investigates key features that differentiate AI-generated text from human-authored content. We produce a corpus of AI-generated counterparts to 2.100 research paper abstracts, in order to compare formal linguistic and stylometric characteristics such as perplexity, grammar, n-gram distributions and function word frequencies between human- and AI-generated texts. Key findings indicate that human-written abstracts tend to exhibit higher perplexity, greater grammatical error, and more diverse n-gram distributions. To distinguish between the two types of texts we employ various machine learning algorithms, with our Random Forest implementation achieving a precision of 0.986 on unseen data. Notably, feature importance analysis reveals that perplexity, grammar, and n-gram distributions are highly influential in AI-detection classification. Our research contributes a nuanced study of discriminating characteristics of AI-generated text to the increasingly important field of AI authorship attribution.  © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors."
"Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is a crucial technology that enables machines to automatically recognize human voices based on audio signals. In recent years, there has been a rigorous growth in the development of ASR models with the emergence of new techniques and algorithms. One such model is the Whisper ASR model developed by OpenAI, which is based on a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture and can handle multiple tasks such as language identification, transcription, and translation. However, there are still limitations to the Whisper ASR model, such as speaker diarization, summarization, emotion detection, and performance with Indian regional languages like Hindi, Marathi and others. This research paper aims to enhance the performance of the Whisper ASR model by adding additional components or features such as speaker diarization, text summarization, emotion detection, text generation and question answering. Additionally, we aim to improve its performance in Indian regional languages by training the model on common voice 11 dataset from huggingface. The research findings have the potential to contribute to the development of more accurate and reliable ASR models, which could improve human-machine communication in various applications. © 2023 SCPE.

"Construction projects exert a profound and lasting influence on the natural environment. Over the complete lifespan of buildings within the context of smart cities, there exists a dynamic interplay between these structures and the environment. This complexity introduces challenges in decision-making regarding the choice of the most optimal materials and technological solutions, leading to specific implications in subsequent phases of the project. This study adopts an analytical approach, aiming to investigate practical management issues pertaining to the construction, operation, and deconstruction of selected building types. It embraces the principles of the circular economy, aligning this construction model with the overarching concept of smart cities. The document elaborates on the concept of sustainable development, delving into the roles played by various stakeholders in the construction industry towards achieving sustainable development objectives, while also discussing associated costs, benefits, and barriers. Moreover, the text expounds on the principles underpinning the circular economy within the context of smart cities and offers a comprehensive analysis of the shift from a linear construction model to a circular one within the construction sector. Additionally, the document presents findings from an empirical study conducted to gauge the perception of sustainable construction within the Polish market, along with a presentation of its outcomes.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Negation handling is a crucial aspect of sentiment analysis, as it presents challenges to accurate sentiment classification by altering polarity and reducing reliability. Traditional lexicon-based approaches often lack adequate techniques for modeling negation and fail to identify the appropriate negation window. Moreover, building machine learning models for negation handling in conversational text data proves difficult due to the intricate syntactic structure of negation. To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised cognitive sentiment classification approach. Our research introduces the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)–based “Negation Handling of the Text Using the VIKOR Optimization Technique” (NEGVOT) model, which effectively handles negation in sentiment analysis. By employing the decision science method, the NEGVOT model provides a solution for correctly labeling text sentiment in both negation-free and negation-containing texts. Our approach utilizes a lexicon database to obtain context scores of textual comments and integrates emotional scores to achieve accurate sentiment classification. Through experiments conducted on three benchmarked datasets, we demonstrate that the NEGVOT model performs comparably to state-of-the-art models. The NEGVOT model achieves the accuracy of 83%, 85%, and 82% over three datasets. It significantly enhances the accuracy of sentiment orientation tagging by effectively handling sentences with negation. We employ statistical analysis to support the relevance of our findings. The NEGVOT paradigm ensures logical and consistent results while exhibiting a strong generalization capacity, enabling sentiment classification for texts containing negations. This study makes notable contributions to the advancement of unsupervised techniques and provides a robust framework for handling negation in sentiment classification tasks. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"This study focuses on Slovak Vojvodina drama in the last decade of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, with an emphasis on the theme of emigration as one of the important topics in current dramatic production in Serbia. It analyses dramatic texts from the collections Nová slovenská vojvodinská dráma ([New Slovak Vojvodina drama], 2004, 2014) and the journal Nový život written by Slovak author Ľubomír Šárik, Slovak Vojvodina author Jan Hrubík, and playwright Vladislava Fekete, origi-nally from Vojvodina but living in Slovakia. The authors in these dramas respond to the complex socio-political situation in Yugoslavia, particularly Serbia, in the 1990s and its subsequent impacts on the following decades, including the prominent issue of Slovak emigration from Serbia. The portrayal of the thematic and motivational layer of emigration varies in value depending on the creative potential of the author and their contextual placement.

"Introduction: Feline upper respiratory tract infection (FURTI) is a severe problem in animal shelters where there is high turnover of populations and compromised immunity. This retrospective cohort study explores associations of potential animal-based and environmental-based factors with the risk of FURTI, where a previously modelled infection classification is used as the outcome of interest. The study type is a retrospective cohort and the measures of association include Odds Ratios and conditional predictions. Objectives: To gain epidemiological insights into variation in FURTI using retrospective data from one of Australia's leading animal shelters. Methods: We stratified FURTI by admission and environmental variables. Predicted infection status, obtained using a machine-learning classifier trained on clinical text (accuracy 0.95 [CI 0.92, 0.97]), was used as the outcome of interest. Prior assumptions were represented by a causal framework or a direct acyclic graph (DAG), which informed creation of multiple Bernoulli models with an observational and prior component. Results: We analysed 43,431 feline entries over 8 years. Males were 1.24 (95% CI 1.19 to 1.31) times more likely than females to be classified as positive, while already desexed animals were only 0.68 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.72) as likely to be classified as positive compared to those not desexed on entry. Cats (>4 months) were twice as likely (95% CI 1.91 to 2.09) as kittens (0–4 months) to be classified positive. Animals entering the shelter as seized by the inspectorate (n = 415) were more likely to be classified positive compared to animals from other sources. Predicted infection probability increased in winter and showed a linear pattern with how full the shelter was. Conclusion: This study estimates the association between animal and environmental variables of interest and FURTI classification status, thus better interpreting the distribution of disease as predicted by a previously uninterpretable model. This analysis gives much needed insight into the types of changes in an animal's environment that can impact final animal outcomes. © 2023 The Authors.

"Background: Person-centred service delivery underpins current approaches to working with individuals with intellectual disabilities. We investigated views of staff from a service organisation regarding their roles in creating desired futures for adults with intellectual disabilities. Methods: Data were gathered from staff of a large organisation that provided a range of services to adults with intellectual disabilities. Respondents were asked to describe their role in assisting an individual with intellectual disability to meet their goals for the future. Responses were analysed using a text analysis programme. Results: Two major themes were identified: ‘Support for self-determination’ and ‘Business-as-usual’. These themes were not entirely separate but had some overlap. There were indications that staff experienced competing demands in their role(s). Conclusion: Although central to person-centred planning, staff who work with adults with intellectual disabilities may not see support of self-determination as a key factor in creating a desired future. © 2023 The Authors.

"This article analyses the mass media reception of Annie Ernaux’s 2022 Nobel Prize, particularly the criticisms in the French press. After the award announcement, Ernaux was at once celebrated for her feminist writing and vilified for her socio-ethnographic approach and political engagements. French journalists and critics have deemed her Nobel illegitimate, calling into question the Swedish Academy’s choice. The article probes the concept of ‘il/legitimacy’ by drawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s sociology of culture and by reading Ernaux’s award within three contexts: the history of the Nobel Prize in Literature; mass media evaluations of her works’ aesthetic value; and literary debates about the impact of authors’ politics on their candidacy to the Nobel. I argue that the legitimacy of Ernaux’s Nobel Prize is the result of a process of cultural negotiation involving authors, texts, and individual as well as institutional agents. Becoming a Nobel laureate is a lengthy process that needs to be examined in the light of all these factors. © 2023 Association for the Study of Modern and Contemporary France."
"From the perspective of a descriptive analysis, and as a starting point to a new research line, this paper examines the potential impact Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technologies may have on academic integrity, manifested in the learning and evaluation processes of law classes at the university level. The article takes as its premise the definition of academic integrity as a set of values and argues that a series of risks arise from the GAI that threaten those values, such as excessive dependence and trust in the GAI, the unreallizability of the pedagogical project and the loss of competitiveness of educational institutions, among others. To minimize or nullify such risks, and thus prevent them from affecting academic integrity, four mitigation measures are identified to be applied in university environments. © 2023 Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru.

"English social housing regulation theoretically exists to promote the social purpose of the sector, yet the success of regulation against this objective has been questioned amidst concerns with the quality of service provided by landlords. Following the Grenfell Tower fire, the government initiated a reform process to reverse a policy of regulatory passivity on consumer standards. This paper conceives of regulatory reform as a case of institutional formation; a dynamic process that shapes conduct via rules, practices and narratives. It fills an empirical gap on how regulatory practice has responded to an ambiguous institutional environment where the governmental narrative was committed to improving standards, but formal legislation lagged. Quantitative text analysis demonstrates that RSH has re-emphasised consumer standards post-Grenfell. But the process of institutional formation has been punctuated by social, political and economic crises, and the power of the regulator to enforce improved standards has been limited by legislative delays. © 2023, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Institute of Sociology.

"Just before independence, between March and May 1975, the Mozambican liberation movement FRELIMO held three meetings at its political-military training camp in Nachingwea in southern Tanzania. An estimated 360–400 “reactionary agents and traitors to the Mozambican people” were paraded and indicted in front of assembled recruits. Presidents Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia and Julius Nyerere of Tanzania attended the last meeting. During the meetings, chaired by Samora Machel, the prisoners read out public confessions. Among those prosecuted in this way were high-profile political dissidents such as Joana Simeão, Lázaro Nkavandame, Paulo Gumane, and Uria Simango. The trials of Nachingwea were the first instantiation of a politics of theatrical revolutionary violence that would characterize FRELIMO’s rule in the period after independence. After establishing a narrative of the events based on contemporary sources, this article analyses the texts of five of the confessions read at Nachingwea. Four of the latter have survived in handwritten versions, which may be the only extant copies. Based on this evidence, we argue that the Nachingwea trials were a political means to deal at once with the crisis that had shaken FRELIMO in 1968-69—often referred to as the “struggle of the two lines”—as well as to delegitimize potential political opponents in the transition to independence. © 2023 by the Board of Trustees of Boston University."
"This study explores the sneakerhead subculture through the lens of subcultural capital, primarily focusing on online community interactions. The analysis utilizes text mining techniques and netnographic research methods to examine textual data extracted from the online sneakerhead community and aims to elucidate manifestations of subcultural capital within the subculture. The findings underscore several key points: Firstly, shared experiences cultivated by the collective consciousness of subcultural capital foster solidarity among members. Secondly, ongoing validation of authenticity and comprehension of sneakers' cultural significance are member requirements. Subsequently, exhibiting greater levels of subcultural capital empowers members, resulting in hierarchical structures both within and beyond the community. Fourthly, resale-driven sneaker commercialization yields positive outcomes, including individual profit and cultural expansion, yet also brings negative consequences, such as market distortion and intra-community conflict. Lastly, the online community fills a pivotal role in dictating subcultural trends, effectively functioning as an institutional network. Given sneakers' enduring status as a fashion phenomenon, further examination of in this realm is warranted. © 2023, The Korean Society of Clothing and Textiles. All Rights Reserved."
"Drawing on real options and resource dependence theories, this study examines how firms adjust their innovation investments to address trade policy effect uncertainty (TPEU), a type of firm-specific, perceived environmental uncertainty capturing managers' difficulty in predicting the impacts of potential policy changes on business operations. To develop a context-dependent, time-varying measure of TPEU, we apply bidirectional encoder representations from transformers, an advanced deep learning technique. We analyze the texts of mandatory management discussion and analysis sections of annual reports from 3181 publicly listed Chinese firms. Our sample comprises 22,669 firm-year observations spanning the years 2007 to 2019. The econometric analyses show that firms experiencing higher TPEU will reduce innovation investments. This effect is stronger for firms facing lower competition, involving more foreign sales, and not owned by the state. These findings provide clarity on previously inconclusive results by showcasing the significant influence of policy effect uncertainty, as opposed to policy state uncertainty, on firms' decisions regarding innovation investments. Additionally, these findings underscore the importance of resource dependence factors as crucial contextual factors in this decision-making process. © 2023 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc."
"This study examines current trends and perceptions of veganism and vegan fashion in Korea, China, and the United States. Using big data tools Textom and Ucinet, we conducted cluster analysis between keywords. Further, frequency analysis using keyword extraction and CONCOR analysis obtained the following results. First, the nations’ perceptions of veganism and vegan fashion differ significantly. Korea and the United States generally share a similar understanding of vegan fashion. Second, the industrial structures, such as products and businesses, impacted how Korea perceived veganism. Third, owing to its ongoing sociopolitical tensions, the United States views veganism as an ethical consumption method that ties into activism. In contrast, China views veganism as a healthy diet rather than a lifestyle and associates it with Buddhist vegetarianism. This perception is because of their religious history and culinary culture. Fundamentally, this study is meaningful for using big data to extract keywords related to vegan fashion in Korea, China, and the United States. This study deepens our understanding of vegan fashion by comparing perceptions across nations. © 2023, The Korean Society of Clothing and Textiles. All rights reserved."
"Understanding and reading an unstructured text to answer queries on it, also called Machine Reading Comprehension (MRC), has been a hot topic amongst researchers worldwide in the past few years. There are many ways in which this problem has been tackled; each one has its perks and pitfalls. MRC is being thought about meticulously because of its various applications which are a pressing need due to ever-increasing data in this modern world. However, no work has been done focusing on the applications of MRC. We propose DeepInsight, an efficient CNN-based machine reading comprehension model inspired by QANet and an assemblage of three case studies. Each case study is about a specific application of DeepInsight, alongside the details of its implementation, results from the analysis, and shortcomings. These case studies can be referred to by developers around the world while building similar applications.The first case study is a fully implemented end-to-end android-based application that can upload documents to a server and receive different queries. Second, a mobile application that can help people with visual impairment to comprehend documents. Third, a video query application that can answer questions posed on video data, using the deep captioning model as a core for this application. DeepInsight has an EM/F1 score of 77.0 / 86.3 and performs better than the present state-of-the-art models while keeping the inference time of 0.535 seconds, justifiable for real-world applications. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"This article contributes to research into the importance of storytelling in asylum practice by examining the narratives used to promote and justify Hostile Environment policies. The two narrative practices identified are the “story of the nation-as-family”, which defines national belonging predominantly by markers of race and ethnicity, and the “story of security”, whereby racialized refugees are framed as potential threats to the nation's socio-economic stability. The former propagates a notion of consanguinity that works to exclude and silence people seeking asylum from non-European nations. The latter sees the rhetoric of a “clash of civilisations” so central to the “War on Terror” taken up in policy debates about climate-induced migration. An analysis of the way in which these stories are staged and critiqued in the writing of Abdulrazak Gurnah and Stephen Collis reveals how they elide the relationship between forced migration and the history of European colonialism. In exploring this elision, this article insists on the significance of literary texts as spaces where monocultural conceptions of belonging can be confronted, and where understanding Europe's colonial past is established as an integral part of hearing the stories of refugees in the present.

"ChatGPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) is currently the most sophisticated chatbot. It can create impressive prose in seconds, unlike other chatbots, and it has generated a lot of hype and doomsday predictions when it comes to student assessment in higher education and a variety of other topics (Rudolph et al., 2023). Nonetheless, despite its impressive capabilities, various reports on ChatGPT have consistently revealed significant remaining challenges (Bang et al., 2023). This study aims to explain the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT. A qualitative approach was conducted. In-depth interviews were used with ten key informants, employing purposive sampling. Content analysis and NVivo were utilised to analyse the data. The findings revealed that ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) tool that has the potential to revolutionise the way we communicate. This artificial intelligence (AI) technology can generate text, allowing users to easily create personalised content, and it has gained widespread popularity. However, the reaction has been mixed, with praise for its benefits and potential applications offset by criticism of its limitations and potential drawbacks. Furthermore, ChatGPT is an extremely effective tool. However, it cannot replace human thought and, if not properly fine-tuned, it has the potential to produce biased or insulting content. Thus, it is critical to bear ethical considerations in mind when implementing this technology. © 2023 The Authors."
"Alexei Balabanov’s film “Brother” is an integral part of modern Russian culture. An analysis of the audience’s reception of the film suggests that “Brother” is not just a mass action movie. A close look reveals that Balabanov’s film combines elements of pop‑culture product and in‑ tellectual cinema. The article for the first time offers a holistic analysis of the film “Brother”. Balabanov uses a complex system of repetitions at the level of a phrase, visual image, situation. This allows the author to build a complicated system of motifs that are associated with some literary traditions of classical literature. We are talking primarily about the tradition of the Petersburg text and about a complex of themes and plots that go back to romanticism. The angle from which one should look at the film is indicated by the introduction of an important character named Hoffmann, who warns the protagonist that the city is a terrible force. Motive analysis and intertextual analysis leads to the following conclusions. The plot of “Brother” can be read as a story about a young man Danila, who betrays his ideal (love of music), unable to withstand the temptation of money and power, and pays for this: he turns into his evil dop‑ pelganger — his brother Victor. The plot, seemingly tied to a specific socio‑historical reality, turns into a potentially eternal plot about a confused romantic hero who changes his ideals after falling into the mythologized space of St Petersburg that fools him. © 2023 Vestnik Sankt-Peterburgskogo Universiteta, Yazyk i Literatura."
"Objectives: This study aimed to understand how the Dobbs decision impacted graduating resident physicians in Utah and to understand residents’ perspectives on abortion access. Study design: We invited all 2023 graduating residents at the University of Utah, from all specialties, to participate in this survey. We analyzed univariate relationships between respondent demographics and change of career plans post-Dobbs. We also performed a thematic analysis of free text responses. Results: We received responses from 85 residents (55% of all graduating residents from the University of Utah) representing 19 specialties. Six (7%) residents changed their practice location due to the Dobbs decision. Most residents supported and wanted to advocate for legal abortion. In a thematic analysis, many graduating residents do not want to live in an abortion-restrictive state. Conclusions: The Dobbs decision impacts physicians across all specialties, not just obstetrician/gynecologists. Implications: Future research into the impact of the Dobbs decision should include physicians of all specialties. © 2023 The Authors"
"Recent years have seen the fast rise of technology related to the Internet. Online shopping has become an increasingly common option for people to purchase and fulfill their consumption needs. It can effectively boost consumer happiness by conducting sentiment analysis of many user evaluations on e-commerce platforms. This research proposes a new sentiment analysis model built on stacking hybrid deep learning models. In this research, we proposed a stacking technique that predicts accurately Arabic emotion by combining the prediction power of hybrid deep learning models such as RNN-BiLSTM, BiLSTM-RNN, RNN-BiGRU, BiGRU-RNN, BiGRU-BiLSTM, and BiGRU-BiLSTM with MLP word embedding. The suggested model's effectiveness is evaluated using multiple open access datasets: AHS(sub), AHS(main), AR-twitter, LARGE, OCA, OCLAR, OD, and merged datasets with 104808 items. The experiments showed that the proposed model is appropriate for assessing the feelings in texts written in the Arabic language. The first stage of the proposed strategy consists of the feature extraction employing the Arabert algorithm. Next, We create and train five hybrid deep-learning models. The subsequent step is to concatenate the outputs of the fundamental classifiers with Multilayer Perceptron. Compared to conventional and hybrid deep learning approaches, our approach achieved an accuracy improvement of 0.9668. © (2023), (International Association of Engineers). All Rights Reserved."
"Purpose: The main goal of this paper is to identify the attributes of consumer experience in Michelin-starred restaurants and to estimate their effects on restaurant ratings. Design/methodology/approach: A sample of 70,233 online reviews of 224 Spanish Michelin-starred restaurants were analysed with the latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm. A sentiment analysis and a logistic regression analysis were also employed to estimate the effect of attributes on restaurant ratings. Findings: Customer attention, food quality, decor and ambience and value for money are frequently used to define restaurant experience. However, it is shown in this study that the experience in a Michelin-starred restaurant goes beyond the evaluation of those four attributes. Furthermore, the effect of the factors that were identified on customer satisfaction differed depending on the restaurant ratings. Research limitations/implications: The findings are linked to the context of Spanish Michelin-starred restaurants. It is also assumed in this study that online reviews are based on truthful opinions. Practical implications: Restaurant managers should primarily focus on customer attention and food quality to achieve customer satisfaction. In addition, those restaurants with an error-free service and a highly appreciated wine list among diners are more likely to achieve the culinary excellence that deserves a 5-star rating on TripAdvisor. Originality/value: The attributes of the restaurant experience are frequently identified in literature reviews. Research based on text-mining analyses of customer reviews to discover a posteriori the factors that define a restaurant experience is scarce, and particularly difficult to find in the context of Michelin-starred restaurants. © 2023, Ramón Barrera-Barrera."
"Popular Secure Instant Messaging (SIM) applications like Telegram and WhatsApp have deployed state-of-the-art encryption schemes in recent years to protect the security of user communications. However, SIM applications are still not completely secure. Governments can surveil and censor users who participate in groups on sensitive topics based on the leaked information of their SIM clients. In this paper, we find two types of padding flaws in SIM applications where the padding length is not long enough, thereby exposing users' encrypted traffic characteristics. Furthermore, we first present an Active Text Traffic Analysis Attack (ATTAA) that enables the adversary to obtain sensitive information about target users' clients by merely monitoring their encrypted SIM traffic. Specifically, the adversary can quickly identify the participants of target SIM groups with high accuracy. Our study demonstrates a significant, real-world threat to SIM users due to increasing government regulation on social media. We demonstrate the practicality of our ATTAA through extensive experiments on real-world SIM communications. Although SIM applications have various restrictions on message sending, our results show that only ten text messages in 10 seconds are enough to successfully attack Telegram and WhatsApp with an accuracy of 99.94% and 98.66%, and a false positive rate of 4.3× 10-3 and 1.5× 10-4.  © 2023 IEEE."
"In the context of the accelerated development of digitalization, the rapid popularization and wide application of digital technology have become significant factors driving enterprises to participate more deeply in the division of labour. This paper examines data from 2359 A-share listed companies in China from 2010 to 2018, using a combination of machine learning text analysis and multiple regression analysis to construct a digital transformation index. Our research findings reveal that digital transformation has an inverted U-shaped effect on vertical specialization in enterprises’ division of labour. The present study examines the moderating effects of organizational inertia on the linear relationship between digital transformation and vertical specialization division of labour in enterprises. Additionally, the study explores the negative moderating effects of corporate strategic radicality on the inverted U-shaped relationship between the two variables. The findings of this study are significant as they provide a theoretical explanation for the impact mechanism of digital transformation development on the production organization mode of enterprises. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Coaches utilise augmented feedback to help channel learning and skill acquisition in sports. However, the rationale and pedagogical approaches underpinning feedback (and technology) strategies employed by coaches remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to explore cricket coaches understanding towards the role of feedback, and how feedback (and technology) strategies are enacted within practice settings, viewed within pedagogical frameworks. An online questionnaire (Qualtrics) consisted of fixed-text and free-text questions. Fixed-text responses were analysed exploring associations (frequencies, chi-square) or differences (Mann-Whitney U) between coaching groups, with free-text questions examined through reflexive thematic analysis, exploring approaches to presenting athletes with feedback (and technology use). Overall, 134 coaches (94% male, 6% female) aged 18–69 years from 12 countries responded to the questionnaire. Following silhouette and k-modes cluster analysis, results were explored for two coaching groups: community cricket coaches (n = 84, 63%) and higher-performance coaches (n = 50, 37%). Significant differences showed greater coaching experience, qualifications, and time spent coaching per week for the higher-performance coaching group (p < 0.0125), in addition to higher self-efficacy around feedback, albeit with a small effect size (p < 0.001, r = 0.29). Community coaches showed a significant difference in manipulating feedback strategies on motivational factors (p < 0.0125). Reflexive thematic analysis identified different rationales for the perceived role of feedback and use of technology across coaching groups, underpinned by contrasting pedagogical approaches (coach-centred versus athlete-centred). Responses highlighted the co-adaptive properties of coach-athlete dyads (evident in how/why feedback was manipulated). Overall findings present opportunities to further coach education to improve understanding and operationalisation of feedback (and technology). © The Author(s) 2023."
"The current study investigates citation practices in publications published in the journal Global Environmental Change. Twenty papers were selected to cover the period from 1990 to 2010. The model was applied to the selected papers, which included hundreds of in-block citations, to identify categories at different levels and compare clause- and block-level findings for each citation. The proposed model is considered a triangular system that integrates as well as aligns the chosen categories of the functions, stance, and form of citation. A comparison between the block-level analysis of citation functions and the clause-level analysis of stance categories demonstrates how citations work and their role in citation texts. By combining functional categories and stance, we gain an understanding of both conventional and unconventional patterns of citation. The article argues that starting with the block-level analysis, as a recently discovered level of analysis, is most useful for understanding students’ awareness of the block and how it affects the execution of citation practices by researchers or writers—specifically, the position of each citation. The suggested system can be extended to interdisciplinary discourse to investigate heterogeneity in citation practices. © 2023 National Communication Association."
"Background: Voluntary self-exclusion from gambling is a common but underdeveloped harm reduction tool in the management of gambling problems or gambling disorders. Large-scale, multi-operator, and operator-independent self-exclusion services are needed. A recent nationwide multi-operator self-exclusion service in Sweden (Spelpaus), involving both land- and web-based gambling sites, is promising, but recent data have revealed limitations to this system and possibilities to breach one’s self-exclusion through overseas web-based gambling. More knowledge is needed about the benefits and challenges of such an extensive self-exclusion service, and its effects as perceived by gamblers. Objective: This study protocol describes the rationale and design of a qualitative interview study addressing the effects and limitations perceived by individuals with gambling problems and their concerned significant others. The study aims to provide an in-depth experience of this novel self-exclusion service and to inform stakeholders and policymakers in order to further improve harm reduction tools against gambling problems. Methods: Individuals with gambling problems will be recruited primarily through social media and also from a treatment unit, if needed, for a qualitative interview study. Recorded interview material will be analyzed through content analysis, and recruitment will continue until saturation in the material is reached. This study will provide in-depth information about a harm reduction tool that is promising and commonly used, but which has proven to be breached by a significant number of users, potentially limiting its efficiency. The aim is to interview a sufficient number of gamblers until saturation has been obtained in the interview material. Saturation will be considered through a continuous analysis, comparing recently collected data to previously collected data. Results: Results will be reported as the themes and subthemes identified after the thorough analysis and coding of the transcribed text material and will be accompanied by citations representing relevant themes and subthemes. Results are planned to be provided before the end of 2023. Conclusions: This study will likely provide new insights into user perspectives on a multi-operator self-exclusion service that involves both web- and land-based gambling operators, and which according to previous literature attracts many gamblers but also appears to have limitations and challenges in the target group of individuals with gambling problems. Policy and legislation implications, as well as clinical implications for treatment providers, will be discussed. Results and conclusions will be disseminated to policy makers in Sweden and internationally, as well as to peer organizations, treatment providers, and the research community. © Anders Håkansson, Johanna Tjernberg, Helena Hansson."
"In modern conditions of standardization, new tasks arise, which involve the transition of international and regional standards to the digital format of ""smart"" standards that can be used as full-fledged guidelines for industrial facilities. The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning in the standardization process will increase the level of automation and allow analyzing data presented in the form of a database, which contributes to better compatibility between systems and equipment of different manufacturers. This article presents a method of ontological design, which automates partial methodological examination of documents in accordance with the National Standardization Plan. As part of the experiment, an independent tool was developed from the existing repositories of regulatory documents. This approach is based on the extraction of qualitative data from textual information using an unsupervised automatic keyword extraction algorithm. The algorithm is based on statistical characteristics of local text extracted from individual documents. The advantage of the algorithm is that it does not require the creation of a learning corpus and can be applied to any text, and also has no limitations on the volume of processed data. The following components are presented in the article: model classification standards, entity extraction module, categorization module, thesaurus generation module and monitoring and analysis module. The calculation was carried out using formalization, definition of the target function, establishment of the similarity measure, as well as description of the features of the document. The obtained results were tested, based on standards and rules in the field of the aerospace industry. © 2023, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers."

"Objective: To systematically review the effectiveness of guided telerehabilitation on improving functional performance in community-dwelling older adults. Data sources: Articles published in PubMed, Cochrane Library and Embase (Ovid) from 01 January 2010 up to 17 October 2023. Review Methods: Included studies had (1) a randomised controlled trial design, (2) an average population age of 65 years or older, (3) a home-based setting and (4) evaluated the effectiveness of functional performance outcome measures. The intervention was considered telerehabilitation when guided by a healthcare professional using video, audio and/or text communication technologies with a minimum frequency of once per week. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis 2020 statement guideline was followed. Methodological quality was appraised using the revised Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Results: A total of 26 randomised controlled trials were included. Telerehabilitation had superior (N = 15), non-superior (N = 16) or non-inferior (N = 11) effectiveness for improving functional performance outcome measures compared to control interventions. No studies found the control intervention to be superior over telerehabilitation. Between study differences in intervention characteristics contributed to significant clinical heterogeneity. Five studies were found to present an overall ‘low’ risk of bias, 12 studies to present ‘some’ risk of bias and 9 studies to present an overall ‘high’ risk of bias. Conclusion: The findings suggest that telerehabilitation could be a promising alternative to in-person rehabilitation for improving functional performance in community-dwelling older adults. Additional well-designed studies with minimised bias are needed for a better understanding of effective telerehabilitation intervention strategies. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Correction for “Cell survival following direct executioner-caspase activation,” by Maddalena Nano, James A. Mondo, Jacob Harwood, Varuzhan Balasanyan, and Denise J. Montell, which published January 20, 2023; 10.1073/pnas.2216531120 (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 120, e2216531120). The authors note: “An error has come to our attention that does not affect the conclusions in the manuscript. We analyzed caspase activity using a GFP-based sensor (GC3AI) that fluoresces when cleaved by executioner caspase (cGC3AI). We used the sensor to measure caspase activity and plotted the increase in fluorescence over time. One goal was to ask, in cells exposed to transient caspase activation, how well any measurable parameter of caspase activity predicts whether cells ultimately live or die. One parameter that we reported was the “area under the curve” (AUC) up to the point of peak GC3AI fluorescence. Although we described the AUC as the total caspase activity that a cell experienced, this interpretation is not quite right. The AUC is an appropriate measurement of total caspase activity if the sensor turns over instantaneously. At the other extreme, if the sensor does not turn over at all, the peak fluorescence is an appropriate measurement of total caspase activity. For GC3AI, the total caspase activity corresponds to a weighted sum of both the final intensity and the AUC: (Formula Presented), where I (tfinal) is the last value recorded for cGC3AI, and 1τ ∫0tfinal I(t) dt is the numerical integration of all cGC3AI values measured over time divided by the sensor lifetime τ. Assuming a half-life of cGC3AI comparable to GFP [~26 h(64)], we calculated total caspase activity. We found that, as for other parameters measured, the predictive power of total caspase activity was low (Tjur’s R2 ≤ 0.13). In cells exposed to additional phototoxic stress, the Tjur’s R2 of total caspase activity was 0.37 across conditions. Finally, a limitation of the analysis is that depletion of uncleaved GC3AI over time could lead to an underestimation of caspase activity. While this seems unlikely because the plateaus in GC3AI fluorescence correlated with decreased caspase expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D), we cannot completely rule out that substrate depletion caused underestimation of caspase activity in some cells. We thank N. P. Mitchell for helpful discussions and advice regarding calculation of total caspase activity.” As a result of the error described above, the following corrections have been made to the main text, figures, and SI Appendix. On page 3, right column, fourth full paragraph, line 1, “To assess whether total accumulated caspase activity accounts for apoptotic commitment, we measured the area under the curve (AUC) of cGC3AI in dying and surviving cells. Similar to the maximal rate, the fold change, and the timing of caspase activity, AUC was insufficient to explain cell fate choices (Fig. 4E).” should instead appear as “We also measured the area under the curve (AUC) of cGC3AI in dying and surviving cells. Similar to the maximal rate, the fold change, and the timing of caspase activity, the AUC was insufficient to explain cell fate choices (Fig. 4E). The AUC is an appropriate measurement of total caspase activity if a sensor turns over instantaneously. At the other extreme, if a sensor does not turn over at all, the peak fluorescence is an appropriate measurement of total caspase activity. For a sensor like GC3AI, total caspase activity can be calculated as a weighted sum of both cGC3AI final intensity and the AUC, where the lifetime of GC3AI determines the weight of the contribution from the AUC (Material and Methods). Like the other parameters measured, total caspase activity predictive power was low (Fig. 4 F and G; maximum Tjur’s R2 = 0.13).” On page 5, left column, first paragraph, line 7, “Consistently, we found an inversion in the logistic relationship between cell survival and AUC (compare Fig. 4E and SI Appendix, Fig. S6C). Total AUC was moderately larger in surviving cells (Fig. 4E) because they accumulated cGC3AI for longer. However, initial AUC was slightly larger in dying cells (SI Appendix, Fig. S6C), indicating that they accumulated cGC3AI faster” should be removed. On page 7, left column, fifth full paragraph, line 1, “Finally, we tested the predictive power of total caspase activity over time (Fig. 6 P–S). However, the AUC of cGC3AI predicted cell fate accurately in only ~1% of the cases across conditions (Fig. 6P). These results showed that the same total amount of caspase activity causing cell death was compatible with survival when occurring slowly over prolonged periods of time” should instead appear as “Finally, we tested the predictive power of total caspase activity over time (Fig. 6 P–S). Total caspase activity predicted cell fate in ~37% of the cases across conditions (Fig. 6P).” On page 7, left column, sixth full paragraph, line 1, “Overall, we found that the added stress of blue light illumination not only increased caspase activity but made its rate of activity and final level better predictors of cell fate (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A)” should instead appear as “Overall, we found that the added stress of blue light illumination not only increased caspase activity but made it a better predictor of cell fate (SI Appendix, Fig. S8A).” On page 7, right column, last paragraph, line 12, the sentence “On average, dying cells experience higher and faster cGC3AI accumulation, while somewhat counterintuitively, surviving cells can experience more total caspase activity, as they persist longer.” should be deleted. On page 9, left column, first paragraph, line 1, “as they persist longer” should be removed. On page 9, first paragraph, line 7, “One limitation of our experiments is that depletion of uncleaved GC3AI over time could lead to an underestimation of caspase activity. While this seems unlikely because the plateaus in GC3AI fluorescence correlated with decreased caspase expression (SI Appendix, Fig. S2D), we cannot completely rule out that substrate depletion caused underestimation of caspase activity in some cells.” should be included at the end of the paragraph. On page 10, second full paragraph, line 1, the section “Caspase Dynamics Score Calculation.” should instead be titled “Total caspase activity and caspase dynamics score calculation.” On page 10, second full paragraph, line 1, “The caspase dynamics score was calculated for each cell as follows: 1) cGC3AI maximal, time derivative maximal, and AUC were normalized as a fraction of their highest value, 2) values obtained in 1 were weighed according to the predictive power of the parameter consider (multiplied by the corresponding Tjur’s R2), and 3) a given cell was assigned a score calculated as the sum of its three weighed values.” should instead appear as “cGC3AI was measured and normalized as described in the SI Appendix, Supporting Material and Methods. Total caspase activity was calculated as (Formula Presented) is the final value of cGC3AI, and π/1 ∫0tfinal I(t) dt is the numerical integration of all cGC3AI values measured over time divided by the sensor lifetime τ. We assumed cGC3AI to have a half-life comparable to GFP (~26 h) (65). For long-term live imaging experiments (Fig. 4 F and G), we stopped our analysis at the maximum derivative since curves can plateau because of a reduction in enzyme kinetics or due to substrate depletion. For short-term, highly stressful experiments (Fig. 6 P–S), we considered all values (until the end of imaging for surviving cells, up to shrinkage for dying cells) (SI Appendix, Supporting Material and Methods). The caspase dynamics score was calculated for each cell as follows: 1) cGC3AI maximal, time derivative maximal and AUC were normalized as a fraction of their highest value, 2) values obtained in 1 were weighed according to the predictive power of the parameter considered (multiplied by the corresponding Tjur’s R2), 3) a given cell was assigned a score calculated as the sum of its three weighed values.” A reference was added to the article as a result of the changes above.

Therefore, to estimate the rate of caspase activity in each cell, we did not use the time derivative, but we ran a linear regression and calculated its slope. Since cGC3AI curves did not plateau, the AUC used for predictive analysis was calculated until the end of imaging for surviving cells, and until the moment of shrinkage for dying cells (Fig. 6 P–S and SI Appendix, Fig. S7O). To determine the predictive role of caspase activity toward cell fate determination, we ran a logistic regression between calculated values (either slope, AUC, or cGC3AI brightness) and assigned a score of 0 to surviving and a score of 1 to dying cells.” should instead appear as “In addition, in the absence of mCherry, cGC3AI fluorescence intensity underwent fluctuations that were not entirely normalized by background subtraction (mostly likely linked to slight shifts in the focal plane) and affected the derivatives. Therefore, to estimate the rate of caspase activity in each cell, we did not use the time derivative, but we ran a linear regression and calculated its slope. For the same reason, to calculate total caspase activity (Fig. 6 P–S), data were smoothed with a moving average (interval = 20), and we did not stop the analysis at the maximum derivative (surviving cells were measured for the whole duration of imaging, while dying cells were measured until shrinkage). To determine the predictive role of caspase activity toward cell fate determination, we ran a logistic regression between calculated values (either slope, cGC3AI brightness, or total caspase activity) and assigned a score of 0 to surviving and a score of 1 to dying cells.” AUC measurements are shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S7 O and P.

"This article studies the evolution of the Muslim community in China between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries from the perspective of mosque architecture. It analyses four medieval Chinese mosques with domed mihrab chambers: the Hangzhou Phoenix Mosque, the Songjiang Mosque, the Dingzhou Mosque, and the Qingyang Great North Mosque. The article focuses on the dome-roof of the mihrab chamber in these mosques, applying an art-historical approach to examine the construction methods, as well as the decorative details of the dome-roof. To explore the origin and function of the domes in these mosques, I compare them not only with local architecture but also architecture from Central Asia. Meanwhile, the historical text on building construction examines the links between the Muslim community and the transformation of the architecture. The appearance of the mosques' roofs reflects the fact that the immigrant Muslims became local Muslims under the authority and conciliation of the Ming central administration.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter."
"Background: Globally, health care systems are challenged with the shortage of health care professionals, particularly nurses. The decline in the nursing workforce is primarily attributed to an aging population, increased demand for health care services, and a shortage of qualified nurses. Stressful working conditions have also increased the physical and emotional demands and perceptions of burnout, leading to attrition among nurses. Robotics has the potential to alleviate some of the workforce challenges by augmenting and supporting nurses in their roles; however, the impact of robotics on nurses is an understudied topic, and limited literature exists. Objective: We aim to understand the extent and type of evidence in relation to robotics integration in nursing practice. Methods: The Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist will guide the scoping review. The MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), CINAHL Plus with Full Text (EBSCOhost), Scopus, Cochrane Library, and IEEE Xplore electronic bibliographic databases will be searched to retrieve papers. In addition, gray literature sources, including Google Scholar, dissertations, theses, registries, blogs, and relevant organizational websites will be searched. Furthermore, the reference lists of included studies retrieved from the databases and the gray literature will be hand-searched to ensure relevant papers are not missed. In total, 2 reviewers will independently screen retrieve papers at each stage of the screening process and independently extract data from the included studies. A third reviewer will be consulted to help decision-making if conflicts arise. Data analysis will be completed using both descriptive statistics and content analysis. The results will be presented using tabular and narrative formats. Results: The review is expected to describe the current evidence on the integration and impact of robots and robotics into nursing clinical practice, provide insights into the current state and knowledge gaps, identify a direction for future research, and inform policy and practice. The authors expect to begin the data searches in late January 2024. Conclusions: The robotics industry is evolving rapidly, providing different solutions that promise to revamp health care delivery with possible improvements to nursing practice. This review protocol outlines the steps proposed to systematically investigate this topic and provides an opportunity for more insights from scholars and researchers working in the field. © Elizabeth Mirekuwaa Darko, Manal Kleib, Gillian Lemermeyer, Mahdi Tavakoli."
"Digital labour platforms have become increasingly common for the trade of a range of digitally transferable services. To help participants mitigate the uncertainty that is inherent to trading on digital platforms, feedback mechanisms have become the main tool to gauge the ‘performed’ quality and reliability of platform participants. Based on an analysis of 750 written feedback texts, this article first examines which freelancer qualities (technical skills, generic skills or personal competences) matter most to clients and, therefore, are instrumental to the building of a freelancer’s digital reputation on a platform and, second, how exactly these feedback texts help reduce uncertainty when trading via a platform. Herewith, this paper adds to a deeper understanding of the ‘rules of the game’ on digital labour platforms. © 2023 Pluto Journals. All rights reserved."
"Background: Word-to-text integration (WTI) can be challenging for second-language (L2) learners, although it can positively contribute to reading comprehension. The present study examined the role of WTI, after controlling for decoding, vocabulary and morphosyntactic awareness, in predicting English as an L2 reading comprehension development in 441 Dutch seventh-grade students. Methods: At the beginning (Time 1 [T1]) and the end (Time 2 [T2]) of the school year, students were tested on their English decoding, vocabulary, morphological and syntactic awareness and reading comprehension with paper-and-pencil tasks and on WTI with a self-paced reading task with reading times being compared on passages with unknown versus known words and passages with and without anomalies. Results: Mediation analyses showed small indirect effects of processing argument overlap and anomalies on T2 reading comprehension, via T1 reading comprehension. Conclusions: WTI explained unique variance in reading comprehension at T2 via reading comprehension at T1, suggesting that it moderately impacts initial stages of reading comprehension in English as a second language (ESL). © 2023 The Authors.

"Nicholas Adams argues that one should not force the articulation of moral common ground as this might lead to a distortion or collapse of what is being articulated. Instead, one should strive for an articulation as practised in Scriptural Reasoning, where the common ground remains implicit and interwoven with contextual understandings. These arguments concern the question of what language can do. Following Walter Benjamin, I would like to link the question of what language can or cannot do more closely to an analysis of what language is. Referring to a certain potential of language, I will argue with Benjamin that linguistic creations can serve the value of Scriptural Reasoning to engage in a fruitful conversation about moral matters. In this context, I will consider the question of whether only sacred texts are suitable for Scriptural Reasoning. © 2023 International Journal of Philosophy and Theology."
"While female actors frequently play male parts and several actors of color have now played lead roles at well-funded Shakespeare theaters, to date no female or male transgender actor has had any similar level of visibility: none of the Shakespeare productions of the National Theatre, Shakespeare’s Globe, Stratford Festival, or Oregon Shakespeare Festival has cast a self-identifying transgender actor in a lead role. The Globe, when still under the direction of Emma Rice, cast several performers who are notable for performing in drag, but drag and transgender are not equivalent. Across dozens of recent productions no transgender performer has ever performed on any of these highly visible stages. Historically, however, there is evidence that people we might now consider nonbinary or transgender did appear on early modern stages in highly visible ways. José Esteban Muñoz has theorized potentiality as an already ontologically present queer reality: potentiality does not occur in an always deferred futurity—it is instead already present in the queer here and now, even if it only exists at the edges of our vision. What happens when we stop thinking of early modern “crossdressing” through the assumption of cisgendered actors and instead imagine the possibility of Shakespeare for and by nonbinary and transgender actors and spectators? This chapter analyses several recent UK productions in order to explore which kinds of access are and are not present in Shakespearean texts and how they can be approached and adapted to be more inclusive of the needs and interests of nonbinary and transgender actors and audiences. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023."
"Background: Stroke is a significant medical condition, and blood pressure stands out as the most prevalent treatable risk factor associated with it. Researches link blood pressure variability (BPV) with stroke; however, the specific relationship between with the outcomes of stroke patients remains unclear. As blood pressure variability and mean blood pressure are interrelated, it remains uncertain whether BPV adds additional information to understanding the outcome of acute stroke patients. Objective: To systematically review studies investigating the association between blood pressure variability and prognosis in acute stroke patients. Methods: Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were searched for English language full-text articles from the inception to 1 January 2023. Stroke patients aged ≥ 18 years were included in this analysis. Stroke types were not restricted. Results: This meta-analysis shows that higher systolic blood pressure variability is linked to a higher risk of poor outcome, including function disability, mortality, early neurological deterioration, and stroke recurrence, among acute stroke patients without thrombolysis. A higher diastolic blood pressure variability is linked with to a higher risk of mortality and functional disability. Conclusions: This review reveals that blood pressure variability is a novel and clinically relevant risk factor for stroke patients’ outcome. Future studies should investigate how best to measure and define BPV in acute stroke. Larger studies are warranted to provide more robust evidence in this area. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany."
"The Securities and Exchange Commission requires the disclosure of changes to or waivers of corporate codes of ethics. Because the nature of amendments or waivers can vary, we expect the text of Item 5.05 to include different topics within different filings. We examine the population of these disclosures in Item 5.05 8-K filings from 2004 to 2020. While previous studies utilized small samples (fewer than 50 observations) to examine limited aspects of these filings, we use the population of these filings from 2004 to 2020 (2121 8-K filings) to elucidate the nature and details of the disclosures. We assess whether Latent Dirichlet Allocation—a computational linguistics technique—can help discern the underlying topics represented in filings. While the Securities and Exchange Commission identifies two topics—amendments and waivers—the Latent Dirichlet Allocation analysis reveals four topics (three related to amendments): (1) code updates and clarifications; (2) combining codes of conduct for all officers and employees, or splitting codes to include a code directly applicable to senior financial officers; (3) codes of ethics waivers; and (4) substantive code changes. The overall trend is for fewer 8-Ks to be filed in recent years, with updates and clarifications becoming the predominant filing type. Our results further indicate that Item 5.05s related to updates and clarifications, and those related to combined or split codes, use fewer words and are more easily readable than those disclosing waivers or material code changes. Although we find no significant price reaction to Item 5.05 8-K filings, we find significant trading volume and volatility reactions, suggesting that these disclosures could give rise to differences in opinion among investors, which is consistent with the US Senate's assertion that these disclosures are of interest to investors. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"This study investigated the academic burnout experiences of staff at various universities in Malaysia. Qualitative content analysis was used to deconstruct the interview texts. The study involved n = 12 academics (ages 28–46) from several Malaysian higher education institutions. The key findings of this study centre on resilience, engagement and burnout. Eight themes were found: warning indicators of burnout, academic burnout triggers, coping strategies, work-life balance, love for the career, resilience and surviving in academia, the impact of burnout phases on oneself, and stress-inducing variables. The themes were connected to the academics’ unique experiences with the burnout phenomenon and problems in their current profession. Data from interviews revealed that most academics considered their work taxing and blamed issues like unmanageable workloads, excessive university requirements and a lack of resources for their burnout episodes. The results also demonstrate that academics were aware of the difficulties and institutional circumstances that add to the complexity of their day-to-day burnout experiences, offering a rich picture of their individual perspectives. Furthermore, individuals with specific personality types, such as perfectionistic traits or standards, tend to be more vulnerable to burnout. The results imply that for academics who experience burnout, relevant interventions and emotional support are essential and that the most resilient are those who maintain a positive attitude and have the capacity to cope with the challenges and responsibilities of an academic profession. © Authors This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0."
"The psychological attributes of business angels are an important but understudied determinant of business angels’ investment behaviour. We derive hypotheses on how psychological attributes (i.e. clout, risk-taking, analytical thinking) affect business angels’ investments in successful portfolio ventures. Our theorized mechanisms draw on cognitive biases (i.e. overconfidence bias, loss-aversion bias, confirmation bias) to explain how business angels’ psychological attributes could affect their selection of portfolio ventures. Empirically, we perform a language-based text analysis using Twitter data to gain insights into the psychological attributes of 1511 US business angels who made 5209 investments. Our results show that the psychological attributes of clout, risk-taking and analytical thinking can indeed affect business angels’ likelihood of investing in portfolio ventures that successfully acquire follow-on funding, highlighting the importance of psychological attributes in business angel investments. © 2023 British Academy of Management."
"Many narratives circulate around the translation of the Qur’an, but perhaps the most tenacious one concerns the sacred book’s (un)translatability. While certainly relevant to discussions of Qur’an translation, the issue of (un)translatability seems, however, to be paid a disproportionate and unwarranted level of attention in mainstream translation studies literature on the subject. This dynamic is at least partly informed by entrenched Eurocentric narratives about translation and the text of the Qur’an, especially as it relates to the Bible. This article explores Qur’anic (un)translatability by presenting the results of a thematic meta-analysis of articles on Qur’an translation that appear in two major translation studies bibliographic databases (BITRA and TSB). It lays out some recurrent themes in Qur’an translation scholarship and highlights the stubborn presence of the issue of (un)translatability. The article also identifies the Eurocentric narratives and value judgements that may well underlie and explain some of this presence. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Communication research frequently applies computational text analysis methods (CTAM) to detect and measure social science constructs. However, the validity of these measures can be difficult to assess. In addition, there are hardly any established standards and little guidance for researchers on how to best validate CTAM. But how do these challenges affect current validation practices in applied research? And what practical recommendations for better validation of text-based measures can we derive? To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of current validation practices and qualitative expert interviews. We focused on political communication, a subfield that has arguably played a pioneering role in embracing the application of CTAM in communication research. Our results show that researchers apply a great variety of validation steps, which, however, are rarely selected based on a unified understanding of validity. The qualitative interviews further reinforce this notion, as interviewees bemoan a lack of established guidelines and frameworks for validation. Based on our empirical findings, we then derive practical recommendations to guide researchers on how to approach validation conceptually. Additionally, we provide insight into ongoing research that focuses on applied validation frameworks, designed to provide hands-on guidance to researchers involved in CTAM validation. © 2023 The Author(s).

"To understand the concept of dignity in care and use it in practice, nurses need a clear understanding of the dignity of patients, which can help them improve quality of care and provide services of a higher standard. This study aims to clarify the concept of human dignity of patients in nursing. Walker and Avant’s method (2011) was used for this concept analysis. Published literature from 2010 to 2020 was identified using national and international databases. The full text of the included articles was reviewed. The main dimensions and attributes include valuing the patient, respecting patients’ privacy, autonomy, and confidentiality, having a positive mental image, having a sense of altruism, respecting human equality, observing patients’ beliefs and rights, adequately educating patients, and paying attention to secondary caregivers. Nurses should consider the subjective and objective aspects of dignity in their daily care activities by cultivating a deeper understanding of the concept of dignity and its attributes. In this regard, nursing tutors, managers, and policymakers in healthcare should emphasise human dignity in nursing. © Indian Journal of Medical Ethics 2022"
"Background: Early identification of mental disorder symptoms is crucial for timely treatment and reduction of recurring symptoms and disabilities. A tool to help individuals recognize warning signs is important. We posit that such a tool would have to rely on longitudinal analysis of patterns and trends in the individual's daily activities and mood, which can now be captured through data from wearable activity trackers, speech recordings from mobile devices, and the individual's own description of their mental state. In this paper, we describe such a tool developed by our team to detect early signs of depression, anxiety, and stress. Objective: This study aims to examine three questions about the effectiveness of machine learning models constructed based on multimodal data from wearables, speech, and self-reports: (1) How does speech about issues of personal context differ from speech while reading a neutral text, what type of speech data are more helpful in detecting mental health indicators, and how is the quality of the machine learning models influenced by multilanguage data? (2) Does accuracy improve with longitudinal data collection and how, and what are the most important features? and (3) How do personalized machine learning models compare against population-level models? Methods: We collect longitudinal data to aid machine learning in accurately identifying patterns of mental disorder symptoms. We developed an app that collects voice, physiological, and activity data. Physiological and activity data are provided by a variety of off-the-shelf fitness trackers, that record steps, active minutes, duration of sleeping stages (rapid eye movement, deep, and light sleep), calories consumed, distance walked, heart rate, and speed. We also collect voice recordings of users reading specific texts and answering open-ended questions chosen randomly from a set of questions without repetition. Finally, the app collects users' answers to the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. The collected data from wearable devices and voice recordings will be used to train machine learning models to predict the levels of anxiety, stress, and depression in participants. Results: The study is ongoing, and data collection will be completed by November 2023. We expect to recruit at least 50 participants attending 2 major universities (in Canada and Mexico) fluent in English or Spanish. The study will include participants aged between 18 and 35 years, with no communication disorders, acute neurological diseases, or history of brain damage. Data collection complied with ethical and privacy requirements. Conclusions: The study aims to advance personalized machine learning for mental health; generate a data set to predict Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale results; and deploy a framework for early detection of depression, anxiety, and stress. Our long-term goal is to develop a noninvasive and objective method for collecting mental health data and promptly detecting mental disorder symptoms. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, there is an increasing number of industries relying on the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning algorithms. But due to the inexplicability and black box effect of deep neural networks, we can only obtain results without knowing the applied reasoning behind them. That engenders scepticism and resistance from some quarters of deep learning-based technologies. In the context of emotion analysis used in business and public opinion monitoring, it is sometimes difficult for decision-makers to trust the outcome without explanation from the supposedly emotionless machines. There are mathematical-based explanation methods, and they often generalise emotion analysis as a classification task. Still, emotion should be different from other task categories because the generation of emotion involves human-specific factors and logic. This paper proposes an emotion analysis explanation framework that is grounded in psychological theories focusing on the stimulus from classic emotion theories. This proposed framework emphasises considering the cause and trigger of emotions as the explanation for the deep learning-based emotion analysis, and it includes two main components: the extraction of the emotion cause and the visualisation of emotion-triggering words. Compared with the existing approaches, our proposed framework is based on the perspective of human psychology with higher credibility and significant theoretical support. In addition, we purposefully design and implement an intuitive visualisation for the framework, instead of complex numerical representations, to improve the explanation comprehensibility for a broader audience. © 2023"
"Dysphagia affects individuals across all ages and has pervasive and potentially life-threatening consequences. Individuals with dysphagia are assessed and treated by speech and language therapists (SLTs), however, little attention has been paid to their practices in Pakistan. This study aimed to explore SLTs practices for dysphagia assessment, signs and symptoms observed during evaluation, and management strategies, alongside barriers and facilitators to service delivery in Pakistan. A 45-item survey was distributed to SLTs online. Responses were received from 101 participants and analyzed descriptively, and open-text responses were analyzed using content analysis. Results revealed that 65.3% SLTs worked across the lifespan, and most (79.4%) had dysphagia-related experience of five years or less. SLTs were an active workforce engaged with varying ages, disorders, and settings, yet dysphagia contributed to a small caseload percentage for most. Analyses found informal clinical exams were more frequently used than instrumental assessments. A variety of service provision facilitators were described, such as supportive teams and accessible resources, and responses about barriers revealed gaps in awareness, education, and guidance. This exploratory study presents novel and unexplored data which provides a deeper understanding of dysphagia-related care in Pakistan. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"Standardization and technical regulation involve the digitization of international and regional standards into “smart” standards, introducing new requirements for the presentation of complex industrial manuals. The introduction of artificial intelligence and machine learning into the process of standardization, improving process automation, data analysis will provide an opportunity to create innovative standards. Creation of machine-readable standards and their presentation in the form of a database will contribute to better interoperability between systems. The article demonstrates the method of ontological engineering for the automation of partial methodological examination of documents in accordance with the National Standardization Plan. As part of the experiment, an independent tool was developed, based on the extraction of qualitative data, using an uncontrolled automatic keyword extraction algorithm. The algorithm does not require the creation of a learning corpus, can be applied to any text and language, and does not have limitations on the amount of processed data. The algorithm provides adjustment of the parameters of the repetition of keywords, with the possibility of taking into account less important keywords. The work presents the following components: model classification standards, essence extraction module, categorization, thesaurus formation, monitoring and analysis. Calculations were carried out using formalization, determination of the target function, establishment of similarity measures, and description of document features. The work presents the theoretical aspect of application, design and description of the functional system. Copyright © 2023, Authors.

"The application of NLP to the field of customer service has the potential to significantly raise levels of satisfaction among users and revenue generated from those users. Among the many applications of natural language processing in customer service discussed in this article are sentiment analysis, text categorization, and language creation. With the use of sentiment analysis, businesses may gauge the tone of a customer's feedback and tailor their response appropriately. Automatically forwarding customer service enquiries to the correct team is a viable use case for text categorization. Through the use of language generation, answers to commonly requested queries may be generated mechanically.Furthermore, the article delves into the economic gains that may result from using NLP in the service sector. Some examples of these advantages include reduced spending on administrative activities as a result of automating them, and an increase in sales as a result of happier customers. The necessity for extensive volumes of training data and the possibility of bias in the algorithms are two of the main obstacles and concerns for adopting NLP in customer service that are discussed in the article.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Empirical research has shown that poor comprehenders use reading strategies less frequently than good comprehenders. Moreover, poor comprehenders tend to use simple strategies (e.g. slowing down reading when the text is hard to understand) instead of using more complex strategies (e.g. choosing between main and trivial information). The present study aimed to analyse the reading strategies used by poor (n = 37) and good comprehenders n = 141) in a sample of fifth grade Portuguese students. Results from multivariate analysis of covariance showed statistically significant differences in the use of reading strategies between the two subgroups of students, after controlling for the vocabulary. Specifically, good comprehenders reported to use significantly more strategies such as selecting relevant ideas, reviewing the text, evaluating comprehension after reading, forming pictures in mind and rereading parts of the text that are difficult to understand. Thus, the results suggested that good and poor comprehenders differed mainly in the use of more sophisticated cognitive and metacognitive strategies. © 2023 Learning Difficulties Australia."
"The primary objective of the article is to evaluate the significance of status and allied reputation within Denmark’s strategic culture. Amongst Danish international relations scholars, there is a well-established notion that one of the key motivations for the use of military force in Danish foreign policy was the aspiration to cultivate special relations with the United States and achieve the status of a privileged ally. This status would confirm guarantees for Denmark’s national security, provide the country with an opportunity for distinctive influence in decision-making and agenda-setting in NATO, the EU, and transatlantic cooperation. A qualitative content analysis of the 2017—2018, 2019—2020 and 2022 Danish foreign policy strategies was carried out to determine the effect of such expert perceptions on the texts of the guiding foreign policy documents. The analysis highlighted and confirmed the ‘super Atlanticism’ tendencies in Denmark’s contemporary strategic culture, revealing its close ties with the Danish perception of the US as the safeguard for the liberal world order and associated multilateral institutions. Denmark’s value-driven militarised foreign political activism in the post-Cold War era is thus not only pragmatic but also ideological as it seeks to promote liberal values, democracy and human rights under American leadership. The article concludes that factoring in status and reputation in strategic culture studies may complement the explanations of security community formation, alliance strategies and the dynamics behind relations within different types of alliances. © Belukhin, N.

"In his 1676 text De Quadratura Arithmetica, Leibniz distinguished infinita terminata from infinita interminata.The text also deals with the notion, originating with Desargues,of the point of intersection at infinite distance for parallel lines.We examine contrasting interpretations of these notions in the context of Leibniz’s analysis of asymptotes for logarithmic curves and hyperbolas. We point out difficulties that arise due to conflating these notions of infinity. As noted by Rodríguez Hurtado et al., a significant difference exists between the Cartesian model of magnitudes and Leibniz’s search for a qualitative model for studying perspective,including ideal points at infinity.We show how respecting the distinction between these notions enables a consistent interpretation thereof. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"This study investigates a lexical type of Spanish nouns that are characterized by a high degree of genericity and a great condensing capacity, features that can convert them into textual cohesion resources, frequently used in many specific discourses. The condensing function of general nouns, consisting in encapsulating a predicative content, can be reinforced by some desired discursive effect on the part of the author who can impose to the reader a particular assessment of the facts described in the text. Our goal is to measure the contribution of nominal encapsulators to the cohesion of scientific texts and their specific discursive character, supposedly objective and depersonalized. Starting from its six semantic classes proposed by Schmid (2000), we subject to an empirical analysis our manual corpus composed of texts from various scientific disciplines, in order to establish some variables: distribution of the encapsulators in the generic subtypes of the corpus and in all parts of the text. © The Author(s).

"Decidual transformation of the endometrium is the final stage of the cyclic endometrial transformation during pregnancy. The morphogenesis of endometrial transformation is represented by clearly coordinated hormone-receptor interactions via immunological, angiogenic, and apoptotic factors that are necessary for pregnancy development. The pathology of morphogenesis can cause implantation disorders and early reproductive losses, highlighting the medical and social relevance of this issue. The aim of this review was to analyze the literature data on the morphogenesis of endometrial transformation in the first trimester of pregnancy. Open access full-text publications from the PubMed and eLibrary databases, as well as Russian relevant journals from 1999 to 2021 were used for the analysis. The morphogenesis of endometrial transformation in the first trimester of pregnancy is determined by cyclic endometrial transformation adequacy and the optimal endometrium-embryo interaction under the influence of many factors. The complex approach in evaluation of multiple links in the morphogenesis of decidual transformation of the endometrium (steroidogenesis, immunogenesis, angiogenesis, and apoptosis) will reveal molecular mechanisms of pregnancy termination due to altered decidual membrane formation. The fundamental value of molecular mechanisms underlying endometrial transformation in understanding the pathogenesis of reproductive failures dictates the necessity of endometrial transformation investigation under conditions of reprogramming and remodeling during pregnancy. © Eco-Vector, 2023."
"Background: Health anxiety (HA) by proxy is described as parents’ obsessive worries that their child is severely ill although this is not medically confirmed. Research on HA by proxy suggests that it is highly distressing for the parent and that the child may be at risk of developing maladaptive symptom coping strategies. No targeted treatment for this group exists. We developed PROXY, an 8-week psychological internet-delivered treatment for parents with HA by proxy. The treatment components of PROXY are informed by cognitive behavioral therapy as well as acceptance and commitment therapy, and it was developed in collaboration with parents experiencing HA by proxy and clinical experts. Objective: This paper describes the protocol for a study investigating the potential effects of PROXY on parents’ worries about their children’s health using a single-case experimental design (SCED). Methods: Five parents clinically evaluated as experiencing HA by proxy will be included. A replicated randomized SCED study will be conducted in which each participant will be randomized to receive treatment after a baseline period of between 7 and 26 days (phase A). The treatment phase duration is 8 weeks for all participants (phase B), followed by a follow-up phase lasting between 14 and 33 days (phase C), ensuring that all participants remain in the study for 96 days. Participants will report daily anxiety level by SMS text message throughout the study. They will also answer self-report questionnaires, including questions on HA by proxy and own HA, 4 times during the study. Data will be submitted to structured visual analysis to inspect anxiety level, the variability of anxiety, trends, the overlap of data points among phases, when effects occur, and the consistency of data patterns across participants. Furthermore, randomization tests will be conducted for each participant to test the null hypothesis that PROXY will have no effect on participants’ anxiety. Results: The recruitment of parents began in June 2022. As of March 2, 2023, a total of 4 parents have been included in the study. Data collection was expected to cease in April 2023. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this protocol describes the only study of treatment for HA by proxy. As the prevalence of this condition is still unknown, a SCED was chosen because this method allows the inclusion of very few participants while still providing information on effects and treatment courses. Conducting the study with a replicated randomized phase design enables methodologically sound testing despite the inclusion of very few participants. The results will inform researchers on individual treatment courses and effects, which may direct future research in terms of the possible mechanisms of change, ideas for how to refine the treatment content, and how the treatment may be offered to patients in the future. ©Katrine Ingeman, Lisbeth Frostholm, Kaare Bro Wellnitz, Kristi Wright, Ditte Hoffmann Frydendal, Patrick Onghena, Charlotte Ulrikka Rask."
"Layout analysis is the first step in automatic grading and other OCR tasks. Although various layout analysis technologies have been developed for different application scenarios, existing approaches still have difficulty in achieving high accuracy on answer sheet analysis. By combining the deep neural network object detection model YOLOv5s and traditional text extraction methods, a layout analysis method for answer sheets is proposed in this paper. The foreground and background of aligned answer sheets are separated by a method that we propose based on the variation in the pixel gradient. Then, a YOLOv5s-DC model is trained to detect the handwriting texts in the answer sheets, and MSER (Maximally Stable Extremal Regions) is applied to the answer sheets to extract the missing parts and background texts. The decoupled YOLO head replaces the original YOLO head for higher performance. Quality focal loss and efficient IoU loss are employed during loss calculation to supervise the classification and regression, respectively. After the detection, the seam carving algorithm and other rules are applied to the bounding boxes to improve the extraction results. The mean average precision of YOLOv5s-DC is 91.6%, which is 3.2% higher than that of YOLOv5s. The pixel accuracy of our text extraction method is 99.92%. The experimental results verify that our method can effectively and accurately analyze the layout of answer sheets. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature."
"Background: Increased use of eHealth technology and user data to drive early identification and intervention algorithms in early psychosis (EP) necessitates the implementation of ethical data use practices to increase user acceptability and trust. Objective: First, the study explored EP community partner perspectives on data sharing best practices, including beliefs, attitudes, and preferences for ethical data sharing and how best to present end-user license agreements (EULAs). Second, we present a test case of adopting a user-centered design approach to develop a EULA protocol consistent with community partner perspectives and priorities. Methods: We conducted an exploratory, qualitative, and focus group–based study exploring mental health data sharing and privacy preferences among individuals involved in delivering or receiving EP care within the California Early Psychosis Intervention Network. Key themes were identified through a content analysis of focus group transcripts. Additionally, we conducted workshops using a user-centered design approach to develop a EULA that addresses participant priorities. Results: In total, 24 participants took part in the study (14 EP providers, 6 clients, and 4 family members). Participants reported being receptive to data sharing despite being acutely aware of widespread third-party sharing across digital domains, the risk of breaches, and motives hidden in the legal language of EULAs. Consequently, they reported feeling a loss of control and a lack of protection over their data. Participants indicated these concerns could be mitigated through user-level control for data sharing with third parties and an understandable, transparent EULA, including multiple presentation modalities, text at no more than an eighth-grade reading level, and a clear definition of key terms. These findings were successfully integrated into the development of a EULA and data opt-in process that resulted in 88.1% (421/478) of clients who reviewed the video agreeing to share data. Conclusions: Many of the factors considered pertinent to informing data sharing practices in a mental health setting are consistent among clients, family members, and providers delivering or receiving EP care. These community partners’ priorities can be successfully incorporated into developing EULA practices that can lead to high voluntary data sharing rates. © Laura M Tully, Kathleen E Nye, Sabrina Ereshefsky, Valerie L Tryon, Christopher Komei Hakusui, Mark Savill, Tara A Niendam."
"Quantifying how colours stimulate animal eyes is an essential first step in many areas of biology, from behavioural and visual ecology to neuroethology. Although multiple methods exist, their relative accuracies remain untested, leaving researchers unsure which methods are most accurate and which might be unacceptably inaccurate. Here, I compare measurements from reflectance spectrometry and four camera-based techniques to ground-truth spectroradiometric measurements of radiance, using eight diverse visual systems. Because errors may compound through successive calculations, I calculate not only relative quantum catches but also chroma and colour contrasts. I find that filters mimicking photoreceptor spectral sensitivity curves, through either custom fabrication or weighted additive combinations of bandpass filters (‘computational filters’), as well as reflectance spectrometry, are the most accurate techniques, with most R2 > 0.98. Statistical filters trained on the library of reflectance spectra in the multispectral image calibration and analysis (MICA) toolbox lag behind in accuracy, particularly for dark colours, with R2 values dipping as low as 0.23. However, the performance of these filters is vastly improved (all R2 > 0.96) if one (a) uses the full UV–VIS range of camera and animal vision, even for animals lacking UV photoreceptors and (b) expands the library of training spectra to include simulated low-reflectance spectra. Statistical filters trained on either a 24- or 45-colour chart (an alternative method offered by the MICA toolbox) vary wildly in accuracy, with R2 values ranging from 0.11 to 0.94, and should not be trusted. For those requiring point measurements only, reflectance spectrometry is highly accurate within the constraints described in the main text. Those using photography and desiring the highest levels of accuracy should opt for custom-fabricated or computational filters. Statistical filters trained on the MICA toolbox's library of natural spectra can be expected to be reasonably accurate for many combinations of visual systems and stimuli, but only if (a) the full UV–VIS spectrum is used and (b) the training library is expanded to include simulated low-reflectance spectra. Statistical filters trained on a colour chart are highly unreliable and their use should be discontinued. © 2023 The Authors.

"This article analyzes the production of the anthropological narrative about Mapuche society represented in four scientifi c papers by two Chilean anthropologists in the 1980s and 1990s: Teresa Durán and Rolf Foerster. It is interesting to know the modes of representation of the Mapuche present in anthropological texts, considering some theoretical perspectives associated with the category of author, anthropological writing, and representation. Th e study follows the guidelines of qualitative content analysis, which allows identifying the topics of interest studied by the authors and the typologies of “study subjects” observed and refl ected in their texts. On the one hand, research allows to defi ne a temporal and contextual variation in the approaches of both authors and, secondly, to identify two distinct ways of approach and representation of the Mapuche, which makes possible to speak of two styles of anthropology that cross the anthropological production in Chile. © (2023), (Universidad de Concepcion).

"Background: With the release of the text revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition (DSM-5-TR), criteria for Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) were included. This necessitates studying grief trajectories based on these criteria. Objective: This is the first study examining latent trajectories of DSM-5-TR-based PGD symptom levels and testing whether specific risk factors (e.g. cause of death) predicted PGD trajectories. Method: We evaluated latent DSM-5-TR PGD trajectories using pooled existing data collected at 6–12, 13–24, and 25–60 months post-loss in Danish and Dutch bereaved adults (N = 398). Latent Growth Mixture Modelling (LGMM) was employed to determine the trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to examine which risk factors predicted class membership. Results: The four-class LGMM solution with a quadratic term was best-fitting the data. This solution represented four trajectories: High stable PGD (6%), High PGD quick recovery (10%), High PGD slow recovery (35%), and Low PGD symptoms (49%). Participants with a higher educational level were more likely to be assigned to the Low PGD symptoms trajectory compared to High stable PGD and High PGD slow recovery trajectories. Unnatural causes of death increased the likelihood of being in the High stable PGD and High PGD slow recovery trajectories compared to the Low PGD symptoms trajectory. Conclusions: Consistent with prior research, the Low PGD symptoms trajectory was the most common. A significant minority experienced high and stable levels of PGD within five years after the loss. About one-third of participants experienced high acute grief levels that decreased slowly; how slow decreasing symptoms relate to an individual’s functioning requires further attention. This study demonstrates that a significant minority of bereaved people develop acute PGD symptomatology that does not diminish within five years post-loss, emphasizing the need for early screening for PGD to prevent long-lasting complaints. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Background: Deterioration in cognitive function is common among cancer survivors undergoing treatment. These problems may persist for several years after completion of treatment and can adversely affect cancer survivors' treatment adherence and quality of life. The cause of cognitive changes in cancer survivors is unclear, although it is likely a complex interaction of disease-related, treatment-related, and psychological factors. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are one promising intervention for cancer survivors to alleviate unwanted and burdensome side effects, including disruptions in cognitive function. The aim of the current review was to synthesize the literature on MBIs and cognitive function in cancer survivors. Methods: We searched five databases from inception on May 27, 2021 (original search), and May 4, 2022 (updated search): PubMed, MEDLINE Ovid, EMBASE Ovid, PsycInfo Ovid, CINAHL EBSCO, and Web of Science. Articles were screened at the abstract and full-Text level by two reviewers. Results: A total of 1916 records were retrieved, and 24 unique studies met the inclusion criteria. There was significant variability across studies regarding type of MBIs investigated, types of cognitive outcome measures used, and study assessment timelines. Eleven studies were included in a meta-Analysis of self-reported cognitive function, significantly favoring MBIs over inactive controls (ie, usual care) (standardized mean difference = 0.86; 95% confidence interval = 0.32-1.41). A similar model, including four studies, compared MBIs with active controls (ie, music listening, metacognition treatment, fatigue education and support, walking program); this model also demonstrated a statistically significant pooled effect (standardized mean difference = 0.61; 95% confidence interval = 0.23-0.99). Owing to a small number of studies, meta-Analysis could not be completed for objectively assessed cognitive function; a narrative summary for this outcome revealed mixed results. Conclusions: MBIs demonstrated evidence for improving cognitive function among cancer survivors and particularly self-reported cognitive function. However, most studies demonstrated a high risk of bias and significant concerns regarding study quality. Further research is needed to determine the effects of MBIs on both self-reported and objectively assessed cognitive function for cancer survivors, as well as optimal intervention structure and timing.

"Supercritical carbon dioxide (SCO2) has the advantages of high thermal efficiency and compact layout in applications due to its excellent transport properties and lower critical point (pcr = 7.38 MPa, Tcr = 30.98 ℃). It can be considered as a modelling fluid instead of water for due to significantly lower critical parameters. This paper concentrates on the thermal-hydraulic characteristic of SCO2 in tube to provide a reliable database for future verification. An experimental loop was designed and constructed for SCO2 recently. Detailed component description and parameter information are described in the text. The designed maximum pressure and temperature of the system are 15 MPa and 200 °C, respectively, accompanied with circulating mass flux of 0-22 L/min in the loop. Calibrations and uncertainty analysis has been made before experimental tests. Preliminary experiments were carried out to collect heat-transfer data at three pressures above the critical point (7.6, 8.4 and 9.5 MPa), mass fluxes from 200 to 1000 kg/m2s, heat fluxes up to 300 kW/m2 and inlet temperatures from 20 to 40ºC. The results are used to verify previous data and scaling laws. © 2023 by JSME."
"Ever-present mass surveillance has blocked the flourishing of a traditional dissident culture in Turkey. Focusing on popular ‘just for fun’ Instagram accounts during the lira's freefall that began in the autumn of 2021, this study seeks to identify the creative strategies for digital social resistance embedded in multimodal content sharing of posts, which are composed of visuals, text, and sound. For this, we employed a multimodal-type analysis of Instagram posts regarding Turkey's economic crisis, followed by an interpretative content analysis aiming to (1) identify, categorize, and compile a typology of the main countersurveillance strategies inherent in multimodal posts, such as memes, edited videos, and animations, Photoshop-crafted still images, and (2) explore the contextual traits of the connected dissident culture. We discuss how these multimodal-type posts support connected dissident group formation while maintaining confidentiality while criticizing governmental conduct of economic policy making in Turkey. © The Author(s) 2023."
"Natural language processing holds immense importance across diverse fields, primarily centered around the English language. In contrast, efforts directed at processing Arabic have been comparatively limited. Therefore, our goal is to augment the existing efforts focused on advancing Arabic text processing. Generally speaking, text processing can vary according to specific demands. It encompasses tasks like text recognition, text analysis, or text classification. Among these, text classification has become a key focus in this domain and forms the core subject of this paper. Methods employed span AI to data mining algorithms, selected according to the text and the classification objective. The process consists of four primary stages: dataset selection, preprocessing and representation, text classification, and experimentation/evaluation. The objective of this paper is to compile the latest research that contributes to solving some of the challenges of Arabic text processing in a precise manner and highlight their contributions, findings, methodologies, and advancements in the Arabic Natural Language Processing ANLP field. In addition, we discuss and analyze these studies to find their limitations and make some suggestions.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Algorithmic biases, or algorithmic unfairness, have been a topic of public and scientific scrutiny for the past years, as increasing evidence suggests the pervasive assimilation of human cognitive biases and stereotypes in such systems. This research is specifically concerned with analyzing the presence of discursive biases in the text generated by GPT-3, an NLPM which has been praised in recent years for resembling human language so closely that it is becoming difficult to differentiate between the human and the algorithm. The pertinence of this research object is substantiated by the identification of race, gender and religious biases in the model’s completions in recent research, suggesting that the model is indeed heavily influenced by human cognitive biases. To this end, this research inquires: How does the Natural Language Processing Model GPT-3 replicate existing social biases?. This question is addressed through the scrutiny of GPT-3’s completions using Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), a method which has been deemed as amply valuable for this research as it is aimed at uncovering power asymmetries in language. As such, the analysis is specifically centered around the analysis of gender and race biases in the model’s generated text. Research findings suggest that GPT-3’s language generation model significantly exacerbates existing social biases while replicating dangerous ideologies akin to white supremacy and hegemonic masculinity as factual knowledge. © 2023, The Author(s)."
"This text argues that psychoanalytic philosophy is a valuable tool for the Philosophy of Sport. To situate it within the philosophical tradition, I place Freud’s ideas as an heir to the Philosophy of Impulse of Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. Then, I explain how psychoanalytic philosophy can be understood as a form of hermeneutics, which aligns well with the interests of the field. I also recognise the importance of questioning whether we can consider sports and their events as analysable psychoanalytic facts. To this purpose, I use Paul Ricoeur’s methodological approach, which proposes to analyse collective and common phenomena hermeneutically as psychoanalytic facts. I demonstrate the consistency of this method and adapt it to the Philosophy of Sport. The method involves a triangular operation that analyses psychoanalytic facts by articulating their relationships of meaning (narratives, manifest content, memories and objects), their relationships of force (resistances, neurotic repetitions, symptoms, latent contents and transfers), and psychoanalytic theory. As an example, I apply this method to conduct a micro-psychoanalytic analysis of Brazil’s defeat to Germany in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which the Brazilian coach referred to as a ‘blanked out’ moment. I observe that the destiny of drives, which Freud understood as the tendency of unconscious material to return to consciousness in the form of commitments to objects and symptoms, is prominent in sports reality. This may encourage us to see the potential of promising interpretations grounded in the Psychoanalytic Philosophy of Sport. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"Online second language instruction has boomed in recent years, aided by technological affordances and the forced changes in instructional modality resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This transformation has underscored the critical role of interaction in online pedagogy. Research suggests that increasing opportunities for interaction between students and instructors is essential for fostering second language acquisition (SLA). However, little research exists quantifying the production of diverse types of interaction in online language instruction, particularly among experienced instructors. The present study utilizes an interactionist framework to perform a quantitative analysis of interaction in online Spanish language coursework, categorized according to interaction initiation type: Instructor-Prompted Participation (IPP), Unprompted Oral Participation (UOP), Unprompted Text Participation (UTP), i.e., chat usage, and interaction length (as exhibited by both the number of student turns in an interaction and the average length of those turns). Data includes 18 h of video recordings of synchronous L2 Spanish language instruction across proficiency levels and lesson types at a distance-learning university in the UK. Lesson types included grammar workshops and exam preparation. Results show that the interactional patterns in online language courses are influenced by proficiency level and lesson type. Lower proficiency students engaged in interaction routines more frequently, while the ability to engage in extended discourse was contingent upon the specific activity/lesson type. The study helps address the dearth of research on interaction and language teaching in languages other than English (LOTE). © 2023 The Author(s).

"Background: The digitalization of medicine is becoming a transformative force in modern healthcare systems. This study aims to investigate discussions regarding patient safety, as well as summarize perceived approaches to mitigating risks of adverse events expressed through the #PatientSafety Twitter hashtag during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This research is grounded in the analysis of data extracted from Twitter under the hashtag #PatientSafety between December 1, 2019 and February 1, 2023. Symplur Signals, which represents a tool offering a method to monitor tweets containing hashtags registered with the Symplur Healthcare Hashtag Project, was used for analyzing the tweets shared in the study period. For text analytics of the relevant data, we further used the word cloud generator MonkeyLearn, and VOSviewer. Results: The analysis encompasses 358′809 tweets that were shared by 90′079 Twitter users, generating a total of 1′183’384′757 impressions. Physicians contributed to 18.65% of all tweets, followed by other healthcare professionals (14.31%), and health-focused individuals (10.91%). Geographically, more than a third of tweets (60.90%) were published in the United States. Canada and India followed in second and third positions, respectively. Blocks of trending terms of greater interest to the global Twitter community within the hashtag #PatientSafety were determined to be: “Patient,” “Practical doctors,” and “Health Care Safety Management.” The findings demonstrate the engagement of the Twitter community with COVID-19 and problems related to the training, experience of doctors and patients during a pandemic, communication, the vaccine safety and effectiveness, and potential use of off-label drugs. Noteworthy, in the field of pharmacovigilance, Twitter has the possibility of identifying adverse reactions associated with the use of drugs, including vaccines. The issue of medical errors has been also discussed by Twitter users using the hashtag #PatientSafety. Conclusion: It is clear that various stakeholders, including students, medical practitioners, health organizations, pharmaceutical companies, and regulatory bodies, leverage Twitter to rapidly exchange medical information, data on the disease symptoms, and the drug effects. Consequently, there is a need to further integrate Twitter-derived data into the operational routines of healthcare organizations.

"The use of natural language processing (NLP) methods for assessing employee performance is examined in this research article. The paper suggests a technique for extracting pertinent information on work performance from employee-generated text data, such as emails, chats, and feedback surveys. The suggested approach makes use of NLP methods including topic modelling, sentiment analysis, and text classification to extract characteristics that may be utilized as performance indicators for employees. The study's findings imply that the suggested approach, when compared to more conventional assessment techniques, may provide a more comprehensive perspective of employee performance, and assist managers in reaching more informed conclusions about that performance. © 2023 IEEE."
"BACKGROUND: In Africa, little is known about the role of telephone hotlines in outbreak response. We systematically reviewed the role and effectiveness of hotlines on outbreak response in Africa. METHOD: We used the Cochrane handbook and searched five databases. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42021247141). Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Global Health and Web of Science were searched from 30 June 2020 to August 2020 for studies on the use of telephone hotlines in outbreak response in Africa published between January 1995 and August 2020. The search was also repeated on 16 September 2022. Data on effectiveness (alerts generated, cases confirmed) were extracted from peer-reviewed studies. Meta-analysis of alerts generated, and proportion of cases confirmed was done using the random effects model. The quality of studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) tools. The heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using the Galbraith and funnel plots, respectively. RESULTS: Our search yielded 1251 non-duplicate citations that were assessed. 41 full texts were identified, and 21 studies were included in the narrative synthesis, while 12 were included in the meta-analysis. The hotlines were local (seven studies) or national (three studies). A combination of a local and national hotline was used in one study. The hotlines were set up for unusual respiratory events (one study), polio (one study), Ebola (10 studies), COVID-19 (two studies), malaria (one study), influenza-like illnesses (ILI) (one study) and rift valley fever in livestock (one study). Hotlines were mainly used for outbreak surveillance at the local level. A total of 332,323 alerts were generated, and 67,658 met the case definition, corresponding to an overall pooled proportion of alerts generated(sensitivity) of 38% (95%CI: 24-52%). The sensitivity was 41% (95% CI: 24-59%) for local hotlines and 26%(95%CI:5-47%) for national hotlines. Hotlines were also used for surveillance of rift valley fever in livestock (one study) vaccination promotion (one study), death reporting (five studies), rumour tracking and fighting misinformation (two studies) and community engagement (five studies). The studies were of low to moderate quality with high publication bias and heterogeneity(I2 = 99%). The heterogeneity was not explained by the sample size. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that telephone hotlines can be effective in outbreak disease surveillance in Africa. Further implementation research is needed to scale up telephone hotlines in rural areas. Copyright: © 2023 Fongwen et al.

"This paper takes as its starting point the current debates surrounding new forms of reading and writing on online platforms, particularly those interfaces aimed at adolescent or young adult audiences. The focal point of this analysis is Wattpad, a digital literary production, distribution, and consumption platform that presents reading and writing as a communal, multimedia, and interactive phenomenon. This article outlines some of its key features, along with a brief data analysis aiming to sketch the general functioning of the algorithm that determines the success of texts published on the platform. By creating two databases using web scraping techniques and subsequently processing them using Python in the Jupyter Notebooks environment, this study draws partial conclusions about the potential of the website and some of its potential transformations in young adult reading and writing practices. © 2023 Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata.

"Introduction: The laboratory report is a widely used genre in the academic training process in civil computer engineering. Students produce this genre in the university classroom for diverse academic and professional purposes. Despite its relevance, empirical rhetorical-discursive descriptions of the value of student writing are still scarce in Spanish. Thus, we describe the rhetorical-discursive organization of the laboratory report genre in this subdiscipline. Methods: To fulfil this purpose, we followed a methodological design based on Swalesian Genre Analysis and used a corpus of ninety-eight texts. The sample was collected in a self-compiled form through consultation with teachers and students in the university classroom. The application of this method allowed us to determine the macro-moves, moves, and rhetorical steps of the genre, its communicative functions, and textual features. Results: The resulting rhetorical model consisted of four macro-moves, twelve moves and seventeen steps. This model shows the highly dynamic and mesogeneric nature of this genre, the new functions of multimodal artefacts, and the genre’s presence across the curriculum. To know about the teachers’ and students’ views on the process of training professional writers in engineering, the rhetorical model was complemented with an ethnographic phase (in the terms proposed by Swales: corroboration process with a couple of members of the community) before and after collecting the textual corpus. Discussion: Finally, the implications for genre theory, Spanish language theory and pedagogy of the Spanish language and genre pedagogy are discussed. Copyright © 2023 Sologuren."
"Background: Digital health literacy is considered a health determinant that can influence improved health and well-being, health equity, and the reduction of social health inequalities. Therefore, it serves as an asset for individuals to promote their health. However, low digital health literacy is a major problem among forced migrant populations. They do not always have the capacity and skills to access digital health resources and use them appropriately. To our knowledge, no studies are currently available to examine effective interventions for improving digital health literacy among forced migrant populations. Objective: This paper presents the protocol for a systematic review that aims to assess the effectiveness of digital health literacy interventions among forced migrant populations. With this review, our objectives are as follows: (1) identify interventions designed to improve digital health literacy among forced migrant populations, including interventions aimed at creating enabling conditions or environments that cater to the needs and expectations of forced migrants limited by low levels of digital health literacy, with the goal of facilitating their access to and use of eHealth resources; (2) define the categories and describe the characteristics of these interventions, which are designed to enhance the abilities of forced migrants or adapt digital health services to meet the needs and expectations of forced migrant populations. Methods: A mixed methods systematic review will be conducted according to the PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols) checklist. The research will be conducted in an iterative process among the different authors. With the help of a medical information specialist, a specific search strategy will be formulated for the 6 most relevant databases (ie, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, Academic Search Premier, PsycINFO, and the Google Scholar search engine). A literature search covering studies published between 2000 and 2022 has already been conducted. Two reviewers then proceeded, individually and independently, to conduct a double selection of titles, abstracts, and then full texts. Data extraction will be conducted by a reviewer and validated by a senior researcher. We will use the narrative synthesis method (ie, structured narrative summaries of key themes) to present a comprehensive picture of effective digital health literacy interventions among forced migrant populations and the success factors of these interventions. Results: The search strategy and literature search were completed in December 2022. A total of 1232 articles were identified. The first selection was completed in July 2023. The second selection is still in progress. The publication of the systematic review is scheduled for December 2023. Conclusions: This mixed methods systematic review will provide comprehensive knowledge on effective interventions for digital literacy among forced migrant populations. The evidence generated will further inform stakeholders and aid decision makers in promoting equitable access to and use of digital health resources for forced migrant populations and the general population in host countries. © 2023 The Author(s)."
"Main text The pilot study CCQM-P204 was aimed at evaluating the level of compatibility of laboratories' measurement capabilities to value assign isotope ratios in samples of pure CO2 gas, expressed as isotope delta values relative to the relevant international scale: δ13CVPDB and δ18OVPDB-CO2. Pure CO2 gas samples were prepared by the BIPM in batches of 10 samples of the same gas and circulated to participants for measurement. Each participant received four samples of CO2 with a different nominal δ13CVPDB value: −1 ‰; −9 ‰; −35 ‰; and −42 ‰. The BIPM was also responsible for evaluating the homogeneity and stability of the samples. The co-coordinator IAEA received one sample per batch to confirm the batch-to-batch homogeneity. Within-batch and between-batch inhomogeneity was assessed and found to be negligible in comparison to the spread of results reported by participants. Participants used the analytical technique of their choice to measure the isotope delta values. They were requested to report the measurement results together with detailed information on their traceability, measurement methods and data treatment. Results of the comparison were to be compiled by the BIPM and evaluated jointly by the BIPM and the IAEA. The majority of participants reported results using DI-IRMS, and those that reported results based on laser spectroscopy techniques showed a very similar dispersion of results as for DI-IRMS, although generally with greater uncertainty. A total of nineteen participants reported their measurements, with two of them reporting results with different reference materials to provide more insight into the traceability of the measurements. The results were reported with traceability to three different VPDB scale realizations, notably VPDB, VPDB-LSVEC and VPDB2020, with 8, 7 and 6 results reported respectively for each of these. Participants agreed that results based on VPDB and VPDB2020 scale realizations should, in principle, lead to consistent results, whereas those based on VPDB-LSVEC should show a bias that increased as samples became more depleted in 13C, with the bias approaching 0.2 ‰ for the most depleted sample. This bias was demonstrated by the participant reporting the most precise measurements based on the VPDB-LSVEC realizations, whereas for 2 participants using VPDB-LSVEC scale realizations other issues dominated the consistency of their results. The 3 laboratories using the NIST (8562,8563, 8564) reference materials (reported as on the VPDB-LSVEC scale), were highly consistent with each other, but the reported bias for the VPDB-LSVEC realization was not evident, with the historical method used for value assignment of the NIST RMs, and their relatively large uncertainty, being identified as possible causes for this. In general, for all results the dispersion was greater than expected based on the measurement uncertainties reported by participants. This dispersion increased as the samples became more depleted in 13C, so that results that were traceable to realizations of the VPDB scale that could be considered equivalent (VPDB and VPDB2020) did not lead to ensembles that were fully consistent within their stated uncertainties. Either the reduced chi-squared or Birge Ratio provide easily calculated quantities to characterise lack of consistency in a data set, where consistent data would lead to values of unity for either of these, and discrepant data leading to increased values. This is most readily demonstrated by considering results based on DI-IRMS with traceability to the VPDB scale through either VPDB and VPDB 2020 realizations, where the standard deviation of 16 results was 0.043 ‰ and a Birge Ratio of 2.7 calculated for nominally −1‰ for δ13C, and the standard deviation was 0.12 ‰ and a Birge Ratio of 2.9 calculated at nominally −9 ‰ for δ18O. For the samples where the nominal δ13C value was −42 ‰, the standard deviation of 17 results was 0.085 ‰ and a Birge Ratio of 4.5 calculated for δ13C, and the standard deviation was 0.24 ‰ and a Birge Ratio of 3.4 calculated for δ18O at nominally −36 ‰. The observed magnitude of the standard deviation of results can also be compared to the standard uncertainty of the IAEA-603 materials certified values (0.01 ‰ for δ13C and 0.04 ‰ δ18O) and the smallest standard uncertainties reported by a participant (0.005 ‰ for δ13C, and 0.01 ‰ for δ18O). These results indicate an underestimation of uncertainty for reported results, especially for those with the smallest uncertainties. Components of uncertainty that should be reviewed before future comparisons include: the uncertainty contribution from reference materials; the uncertainty associated with the phosphoric acid reaction with carbonate reference materials; corrections and uncertainties related to cross-contamination effects in the IRMS; appropriate methods for combining uncertainties of multiple reference materials and accounting for their correlations. A retreatment of results, which normalizes results to the −1 ‰ and −42 ‰ δ13C samples, leads to improvement in the consistency of results as demonstrated for measurements on the nominally −35 ‰ δ13C, −30 ‰ δ18O samples for which the standard deviation is reduced to 0.034 ‰ and 0.057 ‰ for δ13C and δ18O respectively (from 0.072 ‰ and 0.198 ‰ without normalization). The results of the comparison indicate that once issues of non-ideal methods and use of LSVEC are removed, discrepancies in results arise from the challenges in accurately transferring delta values from carbonate reference materials to CO2 gaseous samples, and that these issues can be reduced by having appropriate gaseous reference standards for calibration when measuring CO2 gaseous samples. This is consistent with the identical treatment principle that is preferred in the isotope ratio measurement community. An analysis of results is presented in this report, with further consideration of the impact of the measurement method, the scale, and the reference materials. Uncertainties reported by participants are detailed and analysed, highlighting important differences in the uncertainty sources considered. Although CCQM-P204 was a comparison organised within the CCQM/GAWG and IRWG, no reference value was calculated, mainly because not all results appeared to be strictly on the same scale. Instead, a list of recommendations is provided to encourage more harmonised measurement practices and reach better consistency in future comparisons on similar materials.

"The article focuses on voice and speech training in the education process. It identifies the parameters of preparing the foreign texts of vocal repertoire, marks some peculiarities of phrasal stress and means of semantic emphasis in French, that affect its vocalization. It reveals the problem of music and speech syntax combination in vocal phrasing in French. The author addresses the issue of the speech flow division into elements with varying degrees of emphasis and accentuation. The analysis of speech and music structure, the question of synthesis of artistic and technical in singing was described by examples of French vocal pieces. The author concludes that new special voice and speech training is needed to create. The first priority is to build the skill to work with foreign text of vocal repertoire (include French repertoire). © Малашенко Е. П., 2023"
"Background: The current emphasis among addiction treatment providers is to use person-first language, such as “a person with a substance use disorder,” as a way to reduce stigma around addiction and resulting barriers to treatment. This study considers how individuals recovering from substance use feel about the terms “alcoholic” and “addict,” particularly how they self-identify and whether they believe the terms carry stigma. Method: Thirty-five individuals were interviewed, recruited primarily, but not exclusively, from 12-step meetings (Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous), from 3 locations throughout a rural New England state. Interviews were transcribed and coded in Atlas Ti qualitative analysis software, and a content analysis of text coded with “stigma” was conducted. Results: Some comments reflected a belief that the terms “addict” and “alcoholic” carry a stigma. However, more comments rejected the notion of these being stigmatized terms; or acknowledged the stigma but reflected the subject’s lack of internalizing of any stigma. Comments reflected other themes including a sense of pride, identity and ownership when self-identifying as an addict or alcoholic. Several comments suggested that person-first language is part of a larger movement to “soften everything,” without changing the underlying condition (addiction). The findings may reflect the fact that subjects were recruited from 12-step programs, where the convention is to self-identity using the terms “alcoholic” and/or “addict.” Conclusions: Some individuals seeking treatment for addiction may prefer self-identifying using old-school terminology (addict, alcoholic) rather than person-first language, for a variety of reasons (eg, they do not internalize the stigma of such terms). © The Author(s) 2023."
"Objectives: As the initial crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic recedes, healthcare decision makers are likely to want to make rational evidence-guided choices between the many interventions now available. We sought to update a systematic review to provide an up-to-date summary of the cost-effectiveness evidence regarding tests for SARS-CoV-2 and treatments for COVID-19. Methods: Key databases, including MEDLINE, EconLit and Embase, were searched on 3 July 2023, 2 years on from the first iteration of this review in July 2021. We also examined health technology assessment (HTA) reports and the citations of included studies and reviews. Peer-reviewed studies reporting full health economic evaluations of tests or treatments in English were included. Studies were quality assessed using an established checklist, and those with very serious limitations were excluded. Data from included studies were extracted into predefined tables. Results: The database search identified 8,287 unique records, of which 54 full texts were reviewed, 28 proceeded for quality assessment, and 15 were included. Three further studies were included through HTA sources and citation checking. Of the 18 studies ultimately included, 17 evaluated treatments including corticosteroids, antivirals and immunotherapies. In most studies, the comparator was standard care. Two studies in lower-income settings evaluated the cost effectiveness of rapid antigen tests and critical care provision. There were 17 modelling analyses and 1 trial-based evaluation. Conclusion: A large number of economic evaluations of interventions for COVID-19 have been published since July 2021. Their findings can help decision makers to prioritise between competing interventions, such as the repurposed antivirals and immunotherapies now available to treat COVID-19. However, some evidence gaps remain present, including head-to-head analyses, disease-specific utility values, and consideration of different disease variants.

"Background: Cellulitis is defined as an infection of the skin that is usually characterized by localized but poorly demarcated areas of erythema, swelling, and pain. Erysipelas is a subtype of cellulitis that is characterized by a more superficial infection, often involving the face. Because gram-positive bacteria are the most common infective agent, beta-lactam antibiotics such as cephalosporins are commonly used. However, guidelines and physician preference vary widely as different antibiotic options and routes of administration exist, in addition to the fact that most cases are treated empirically without microbiological lab guidance. This lack of standardization in evidence, guidelines, and physician practice prompted this systematic review and meta-analysis of both randomized trial data and cohort studies to aggregate the currently available evidence for the optimal routes of antibiotic administration in cellulitis treatment. Objective: The primary objective of our review is to compare the efficacy of oral versus intravenous antibiotic administration for cellulitis infections, thereby providing clinicians with evidence-based guidelines for treatment. Methods: We will search MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL through Ovid as well as Web of Science and CINAHL for all available literature comparing different routes of antibiotic administration in the treatment of cellulitis and erysipelas. We will perform title and abstract as well as full-text screening in duplicate according to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) guidelines and then extract the relevant data using a prepiloted data sheet. The primary outcome for our review is the duration of infection resolution, and secondary outcomes such as incidence of sepsis, mortality, hospital admission, and Clostridium difficile infection. We will assess the risk of bias in our included studies using the RoB 2.0 (revised tool for Risk of Bias in randomized trials) and ROBINS-I (Risk of bias in non-randomized studies for interventions) tools, with a final quality assessment using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework and a sensitivity analysis to examine heterogeneity. Results: We will publish the final results of our systematic review in a peer-reviewed academic journal. This project received no funding or financial assistance. Data analysis is currently underway, and the results are expected to be submitted for publication in late November 2023. ©Raymond Yin."
"Music is a fundamental element in every culture, serving as a universal means of expressing our emotions, feelings, and beliefs. This work investigates the link between our moral values and musical choices through lyrics and audio analyses. We align the psychometric scores of 1,480 participants to acoustics and lyrics features obtained from the top 5 songs of their preferred music artists from Facebook Page Likes. We employ a variety of lyric text processing techniques, including lexicon-based approaches and BERT-based embeddings, to identify each song's narrative, moral valence, attitude, and emotions. In addition, we extract both low- and high-level audio features to comprehend the encoded information in participants' musical choices and improve the moral inferences. We propose a Machine Learning approach and assess the predictive power of lyrical and acoustic features separately and in a multimodal framework for predicting moral values. Results indicate that lyrics and audio features from the artists people like inform us about their morality. Though the most predictive features vary per moral value, the models that utilised a combination of lyrics and audio characteristics were the most successful in predicting moral values, outperforming the models that only used basic features such as user demographics, the popularity of the artists, and the number of likes per user. Audio features boosted the accuracy in the prediction of empathy and equality compared to textual features, while the opposite happened for hierarchy and tradition, where higher prediction scores were driven by lyrical features. This demonstrates the importance of both lyrics and audio features in capturing moral values. The insights gained from our study have a broad range of potential uses, including customising the music experience to meet individual needs, music rehabilitation, or even effective communication campaign crafting.

"This study examines patterns of disaster commemoration in Texas as witnessed in 1,590 markers erected by the state between 1936 and 2019. In the first half of the analysis, we highlight spatiotemporal trends of commemoration, which focus on a few well-known historic disasters that occurred between 1875 and 1916. From a spatial perspective, markers concentrate in the coastal cities of Galveston, Houston, and Corpus Christi, but no discernible temporal patterns emerge concerning the timing of commemoration—that is, when a marker is erected. After looking at the when and where of commemoration, in the second part of the analysis we look at how each disaster term is described in the text of the markers. Here, the narrative is one of initial destruction quickly followed by recovery and the reestablishment of communities. We also note how the selective nature of commemoration extends to disaster. © Copyright © 2023 by the American Geographical Society of New York."
"Introduction: Since the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), public safety measures, including social distancing and school closures, have been implemented, precipitating psychological difficulties and heightened online activities for adolescents. However, studies examining the impact of the pandemic on adolescent mental health and their coping strategies in Asian countries are limited. Further, most studies have used survey measures to capture mental health challenges so far. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the psychological challenges South Korean adolescents experienced and their coping strategies during the pandemic using the Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Text mining (TM) technique on adolescents’ social media texts/posts. Methods: The data were gathered from social media texts/posts such as online communities, Twitter, and personal blogs from January 1, 2019, to October 31, 2021. The 12,520,250 texts containing keywords related to adolescents’ common psychological difficulties reported during the pandemic, including self-harm, Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders (ADHD), and insomnia, were analyzed by TM, NLP using information extraction, co-occurrence and sentiment analysis. The monthly frequency of the keywords and their associated words was also analyzed to understand the time trend. Results: Adolescents used the word “self-harm” in their social media texts more frequently during the second wave of COVID-19 (August to September 2020). “Friends” was the most associated word with “self-harm.” While the frequency of texts with “Insomnia” stayed constant throughout the pandemic, the word “ADHD” was increasingly mentioned in social media. ADHD and insomnia were most frequently associated with ADHD medications and sleeping pills, respectively. Friends were generally associated with positive words, while parents were associated with negative words. Conclusion: During COVID-19, Korean adolescents often expressed their psychological challenges on social media platforms. However, their coping strategies seemed less efficient to help with their difficulties, warranting strategies to support them in the prolonged pandemic era. For example, Korean adolescents shared psychological challenges such as self-harm with friends rather than their parents. They considered using medicine (e.g., sleeping pills and ADHD medication) as coping strategies for sleep and attention problems. Copyright © 2023 Do, Kim, Lim, Kim, Kwon, Kim, Lee and Kim."
"This article briefly reconstructs the profile of Alberto Asor Rosa as a scholar, political ideologue, cultural organizer and writer. The evolution of this author proceeded from his search for revolutionary political solutions to a pessimistic vision of contemporary society, which appeared to him as confused and disorderly. Furthermore, among the thousands of pages written by him, we have chosen some original examples of discussions of literary texts which go beyond an ideological analysis. Copyright © FrancoAngeli."
"Given the widespread incorporation of social media into everyday existence, platforms such as Twitter have become crucial arenas for individuals to articulate their thoughts, emotions, and viewpoints. The ability to identify emotions in these facial expressions has a wide range of practical uses, including tailored marketing strategies and research on human behaviour. Nevertheless, the language used on these platforms is frequently filled with colloquialisms and vagueness, rendering the process of detecting emotions a challenging endeavour even for individuals. The difficulties in analysing emotions on Twitter are particularly noticeable because current natural language processing (NLP) techniques have limited ability to handle slang language, and earlier classifiers that rely on slang have produced unsatisfactory results. This paper presents a new model for categorising emotions in tweets that contain slang. The model combines multiple approaches and utilises the WordNET dataset. The WordNET library is used in the proposed model to create synonymous phrases for the sentences in the text. The text data is divided into segments, reduced to their root forms, then filtered to remove often used words using natural language processing (NLP) approaches. The textual properties are described by utilising Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and n-gram based similarity approaches. Emotions are classified by the utilisation of a convolutional neural network (CNN). An analysis was conducted on the performance of this model based on the metrics of classification accuracy and processing speed. The findings revealed a remarkable level of accuracy in classifying emotions in slang language using the suggested model, achieving a precise categorization rate of 89.3%. This study represents a notable advancement in the field of emotion classification in social media writing that contains slang language. © 2023 Lavoisier. All rights reserved."
"This essay was born out of two astonishments: an admiration and a perplexity. On the one hand, this essay was born out of our admiration for the text of the question De aeternitate mundi, written by St. Thomas Aquinas in the full maturity of his thought (1271). It is a philosophically exemplary text, in terms of construction and discernment, in which the author argues that there is no contradiction between the theology of creation and the possibility of an eternal world, in accordance with Aristotelian physics. On the other hand, we were also motivated by our perplexity with the difficulty that even today the Christian faith in creation experiences in dealing with the Darwinian theory of evolution. It occurred to us, then, to elaborate a question of evolution, entirely analogous, in construction and in discernment, to the question of the eternity of the world, as it had been thought of by St. Thomas Aquinas. Thus, we also argue here that there is no contradiction between the theology of creation and the possibility of a world in evolution, according to Darwin’s biological theory. And we do this by following the structure of the Thomasian question step by step. © 2023 Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia. All Rights Reserved."
"Background: Osteoporosis or cardiovascular disease prevalence increase with age. Osteoporosis medicine’s cardiovascular safety should be monitored. We evaluate the cardiovascular effects of anti-osteoporosis medications, namely hormone therapies, bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone analogs, anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, and romosozumab. Method: We performed a standard, random-effect, pairwise meta-analysis for cardiovascular disease risk to estimate the available direct evidence of each drug class. The literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov on December 31, 2021. Parallel group randomized and controlled trials were eligible if they compared one kind of anti-osteoporosis agents. For every possible pairwise comparison, the association between treatment and outcomes was obtained using odds. Results: The search yielded 10,162 records. Screening and full-text article analysis identified 77 trials, including 106,982 patients, comparing five classes of anti-osteoporosis drugs and a placebo. Anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand, revealed a significantly higher risk of cardiovascular disease than placebo (risk ratio 1.25 [95% confidence interval 1.07% to 1.45%]). The Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking confirmed that anti-receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand use was most likely to result in cardiovascular disease in patients with osteoporosis; it had a significantly higher risk of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, angina, and transient ischemic accident (risk ratio 1.26 [95% confidence interval 1.01% to 1.58%]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this network meta-analysis of clinical trials of patients with osteoporosis, different classes of anti-osteoporosis medications were associated with different effects on cardiovascular events.

"This article offers an overview of Argentina’s recent political history, focusing on the role played by the Catholic Church, especially its hierarchy. The period under consideration runs from the military Coup d’état of March 1976 to the political and social crisis that led to the outbreak of December 2001. The text begins by considering that the Church occupied a central place in the political life of Argentina throughout the twentieth century and analyses how its prominence changed in a period marked by tensions and disputes. The main argument is that the dynamics of relations between society, politics and the Church in recent decades show a complex panorama, where significant changes coexist, but also continuities that are no less important. In this sense, although it has been suggested that the return of democracy in 1983 should be seen as the beginning of a new stage, it is not defined as a linear or cumulative path leading to a horizon of absolute ruptures with the historically sedimented forms of intervention of the Catholic Church in the political sphere. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG."
"Single occupancy vehicle travel imposes many environmental and economic costs on society, and planners have acknowledged the accessibility benefits that shared mobility offers. Yet few researchers have examined automobile sharing in its most informal forms, including when people coordinate long-distance rides with strangers. To address this gap in the literature, I analyze data from posts from an online rideshare board. I focus on how the informal nature of Craigslist—a website on which people semi-anonymously post requests and offers for shared trips—presents challenges and opportunities for meeting traveler needs. After assembling data via web scraping from the Craigslist rideshare board, I examine posts using text mining and directed content analysis. Among other factors, I emphasize differences by California region, between people who offer and request rides, and between people who engage in primarily commercial versus noncommercial transactions. I find that while rideshare posters primarily listed intercity trips, regional patterns varied, and many income-seeking posters offered services within cities. While some posters mentioned social factors driving them to rideshare, economic considerations strongly motivated most posters. Finally, some posters anticipated negative aspects of informal sharing with strangers, particularly in crossing interpersonal boundaries. Together, these findings suggest gaps in the formal shared transportation system for intercity travel. To address trust and safety concerns, public ridesharing efforts should consider facilitating the exchange of personal demographic information between travelers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"Purpose: The prevalence of osteoporosis increases as the population ages. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of osteoporosis among the general population ≥ 50 years old in Iran. Methods: Multiple databases including Scopus, WOS, Medline, Embase, and Persian databases (SID and Magiran) were systematically searched to identify relevant research papers. All population-based studies estimating the prevalence of osteoporosis in the Iranian population were included and imported into Endnote software. Two authors independently reviewed the articles. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess the risk of bias. Statistical analysis was performed using Stata software, and a significance level of 0.05 was applied to the analyses. Results: Totally 2117 documents were retrieved from the databases up until October 11, 2022. After reading the full texts, 10 documents were included in the study. Our results indicated that the pooled prevalence of osteoporosis in the femoral neck region was 0.19 (95%CI: 0.12–0.26) and 0.19 (95%CI: 0.13–0.25) for women and men, respectively. Pooled prevalence of spinal osteoporosis was 0.29 (95%CI: 0.21–0.38) among women and 0.16 (95%CI: 0.12–0.19) among men. The total pooled prevalence of osteoporosis was 0.38 (95%CI: 0.29–0.48) for women and 0.25 (95%CI: 0.22–0.29) for men. Conclusion: Our study highlights the elevated prevalence of osteoporosis among individuals aged 50 years and older, with females exhibiting higher rates. Notably, osteoporosis in the femoral neck region demonstrated the lowest prevalence in both sexes. The implementation of comprehensive strategies is imperative to address osteoporosis problems effectively. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Tehran University of Medical Sciences."
"To improve the accuracy of the measurement results of traditional sensors and save additional calibration costs, this paper reports the design and calibration of a MEMS 3-axis force sensor with a piezoelectric drive to generate the force signal source. The finite element simulation verifies the working principle and calibration function of the sensor which has a linear range of > 2mathrm{N} in the 3-axis, as well as the detection sensitivity of the sensor is 477.74 text{fF}/mathrm{N} in the normal(z) direction and 723.66 text{fF}/mathrm{N} in the tangential(x/y) direction. Under 10V voltage driving, the normal and tangential calibration ranges reach 174 text{mN} and 355 text{mN} respectively. The sensor designed in this paper can be used as an essential medium for intelligent robots to sense human life and has good potential for applications in medical care, the robotics industry, and wearable devices.  © 2023 IEEE."
"In response to the rapid growth in the popularity of virtual humans, this study investigates the attitudes and perceptions of young viewers, from Generation Z in particular, toward virtual uploaders (VTubers). We qualitatively and quantitatively compared the online mourning directed at the “demised” virtual uploaders and deceased human uploaders, and human celebrities through a data-mining approach. Two salient patterns emerge. The mourning remarks for virtual uploaders are considerably different from those concerning human celebrities. And the mourning remarks for the disembodied human uploaders are more consistent with those for virtual uploaders, but the remarks for embodied human uploaders are more in line with those for offline celebrities. Our findings suggest that young viewers are becoming accustomed to virtual beings in online environments and are beginning to treat humans like machines based on their similarities (the degree of embodiment in this case). Young generations immersed in virtual spaces may develop different concepts of life, demise, and even humanity. © The Author(s) 2023."
"This paper focuses on the extreme hardship suffered by migrants crossing through Libya to reach Italy and Europe. The paper documents and defines the notion of extreme hardship and argues in favour of an ethics of care that provides for protection for those migrants who may not be asylum seekers for what concerns their initial motivation for migrating but who need humanitarian protection because of the harm suffered while en route. Starting with a normative exploration of how an ethics of care can and should inform the policy of countries of arrival, this paper analyses the specific case of Italy and the emerging case law and legal practice in relation to the humanitarian stay permits. Based on the analysis of relevant scholarly literature, policy and legal texts and interviews with expert informants (lawyers and judges) and taking stock of an innovative practice that emerged in Italy in the period 2015–2020, the paper also discusses similar provisions in other European countries and argues for the possibility to develop and codify a humanitarian permit, at national or also European level. © 2023 The Author(s).

"A social scientific approach to the Hebrew Bible allows us to ask questions that were not central to writers of the biblical narrative. Thus, the article uses concepts from group processes in social psychology to analyse the group identity of Moses’ father-in-law as he is portrayed in the Bible and early Jewish and Christian interpretations. Jethro is a particularly interesting figure as he displays characteristics of both an ingroup and an outgroup member. This analysis illustrates how tools from social sciences can contribute not only to a better understanding of group relations in the narrative of the Hebrew Bible but also in the communities of early Jewish and Christian interpreters of these texts.1 © (2023), (Old Testament Society of South Africa).

"The article explores cross-modal iconic relations in nine diverse Western-music songs ranging from 1600 to 2015, all of them thematizing dysphoric weeping. Initial input comes from five recurrent features observed in ancient Greek texts associated with performative events, including the prominence of sound, interjections and strong self-referentiality, repetitions and refrains, the motif of endlessness, and tears associated with streams of water, dew, and libation liquids. The analysis adopts Peirce's conceptual distinction between image, diagram, and metaphor iconicity, although the continuum reading proposed by several scholars is ultimately favored. The sample turns out to offer plenty of evidence of iconic relations. Interjections, falsetto, verbal repetitions, musical repetitions, musical rendering of sighs and endlessness, ostinato patterns, downward notes, and water images (rain and rivers), all of this is shown to substantiate cross-modal iconicity encompassing weeping, lyrics, music (including musical notation), and images, in different combinations. Quantitative investigations confirming/disconfirming and adding iconicity patterns, and comparative analyses linking Western and non-Western lament traditions constitute desiderata for future work. © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."
"This study aims to explore previously uncharted translational areas of Turkish Islamism between 1960 and 1980, a period of deep-rooted ideological tensions in social, political, and ideological spheres of life in Turkey. The analysis starts by providing a theoretical framework that formulates Islamist translational activities as a particular form of culture planning. It primarily focuses on the translation-oriented domestic repertoire construction, which experiences minimal cultural filter, censorship, and interruption despite its heavy dependence on varying sources worldwide. The investigation continues by providing initial premises that shed light on why Islamism resorted to translation to create an Islamic (intellectual) repertoire in Turkish. It is followed by a discursive analysis that demonstrates the functioning of translation in the context of Turkish Islamism. To this end, a case study on the representative Islamist journal Hilal (1958–1993) is conducted to provide concrete insights. Finally, the study introduces a novel perspective, the ‘intra-ummah translation paradigm’, to offer a deeper understanding of the translational resurgence of Islamism in particular and the translation tradition that governs East-oriented text productions in Turkey. © 2023 The Author(s).

"Sign language is an optical language where the formation of signs are done using hands or body gestures. Although, communication using signs are quite understandable among hearing-impaired persons, yet the translation for generic use by other persons remains to be a major challenge. Various techniques are available to convert Sign Languages to Readable text. This paper analyses specifically vision-based techniques for Indian Sign Language Recognition (ISLR). Machine Learning and Deep Learning based techniques for ISLR have been presented here to achieve better accuracy. An experimental setup has been created to analyze the performance of various ML and DL techniques on three different static ISL datasets: First, One-handed with uniform background, second, two-handed with complex background and third one is a mixture of one-handed and two-handed datasets with uniform background. These three datasets have been used to compare the accuracy. The highest accuracy achieved among ML techniques is with the SVM classifier i.e. 99.17%, 81.41% and 99.96% respectively on the three datasets. It is further suggested that by creating Ensemble ML Classifiers or vision based transformers accuracy can be further enhanced. Using DL techniques, highest accuracy achieved on Dataset-I is with ResNet50 model is 100%, on Dataset-II is with MobileNetV2 is 99.96% and on Dataset-III 100% accuracy is achieved by using ResNet50, MobileNetV2 and InceptionResNetV2. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."
"In new generation of Internet applications such as smart healthcare and digital finance, sharing data to gain its value has become popular. However, some data contains personal privacy, and resource-limited devices generally delegate data to a Cloud Service Provider (CSP). CSP may not only be curious, but also selfish to save computation or download bandwidth. Therefore, the verifiable searchable encryption (VSE) scheme is applied to let CSP queries on encrypted data and ensure the integrity of results. Unfortunately, most existing VSE schemes require a trusted third party, which makes it difficult to provide reliable proof or make fair judgments when there occur disputes. With the assistance of blockchain technology, our proposed scheme blockchain-based verifiable searchable encryption (BCVSE) scheme has the following benefits: (1) Trusted proof: The traceability nature of blockchain can provide reliable transaction proof to help resolve disputes. (2) Fair judgment: Smart contracts that are natively supported by blockchain can publicly, transparently, and fairly conduct dispute adjudication and verify the integrity of results without trusted third parties. Furthermore, existing schemes generally make fuzzy queries by extracting data features first and then using similarity-matching algorithms. This leads to an increase in more false positives and a massive result set, making them more suitable for image data rather than text data which have more accurate query conditions. Therefore, we build the Verifiable Accumulator Trie (VAT), which is the core authenticated data structure for both verifiability and fuzzy query on text data. Formal security analysis and performance simulation demonstrate that BCVSE is secure and suitable for various blockchains. © 2023, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals."
"Purpose: Following the trend in the world over and on the African continent, the Parliament of Ghana passed a new law in 2020, the Narcotics Control Commission Act (Act 1019) that eased the legal restrictions on cannabis cultivation and use, subject to obtaining license from the relevant authority/authorities. This paper aims to examine the implications of Ghana’s decision to legalise the cultivation of cannabis for industrial purposes for the production of fibre and for medicinal purposes. Design/methodology/approach: The author adopted the qualitative analysis critical review methodology in sourcing information from peer-reviewed articles, coupled with the author’s own professional knowledge, background and training, to critically analyse and review the reasons behind Ghana’s decision to legalise cannabis cultivation and the implications such a major policy change/shift. Findings: It was found that, while the law mentions industrial and medicinal purposes for the legalisation of cannabis, the real reason, at least in the immediate term, is mainly economic. This agrees with those of other African countries that have legalised cannabis cultivation but appears to contrast with those of Europe and America. Research limitations/implications: This research is limited to Ghana and the few African countries that have legalised cannabis cultivation so far. The main reason for the legalisation (economic benefits) may also change in the future when the economics of scale turn in the favour of the country. Therefore, Ghana’s case may not represent the case of all countries legalising cannabis cultivation. Practical implications: The research implication of this paper is that it brings to the world the law on cannabis cultivation in Ghana. It provides a professional and scientific position paper on Ghana’s drug law regime regarding cannabis, thus, serving as a useful reference literature to the academic and research community on the topic. More importantly, it discusses the implications of such major policy change from an objective perspective, unravelling the real reason behind the State’s decision to legalise the cultivation of cannabis in Ghana. Social implications: This paper will bring to the fore the other consequences of Ghana’s cannabis cultivation legalisation policy change, which little attention has been devoted to so far. Originality/value: This paper, apart from reference to other published texts on the topic, which have been duly acknowledged, represents the sole work of the author. It has not been produced anywhere or by anyone else either in Ghana or elsewhere. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited."
"In order to accelerate the construction of green transportation, reduce the carbon emission in the construction of steel truss structure bridge, and implement the rapid, economical and reasonable design of steel truss-concrete composite beam structure, a multi-objective optimization design method for the whole structure was proposed which considers structural displacement, component stress and building material consumption. With economic benefits and overall structural performance improvement as objective functions, design parameters of each component in steel truss-concrete composite beams as design variables, combined with constraints such as deflection of steel truss-concrete composite beams and material strength, a multi-objective optimal design mathematical model of steel truss-concrete composite beams was established. The key design parameters, such as the vertical height of steel truss, the longitudinal panel length of steel truss, the width of chord section, the height of chord section, the width of diagonal section, the height of diagonal section and the thickness of bridge deck, were selected to analyze the sensitivity of the main section deflection of the whole structure and the maximum stress of key components to the change of key design parameters. Based on the results of sensitivity analysis, 32 groups of orthogonal experiments were designed by selecting key design parameters as orthogonal experimental factors. The calculation method of the optimization and evaluation coefficient of steel truss-concrete composite beam was put forward, and 32 groups of orthogonal test results were evaluated, the main and secondary order of the influence of design parameters on the optimization and evaluation coefficient was determined, the correlation law between structural performance and economic benefit in the design of steel truss-concrete composite beam was clarified, and the optimal design parameter combination of steel truss-concrete composite beam was obtained. The results show that the optimized structural steel dosage is 976. 03 t, which saves about 5. 1% compared with that before optimization, the vertical deflection of the structure decreases about 11. 38%, and the maximum stress reduction of the member is 14.09%. The structural optimization design method based on orthogonal test is suitable for the multi-objective optimization design of steel truss-concrete composite beam structure, and can help realize the national 'double carbon' strategic goal. 7 tabs, 9 figs, 28 refs. © 2023 Editorial Department of Journal of Chang'an University (Natural Science Edition).

Objective The incidence of spine diseases has increased in the contemporary era and is increasingly affecting younger individuals. Therefore，the diagnosis and treatment of such diseases are particularly critical. Using 3D reconstruc⁃ tion technology，computer-aided diagnosis，and segmentation of the spine area and the background area of the spine com⁃ puted tomography（CT）image can assist physicians in clearly observing the spine lesion area and provide theoretical sup⁃ port for surgical path simulation and surgical planning. The accuracy of spine CT image segmentation is critical in restoring the actual position and physiological shape of the patients’vertebrae to the greatest extent possible，thus allowing physi⁃ cians to understand the distribution of lesions. However，the difficulty of spine segmentation is exacerbated by the complex structure of the spine，poor display of tissue structure，poor contrast，and noise interference in spine CT images. The seg⁃ mentation of spine images via manual annotation relies on the physicians’a priori knowledge and clinical experience，and the segmentation results are highly subjective and time consuming. Long working hours may also lead to deviations that affect the patients’diagnosis. With the help of computer technology，the traditional segmentation method mainly uses low-latitude features，such as texture，shape，and color of the image，for segmentation and often can only achieve semiautomatic segmentation. Moreover，this method does not fully utilize the image information and has low segmentation accu⁃ racy that fails to meet the demand of real-time segmentation. The segmentation method based on deep learning can realize automatic segmentation，effectively extract image features，and improve segmentation accuracy. In the branch of computer vision（CV），medical image segmentation algorithms based on convolutional neural network（CNN）have been proposed one after another and have become the mainstream research direction in medical image analysis. Among these algorithms，the characteristics of the U-Net structure itself and the fixed structure of medical images with multi-modality enhance the performance of U-Net in medical image segmentation and provide a benchmark for medical image segmentation. However，the inherent limitations of the convolutional structure can lead to problems，such as limited long-distance interaction. By contrast，Transformer，a non-CNN architecture，integrates a global self-attentive mechanism to capture long-range feature dependencies and is widely used in natural language processing，such as machine translation and text classification. In recent years，researchers have introduced Transformer into the field of computer vision and achieved advanced results in certain tasks，such as image classification and image segmentation. This paper then combines the advantages of the CNN architecture and Transformer to propose a CNN and Transformer hybrid segmentation model called Transformer attention gate U-Net（TransAGUNet）that realizes an efficient and automated segmentation of spine CT images. Method The pro⁃ posed model combines Transformer，U-Net，and the attention gate（AG）mechanism to form an encoding–decoding struc⁃ ture. The encoder uses a hybrid Transformer and CNN architecture，which consists of a combination of ResNet50 and ViT models. For the sliced spine CT images，the low-level features are initially extracted by ResNet50，the feature maps corre⁃ sponding to three downsampled features are retained，and then patch embedding and position embedding are performed. The obtained patches are then inputted to the Transformer encoder to learn long-term contextual dependencies and extract global features. The decoder adopts a CNN architecture that applies 2D bilinear upsampling at 2× rate to recover the image size layer by layer. The AG structure is incorporated into a jump-connected bottom-up triple layer to fuse shallow features with higher-level features for fine segmentation. The decoder uses a CNN structure to recover the image size layer by layer by performing 2D bilinear upsampling at a 2-fold rate. The AG structure is incorporated into the bottom-up three layers of the jump connection to obtain the attention map corresponding to the downsampled features，stitched with the upsampled features in the next layer，and then decoded by two ordinary convolutions and one 1 × 1 convolution. The AG structure then enters the binary classifier and distinguishes the foreground and background pixel by pixel to obtain the spine segmentation prediction map. The AG parameters are computationally small，easily integrated into CNN models，and can automatically learn the shape and size of the target to highlight salient features and suppress feature responses in irrelevant regions. These parameters replace the localization module via probability-based soft attention，thus eliminating the need to divide the ROI，and improve the sensitivity and accuracy of the model by a small amount of computation. The experiments use Dice Loss summed with weighted cross entropy loss as the loss function to solve the uneven distribution of positive and nega⁃ tive samples. Result The proposed algorithm is tested on the VerSe2020 dataset，and the Dice coefficients improve by 4. 47%，2. 09%，2. 44%，and 2. 23% over the mainstream CNN architectures of segmentation networks U-Net，Attention U-Net，U-Net++，and U-Net3+，respectively. Meanwhile，the Dice coefficients over the excellent Transformer and CNN hybrid segmentations TransUNet and TransNorm improve by 2. 25% and 1. 08%，respectively. To verify the validity of the proposed model，several ablation experiments are performed，and results show that compared with TransUNet，the Dice coefficient of the designed decoding structure improves by 0. 75% and by 1. 5% after adding AG. To explore the effect of the number of AG connections on the model performance，experiments are conducted using AG with different numbers of connections，and results show that the Dice coefficient obtained without adding AG is the smallest and that the optimal model performance is achieved by adding AG in three jump connections on the resolution scales of 1/2，1/4，and 1/8. Con⁃ clusion Compared with the above six CNN segmentation models and the Transformer and CNN hybrid segmentation mod⁃ els，the proposed algorithm achieves the best segmentation results on spine CT images，thus effectively improving the seg⁃ mentation accuracy of spine CT images with better segmentation real-time performance. © 2023 Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG.

"Background: Many researchers accept that the Gospel of Mark is apocalyptic, which necessitates the need to determine whether Mark 13’s eschatological discourse represents an apocalypse. Setting: The question of whether the early church utilised an apocalyptic worldview is widely discussed in scholarly circles. Methods: The article utilises a form-critical and syntactical analysis of the text of Mark 13. Results: Mark 13 is deliberately written in a mode displaying several apocalyptic features. The text engages the present crisis situation when Roman authorities quelled Roman resistance by destroying parts of Jerusalem, including the Temple, in response to the question of whether the present crisis indicates the end of the present aeon and the introduction of a new world. Conclusion: The Markan Jesus emphasises that the current situation introduces further suffering and persecution for believers but that does not indicate the end in itself. The time of the end is unknown, even to him. The discourse hence serves anti-apocalypse to discourage believers from overheated end-time expectations of an imminent end. Christians do not know when the end is coming, but they know who they expect to return. Intradisciplinary and/or interdisciplinary implications: The research findings contribute to Old and New Testament studies into apocalypticism. © 2023. The Authors."
"BACKGROUND: Almost at the end of 2022, the world is experiencing a relative calm after the rigors imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowing the ideas, feelings and procedures used by people in this type of unexpected events, which exceeded all established standards of educational and health actions, can help us be prepared for the possible occurrence of similar events. This study aims to determine the main alternative conceptions that pre-service teachers hold about the pandemic and the post-pandemic within the framework of the four basic pillars of Education. METHODS: A case study was conducted using an ethnographic approach. The unit of analysis was made up of 227 students from the major of Primary Education at Universidad Técnica del Norte. Two research instruments were used to collect the data: a test for verbal associations where participants can express themselves freely with hierarchical, substitution and connotative evocations; and Specialized Analytical Summary sheets to revise and organize specialized scientific texts. The data was analyzed using the IRaMuTeQ software. RESULTS: At first glance, what was expressed in the two contexts, both in the pandemic and in the post-pandemic, show a similar structure; however, a deeper analysis reveals different perspectives. CONCLUSIONS: In the end, the alternative conceptions moved from expressing fear to tranquility. Copyright: © 2023 Guerra-Reyes F et al."
"This article synthesizes a set of ideal perspectives on the reading practices dramatized in a selected corpus of child-oriented magazines published between 1921 and 1938 in Santiago, Chile, and Bogotá, Colombia. The analysis is structured around the following research questions: Who are the actual readers of child-oriented magazines during the aforementioned timespan? What do they read for? What reading practices are the most persistent in the texts selected for this paper? Answers were systematized by means of the construction of a typology as an analytic hypothesis on the representation of reading childhoods in this type of publications. The main conclusions of the study allow the creation of useful categories to address the analysis of the practices and reading programs along the history of reading aimed at children during the 20th century as a way of defi ning ideal conceptions of reading and readers. Th is allows identifying similarities between a) the eff ects of reading on the readers, b) the aff ective relations between readers, texts, text-mediators and, c) the functions of reading and printed publications aimed at children. © (2023), (Universidad de Concepcion).

"Keeping in mind the recent COVID-19 pandemic, this paper builds on a study that examined how a major twentieth century South African newspaper utilised outbreaks of bubonic plague to propagate racial stereotypes in Johannesburg. The data were gathered from the Rand Daily Mail archive database and analysed thematically. Recent years have seen the emergence of new disciplines, such as historical pragmatics, along with calls for historians to move beyond collecting documentation into textual analysis. Thus, the researchers reanalysed selected data using systemic functional grammar to discover how the communicative intention was achieved. The research follows a descriptive qualitative method. It was found that the newspaper played a major role in the promotion of racial segregation. However, at times its reporting was nuanced. Understanding how past media made use of events and discourses to influence the public and achieve political goals can serve to inform the present and illuminate the future. © 2023 Unisa Press."

"The impact of OpenAI’s ChatGPT on education has led to a reexamination of traditional pedagogical methods and assessments. However, ChatGPT’s performance capabilities on a wide range of assessments remain to be determined. This study aims to classify ChatGPT-generated and student constructed responses to a college-level environmental science question and explore the linguistic- and content-level features that can be used to address the differential use of language. Coh-Metrix textual analytic tool was implemented to identify and extract linguistic and textual feature. Then we employed random forest feature selection method to determine the best representative and nonredundant text-based features. We also employed TF-IDF metrics to represent the content of written responses. The true performance of classification models for the responses was evaluated and compared in three scenarios: (a) using content-level features alone, (b) using linguistic-level features alone, (c) using the combination of two. The results demonstrated that the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-score all increased when we used the combination of two-level features. The results of this study hold promise to provide valuable insights for instructors to detect student responses and integrate ChatGPT into their course development. This study also highlights the significance of linguistic- and content-level features in AI education research. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023."
"This study aims to analyse the strategies supporting the German Government's biopolitical health and life protection practices and how they were promoted in the discourse of non-state media outlets during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is assumed that non-state media used various pandemic communication strategies to achieve common biopolitical goals, striking a balance between propaganda and outreach. A comparative analysis was conducted of German publications that focused on the pandemic and appeared during the four waves (January 2020 —March 2022). A total of 54,515 texts from the German media (Süddeutsche Zeitung, Die Zeit, Die Tageszeitung) were examined. Methodologically, the study draws on the Herman-Chomsky propaganda model and Jacques Ellul's concept. The results show that non-state media employ different communication strategies in line with the filters of the Herman-Chomsky model. All the media outlets maintained a balance between propaganda and public outreach, supporting the Government's biopolitical programme whilst prioritising their own interests. It can be concluded that the strategies chosen by the non-state media outlets instilled a sense of confidence, prompting the public to comply with the restrictions and measures consistent with the biopolitical agenda of the state. © (2023) Balakina, J.

"Objective This study aims to investigate the measurement of posterior tibial slope (PTS) and its research progress on anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury and reconstruction Methods Recent literature related to PTS in ACL injury published from January 2000 to December 2022 were searched in the database of CNKI, Wanfang data, and PubMed. The following keywords were used: ""胫骨平台后倾角,""""测量,""""前交叉韧带,""""损伤,"" and ""重建""as well as ""posterior tibial slope, """"measure,""""anterior cruciate ligament,""""injure,""and ""reconstruction"". A total of 574 were obtained, and 47 were finally included in the analysis after excluding those that were inconsistent to the subject, had incomplete text and low quality and level of evidence, and were replicates. The measurement methods of PTS were summarized, and the effect and mechanism of PTS in ACL injury and reconstruction were explored. Results PTS was measured by X-ray, CT, and MRI. X-ray measurement is the simplest and most widely used method, but its measured value is affected by the reference mark and the length of the selected tibial axis. CT and MRI measurements can effectively eliminate the influence of tibial rotation, and the measured value is more accurate; however, their technical difficulty and costs are high. PTS is an anatomic factor in ACL injury. Excessive levels of PTS will cause excessive internal rotation of the knee during movement, thereby accelerating the occurrence of ACL strain and leading to ACL injury. In ACL reconstruction, excessive PTS will affect the surgical effect by inducing the anterior tibial subluxation of the knee joint after reconstruction and influencing graft roof impingement. Conclusion At present, the measurement method of PTS and its standard value have not been standardized. Excessive PTS will lead to the injury of ACL and affect the clinical outcomes of ACL reconstruction. For patients with ACL injury, a suitable method should be selected to measure PTS before conducting appropriate surgery. © 2023 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd"
"This study examines the writing of adolescent Pacific Islander girls who, during a community-based workshop, drafted statements of purpose (SOP) for scholarship applications. Pacific Islander migrants are among the most marginalized residents in Hawai‘i. Our project engaged the girls in telling their own stories through writing. Following New Literacies Studies approaches, we designed a multi-week workshop where the girls reflected on their stories and drafted SOPs. We collected the texts and used qualitative content analysis to investigate how the girls presented their stories. Analyses reveal that the girls authored stories from their own lives, relating their migrations across cultural and geographic borders, accomplishments and challenges, and aspirations for the future. The younger girls represented themselves differently from the older girls. For this group of multilingual adolescent girls, writing their SOP in a familiar out-of-school setting allowed them to express their identities as transnational youth with both traditional and modern sensibilities. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"Recent advances in Big Data Analytics are primarily driven by innovations in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Methods. Due to the richness of data sources at the edge and with the increasing privacy concerns, Distributed privacy-preserving machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly becoming the norm for training ML models on federated big data. In a popular approach known as Federated learning (FL), service providers leverage end-user data to train ML models to improve services such as text auto-completion, virtual keyboards, and item recommendations. FL is expected to grow in importance with the increasing focus on big data, privacy and 5G/6G technologies. However, FL faces significant challenges such as heterogeneity, communication overheads, and privacy preservation. In practice, training models via FL is time-intensive and worse its dependent on client participation who may not always be available to join the training. Our empirical analysis shows that client availability can significantly impact the model quality which motivates the design of an availability-aware selection scheme. We propose A2FL to mitigate the quality degradation caused by the under-representation of the global client population by prioritizing the least available clients. Our results show that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, A2FL can improve the client diversity during the training and hence boost the trained model quality.  © 2023 IEEE."
"Questions have long revolved around the European Union’s (EU) capacity to develop ‘post-national’ political myths–sacred narratives that provide a basis for long-term political legitimacy. The need for new EU political myths has become particularly severe with the declining power of the Union’s foundational myths of peace and prosperity, and as the EU has entered an era of almost permanent crisis. This article critically assesses whether one contemporary EU policy innovation–the European Green Deal (EGD)–has the potential to transform from a set of policies and an accompanying narrative into a sacred narrative for the Union. The analysis is conducted by applying a novel framework that assesses a myth’s features, including significance, development, and impact, to draw conclusions about the EGD’s mythic capacity. Drawing on key speeches, texts, and Eurobarometer findings, the conclusion is drawn that the EGD does have mythic capacity in terms of its significance and development. However, its impact has been limited by critical voices on both sides of the climate action debate. This conclusion has important implications for the possibilities of post-national mythmaking. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
"In the short text, the extremely short length, feature sparsity, and high ambiguity pose huge challenges to classification tasks. Recently, as an effective method for tuning Pre-trained Language Models for specific downstream tasks, prompt-learning has attracted a vast amount of attention and research. The main intuition behind the prompt-learning is to insert the template into the input and convert the tasks into equivalent cloze-style tasks. However, most prompt-learning methods only consider the class name and monotonous strategy for knowledge incorporating in cloze-style prediction, which will inevitably incur omissions and bias in short text classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a short text classification method with prompt-learning. Specifically, the top <inline-formula><tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$M$</tex-math></inline-formula> concepts related to the entity in the short text are retrieved from the open Knowledge Graph like Probase, these concepts are first selected by the distance with class labels, which takes both the short text itself and the class name into consideration during expanding label word space. Then, we conducted four additional strategies for the integration of the expanded concepts, and the union of these concepts are adopted finally in the verbalizer of prompt-learning. Experimental results show that the obvious improvement is obtained compared with other state-of-the-art methods on five well-known datasets. IEEE"
"For a long time, most gyrotron oscillators have avoided using TM modes because of the concerns about strong bunching competition and relatively weak beam<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$-$</tex-math> </inline-formula>wave coupling.

Considering the modes excited at the fundamental cyclotron harmonic, the TE<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{\text{12}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> mode remains to be the only competitor to the targeted TM<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{\text{12}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> mode; however, it will be effectively suppressed by the axial velocity spread.

Nonetheless, as the modes at high cyclotron harmonics are included, the second-harmonic TE<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{\text{24}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> mode and the third-harmonic TE<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{\text{36}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula> mode would potentially hazard the proposed TM<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=""LaTeX"">$_{\text{12}}$</tex-math> </inline-formula>-mode operation.

"Multi-modal emotion analysis, as an important direction in affective computing, has attracted increasing attention in recent years. Most existing multi-modal emotion recognition studies are targeted at a classification task that aims to assign a specific emotion category to a combination of several heterogeneous input data, including multimedia signals and physiological signals. Compared to single-class emotion recognition, a growing number of recent psychological evidence suggests that different discrete emotions may co-exist at the same time, which promotes the development of mixed-emotion recognition to identify a mixture of basic emotions. Although most current studies treat it as a multi-label classification task, in this work, we focus on a challenging situation where both positive and negative emotions are presented simultaneously, and propose a multi-modal mixed emotion recognition framework, namely EmotionDict. The key characteristics of our EmotionDict include the following. (1) Inspired by the psychological evidence that such a mixed state can be represented by combinations of basic emotions, we address mixed emotion recognition as a label distribution learning task. An emotion dictionary has been designed to disentangle the mixed emotion representations into a weighted sum of a set of basic emotion elements in a shared latent space and their corresponding weights. (2) While many existing emotion distribution studies are built on a single type of multimedia signal (such as text, image, audio, and video), we incorporate physiological and overt behavioral multi-modal signals, including electroencephalogram (EEG), peripheral physiological signals, and facial videos, which directly display the subjective emotions. These modalities have diverse characteristics given that they are related to the central or peripheral nervous system, and the motor cortex. (3) We further design auxiliary tasks to learn modality attentions for modality integration. Experiments on two datasets show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on mixed-emotion recognition. IEEE"

"Background/purpose –The unprecedented developments in AI-based technologies and large language models such as ChatGPT have exhibited a brand-new territory to be explored. Since its first release in November 2022, the potential utility of ChatGPT has garnered incremental attention in the scientific world, and has already accumulated a great number of studies from diverse fields. The current study was conducted with the purpose of exploring the scientific landscape of the evolving knowledge base related to the use of ChatGPT in the field of education and health through science mapping analysis of published research. Materials/methods – Data were retrieved from Web of Science and Scopus, and a comparative, period-based science mapping analysis was conducted using the SciMAT software. Results – The results showed that the studies published during the first period mostly focused on machine learning, reproductive medicine, education and first-year undergraduate themes. During the second period, though, the studies featured themes that are closely related to the design and performance of ChatGPT such as large language models (LLMs), natural language processing (NLP) and chatbot while abandoning a focus on artificial intelligence. These results imply that discussions and investigations over ChatGPT were being departed from those in the field of artificial intelligence, and the focus was becoming more central to the features of ChatGPT as a language model that can process huge amounts of information to generate human-like texts. Plagiarism and research ethics were also emerging themes during the last period. Conclusion – The results of the science mapping showed a growing interest into the opportunities and risks of ChatGPT, particularly for fields of education and medicine, and indicated that much research is warranted to discover the potential of GPT technology as an uncharted territory.

"In 1875, João Martins Teixeira, then professor at the Medical School of Rio de Janeiro, published the textbook Noções de chimica geral (Notions of general chemistry). The work concludes with a section dedicated to the history of chemistry, whose final text is entitled “A chimica entre nós” (Chemistry among us). In the present work, after outlining the conditions of production of the textbook and reviewing some researches on it, we carry out a meta-historiographical analysis of this pioneering text, examining its nature as a source on the history of chemistry teaching in Brazil, its use of the term “scientific revolution” and its possible philosophical inspirations (regarding statements about scientific work). The article ends with a transcription of “A chimica entre nós”, with updated spelling. ©2023 Sociedade Brasileira de Química."
"The authors thank the discusser for the attention and interests on our previous work, entitled “Seismic damage analysis due to near-fault multipulse ground motion” (referred to as the original paper/work in the following text). To demonstrate the increased seismic demands required by multipulse ground motions compared to non- and single-pulse ground motions, three cases were illustrated in the original work, including frame structures, a soil slope and a concrete dam. The discusser, Dr M.Amin Hariri-Ardebili, raised concerns on the seismic response of the dam, together with the optimal intensity measure of ground motions. Specifically, four subissues are involved, including effectiveness of the numerical model of dam, the damage index for dam, the selection strategy for input ground motions, and the ground motion intensity measures. Detailed responses to these issues are provided. In short, the main conclusion in the original paper that the multipulse ground motions potentially cause more severe damage compared to non- and single-pulse ground motions is reliable. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
"This study was aimed to analyze in detail how the fatigue effects to kinematic parameters of body weight squat exercise (BSQ) by dividing a squat cycle into four different regions. Twenty-one male athletes participated in this study. Participants were divided into two groups according to their lower limb muscle ratio (LLMR). The BSQ was performed until participants were unable to continue the exercise due to the fatigue. Linear and angular kinematics were obtained by motion analysis software which has high validity and reliability. There was no significant but had large effect size interaction between fatigue conditions and LLMR groups in terms of knee ROM in the extension phase and hip angular velocity in braking phase of the flexion (0.08 > p >0.05, 0.18 > [Formula: see text] > 0.16). Fatigue condition did not have a significant effect on the duration in the acceleration and braking phases of BSQ (p > 0.05). There were many significant main effects on kinematics in the different regions due to the fatigue (0.01 < p <0.05, 0.44 > [Formula: see text] > 0.14). In the fatigue condition, there was a polynomial relationship between velocity of shoulder and hip joints (R2flex = 0.82, R2ext = 0.72) rather than linear (R2flex = 0.64, R2ext = 0.53) and coefficient correlations also decreased (rflex = 0.88 to 0.80, rext = 0.92 to 0.73). The sticking region was observed in the non-fatigue condition and disappeared when fatigue occurred. These results suggest that LLMR may be taken into consideration in the squat exercises, joint tracking may vary for velocity-based squat training and pre-test for sticking region observation may be apply with the BSQ.

"Phytosterols/phytostanols are bioactive compounds found in vegetable oils, nuts, and seeds and added to a range of commercial food products. Consumption of phytosterols/phytostanols reduces levels of circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a causative biomarker of cardiovascular disease, and is linked to a reduced risk of some cancers. Individuals who consume phytosterols/phytostanols in their diet may do so for many years as part of a non-pharmacological route to lower cholesterol or as part of a healthy diet. However, the impact of long-term or high-intakes of dietary phytosterols/phytostanols has not been on whole-body epigenetic changes before. The aim of this systematic review was to identify all publications that have evaluated changes to epigenetic mechanisms (post-translation modification of histones, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression) in response to phytosterols/phytostanols. A systematic search was performed that returned 226 records, of which eleven were eligible for full text analysis. Multiple phytosterols were found to inhibit expression of histone deacetylase enzymes and were also predicted to directly bind and impair histone deacetylase activity. Phytosterols were found to inhibit the expression and activity of DNA methyl transferase enzyme 1 and reverse cancer associated gene silencing. Finally, phytosterols have been shown to regulate over 200 miRNAs, although only five of these were reported in multiple publications. Five tissue types (breast, prostate, macrophage, aortic epithelia, lung) were represented across the studies, and although phytosterols/phytostanols alter the molecular mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance in these mammalian cells, studies exploring mitotic or transgenerational inheritance were not found.  © The Authors 2023."
"The article discusses the need to use innovative educational technologies such as problem-based and project-based learning. The study describes models for gradually teaching students the scientific style of speech, the result of which should be the creation of their own scientific text. The acquired skills in composing scientific texts are necessary both in the process of studying at the university and for the formation of professional language competence of future specialists. The work analyzes the language tools used in the creation of scientific texts, and proposes a methodology aimed at developing in students the skills of conscious use of language tools characteristic of the scientific style of speech. The purpose of the study is to describe the results of mastering the stages of the proposed methodology, as a result of which students master the skills of writing abstracts, abstracts for participation in a conference. © 2023 IEEE."
"Objective: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that significantly impacts the quality of life of affected individuals. Telehealth interventions (TIs) have emerged as a promising avenue for providing healthcare services remotely, potentially improving outcomes and enhancing the quality of life for people with MS. This systematic review aims to assess the impact and efficacy of TIs on outcomes of people with MS by synthesizing and comparing outcomes from related randomized controlled trials. Methods: The systematic review protocol will involve searching electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, EMBASE, CENTRAL), gray literature resources, and key journals from 1997 to June 2023 for keywords related to Telehealth and MS. The collection of research-related articles will be followed by the removal of duplicates before they are included in the study. During the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the articles will be reviewed, and irrelevant articles will be excluded. The full text of relevant articles will be independently evaluated by two researchers, and data will be extracted from the final articles. The findings will be classified and recorded in an extraction table. The risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. The data will be analyzed using STATA version 14.2. The PROSPERO ID for this study is CRD42023450081. Discussion: This study aims to address the current knowledge gap by investigating the comparative effectiveness of TIs. The findings of this research will provide valuable insights and evidence regarding the effectiveness of these interventions, assess their feasibility and accessibility, examine patient outcomes, identify research gaps, and offer guidance for clinical practice and policy-making. © The Author(s) 2023."
"In efforts to pay homage to the establishment of nationalities, there is precedence in creating a binary opposition of “us” and “them” in some narrative contexts. This discursive construction within the narrative starts with the labeling of social elements, then proceeds to generalize the negative attributions, and then culminates elaborately in justifying the exclusion of many and the inclusion of some. Discourse Historical Analysis is a critical attempt to study power relations as reflected in the language of a (literary) text. The Book of Esther in the Old Testament recounts the story of the exiled Jews in Persia and the ill-fated conspiracy of the Persian prince to exterminate them. The most common opinion about the time and date of its composition is that it was composed among the Jewish diaspora in Persia during the reign of Xerxes I. The consolidation of their own Jewish nationality was indispensable while living an exiled life in Persia. As such, they cling to the idea of positive Jew and negative Persian representation in their recounts of the story of Esther in the Persian court. The interest in this biblical story has been maintained in numerous literary works. The focus of the present study is on the six late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century American plays that speak to this phenomenon. In light of Ruth Wodak’s DHA (2003), the present article studies the power relations between the Persian regal host and the expatriate Jews in these dramatic texts. Essentially concerned with the study of conflicting ideologies in the social and political; spheres, the discursive function of language in the construction of a diasporic nationality is highlighted herein. © 2023 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA."
"The article is a reflection on the monograph by Ludmila N. Mazur and Oleg V. Gorbachev ""Soviet films about the village: the experience of historical interpretation of the artistic image"" (2022). It is dedicated to the methodological, theoretical, and specific-object issues of studying the Soviet feature films as a unique source on the history of the Russian village of the 20th century. Particular attention is paid to the specifics of transcribing, ""reading"" and interpretation by the authors of the monograph of the cinematographic text, the identification of its informative impact in the reconstruction of the main plots of Soviet rural history and rural daily life. A scrupulous analysis of the Soviet ""village"" filmography of the 1920s − early 1990s allowed the authors of the book to consider this cinema as an example of a clear social order, which represents the transforming position of the authorities in relation to the Soviet peasantry. However, at the same time it allows to obtain exclusive information about the life of the Soviet village, missing in sources of other type and species. © 2023 Aquilo. All rights reserved."
"The performance of learning models heavily relies on the availability and adequacy of training data. To address the dataset adequacy issue, researchers have extensively explored data augmentation (DA) as a promising approach. DA generates new data instances through transformations applied to the available data, thereby increasing dataset size and variability. This approach has enhanced model performance and accuracy, particularly in addressing class imbalance problems in classification tasks. However, few studies have explored DA for the Arabic language, relying on traditional approaches such as paraphrasing or noising-based techniques. In this paper, we propose a new Arabic DA method that employs the recent powerful modeling technique, namely the AraGPT-2, for the augmentation process. The generated sentences are evaluated in terms of context, semantics, diversity, and novelty using the Euclidean, cosine, Jaccard, and BLEU distances. Finally, the AraBERT transformer is used on sentiment classification tasks to evaluate the classification performance of the augmented Arabic dataset. The experiments were conducted on four sentiment Arabic datasets: AraSarcasm, ASTD, ATT, and MOVIE. The selected datasets vary in size, label number, and unbalanced classes. The results show that the proposed methodology enhanced the Arabic sentiment text classification on all datasets with an increase in F1 score by 7% in AraSarcasm, 8% in ASTD, 11% in ATT, and 13% in MOVIE. ©2023 The Authors.

"A bidirectional phonetizer, morphologizer, and diacritizer pipeline (FSPMD) for modern standard Arabic (MSA) that integrated pronunciation, concatenative and templatic morphology, and diacritization were developed. Grammar and segmental phonology rules were applied in the forward direction to ensure the order of the proper rules, which were supplemented with special backward direction rules. The FSPMD comprises bidirectional finitestate transducers (FSTs) consisting of an ordered composition of FSTs, unordered parallel FSTs, unioned FSTs, and for validity, finitestate acceptors. The FSPMD has unique, innovative features and can be used as an integrated pipeline or standalone phonetizer (FSAP), morphologizer (FSAM), or diacritizer (FSAD). As the system is bidirectional, it can be used in forward (generation, synthesis) and backward (analysis, decomposition) directions and can be integrated into systems such as automatic speech recognition (ASR) and language learning tools. The FSPMD is rulebased and avoids stem listings for morphology or pronunciation dictionaries, which makes it scalable and generalizable to similar languages. The FSPMD models authentic rules, including fine granularity and nuances, such as rewrite and morphophonemic rules, subcategory identification and utilization, such as irregular verbs. FSAP performance regarding text from the Tashkeela corpus and Wikipedia demonstrated that the pronunciation system can accurately pronounce all text and words, with the only errors related to foreign words and misspellings, which were out of the system’s scope. FSAM and FSAD coverage and accuracy were evaluated using the Tashkeela corpus and a gold standard derived from its intersection with the UD_PADT treebank. The coverage of extraction of root and properties from words is 82%. Accuracy results are roots computed from a word (92%), words generated from a root (100%), nonroot properties (97%), and diacritization (84%). FSAM nonroot results matched and/or surpassed those from MADAMIRA; however, root result comparisons were not conducted because of the concatenative nature of publicly available morphologizers. © (2023), (Science and Information Organization).

"This article shines light on the interconnectedness of reproductive labour and Latin American literature through two Chilean novels that explore the relationship between peripheral capitalism and domestic servitude: José Donoso's The Obscene Bird of Night and Diamela Eltit's Mano de Obra. The study of these texts allows for a periodisation of the reproductive sphere under different phases of capitalist accumulation, and exposes an association between the literary treatment of domestic service and the achievement of highly experimental narratives in Latin America. My reading of Obscene goes beyond viewing this novel as postmodernist fiction, by showing how its nightmarish poetics are a consequence of the transformation of the oligarchic household vis-a-vis the collapse of systems of bonded labour in the 1960s. Whereas the prose of Obscene provides a harrowing descent into the intimate connections between master and servant at the moment of their decline, Mano de Obra unveils a surgical prose capable of expressing the new impersonality of social reproduction in the subsequent neoliberal period. Of special interest to this analysis is how Eltit suggests that even the proletariat household can recreate exploitative patterns of domestic servitude to guard against complete immiseration. Three main conclusions result from this reading. First, Latin American fiction is an important literary archive from which capitalism's exploitation of the reproductive sphere can be excavated. Second, Latin American literature shows formal uniqueness when representing domestic service in the periphery. Lastly, fictional representations of domestic service help us understand the institution not as remnant of previous modes of production, but as capitalist strategy for the reproduction of social forces that underpay the cost of life-making processes. © The Author(s) 2023."
"The identification of key concepts within unstructured data is of paramount importance in practical applications. Despite the abundance of proposed methods for extracting primary topics, only a few works investigated the influence of text length on the performance of keyword extraction (KE) methods. Specifically, many studies lean on abstracts and titles for content extraction from papers, leaving it uncertain whether leveraging the complete content of papers can yield consistent results. Hence, in this study, we employ a network-based approach to evaluate the concordance between keywords extracted from abstracts and those from the entire papers. Community detection methods are utilized to identify interconnected papers in citation networks. Subsequently, paper clusters are formed to identify salient terms within each cluster, employing a methodology akin to the term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf) approach. Once each cluster has been endowed with its distinctive set of key terms, these selected terms are employed to serve as representative keywords at the paper level. The top-ranked words at the cluster level, which also appear in the abstract, are chosen as keywords for the paper. Our findings indicate that although various community detection methods used in KE yield similar levels of accuracy. Notably, text clustering approaches outperform all citation-based methods, while all approaches yield relatively low accuracy values. We also identified a lack of concordance between keywords extracted from the abstracts and those extracted from the corresponding full-text source. Considering that citations and text clustering yield distinct outcomes, combining them in hybrid approaches could offer improved performance. Copyright: © 2023 Tohalino et al.

"With the rapid development of natural language processing technology, text segmentation has become an important task in text processing. However, existing text segmentation methods often perform poorly when faced with long texts and complex structures, requiring a more efficient and accurate approach. In this paper, we propose a new text segmentation method based on the Hierarchical Document Attention (HDA), which automatically identifies and segments different paragraphs in the text by analyzing and weighting the hierarchical structure of the text sequence data. Compared with existing methods, the model has higher accuracy and efficiency, and better supports tasks such as text analysis and information extraction. The main contribution of this paper is the proposal of a text segmentation method based on the HDA, which effectively models text sequences through multi-level attention mechanisms. Experimental verification on public datasets shows that this model exhibits good performance in text segmentation tasks.  © 2013 IEEE."
